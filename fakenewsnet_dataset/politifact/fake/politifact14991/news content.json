Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was \u201cbuilt by immigrants.\u201d\n\nFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not \u201cimmigrants\u201d but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/Child-with-doctor-at-hospital-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/November-28-2023-pneumonia-rsv-children-hospital-china-iv-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/09/Nikki-Haley-New-Hampshire-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/06/biden-carrying-air-force-academy-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/GettyImages-1806604323-e1701189552281-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/wi/ap/election-2024-haley-gop-presidential-hopeful-nikki-haley-speaks-campaign-event-monday-nov-27-2023-1-200x133.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/09/GettyImages-1241456824_uhj-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/GettyImages-1244662761-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/epc-spc-11-28-23-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/AP23328761123984-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/05/GettyImages-1173668146-e1683905024463-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/captainmarvelSarahConnor1-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/GettyImages-1206560552-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/Stephen-Hovanic-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/AP23330692708555-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/GettyImages-1756948825-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/Rabbi-Simon-Jacobson-and-Argentina\u2019s-President-elect-Javier-Milei-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/Joe-Biden-Getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/11/zelensky-nato-2-getty-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2023/01/Puppy-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "theme-color": "#FF5500", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "description": "Rep.
