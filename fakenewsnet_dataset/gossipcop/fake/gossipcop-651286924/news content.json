Getty\n\n\"The ring is obviously yellow gold because that's [Markle's] favorite and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana and the little diamonds either side are from my mother's jewelry collection, to make sure that she's with us on this crazy journey together,\" Harry said during the couple's first sit-down interview with the BBC.\n\n\"It's incredible,\" Markle said of Harry's gesture. \"Everything about Harry\u2019s thoughtfulness and the inclusion of [Princess Diana\u2019s stones] and obviously not being able to meet his mom, it\u2019s so important to me to know that she\u2019s a part of this with us.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s incredibly special to be able to have this [ring], which sort of links where you come form and Botswana, which is important to us. It's perfect,\" she told the BBC.\n\nThe redesign\n\nFollowing the birth of baby Archie in May of 2019, Prince Harry gave Meghan a third ring, an eternity band, which he reportedly designed with jeweler Lorraine Schwartz. Schwartz also resized and reset Meghan's engagement ring.\n\nMeghan debuted her redesigned three-stone engagement ring at Trooping the Colour this year. It now features a thin micro-pav\u00e9 band, as opposed to the original solid yellow gold one.\n\nSee a comparison of the two rings here:\n\nThe photo on the left from Trooping the Colour shows Meghan\u2019s redesigned ring, with a thinner pave band. The photo on the right show the original design.
