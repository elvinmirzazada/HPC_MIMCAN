While we don\u2019t see Stone herself as the anti-puppy type, her casting comes as no surprise\u2014not only because the actress has spent the better part of her career proving she can drive almost any film in a starring role, but also because we can already imagine her in that signature color-blocked bob.\n\nStone has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job. Take 2009\u2019s Zombieland, for which she dipped her natural blonde locks a dark chocolate. While she\u2019s often thought of as a redhead, she\u2019s actually only donned the fiery color for fun and film, trying everything from the warm cinnamon of Irrational Man to the auburn waves in Gangster Squad. Even as a blonde she\u2019s left no shade unturned: The Help may be significant for those wild curls, but we\u2019ll remember it for her pitch-perfect strawberry hue. Spiderman 2 saw her go paler still, but her part in Birdman took the peroxide even further with a shock of near-white layers. Now, as Cruella, she\u2019ll wear both the visual equivalent of the absence of color and every single color at once. Above, a look at seven films that prove that if anyone is up for a hair-color challenge, it\u2019s Emma Stone.", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6387e1dff35d500dca842bc5/4:3/pass/undefined", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6551791bf955d76e314179d0/4:3/pass/undefined", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/account-avatar.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df058aa89a00d54298e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/03-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo-header.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6565ffc04e2f3422731f153f/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914dee23f9887c0e0e031e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/01-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/65577fd2451cf9d6ffa1c0f4/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6563a3c2600a70d6237e00b7/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914def4fe15261130212f8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/02-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/65661f61724dbeb7806e1742/4:3/pass/undefined", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/emma-stone-hair-color-cruella-de-vil", "title": "Emma Stone\u2019s Next Role Will Have the Most Extreme Hair Color Yet", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "The actress\u2014who has just been cast as Cruella de Vil\u2014has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job.", "id": "58914df5fb0604bf1f5c22cd", "keywords": "emma stone,hair color", "news_keywords": "emma stone,hair color", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58914df5fb0604bf1f5c22cd", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The actress\u2014who has just been cast as Cruella de Vil\u2014has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg\"}", "og": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Emma Stone\u2019s Next Role Will Have the Most Extreme Hair Color Yet", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/emma-stone-hair-color-cruella-de-vil"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2016-04-26T15:55:12.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T15:55:12.000Z", "author": "Vogue"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Emma Stone\u2019s Next Role Will Have the Most Extreme Hair Color Yet"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1461686112.0, "source": "http://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
