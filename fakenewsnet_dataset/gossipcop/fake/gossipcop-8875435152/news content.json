The tabloid got a detailed report on how madly in love Swift is with Alwyn's and her secret(ish) relationship.\n\n\u201cJoe has really showed her a different lifestyle and the value of privacy,\u201d a source told the outlet. \u201cShe\u2019s the happiest she\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nThis shift has drastically improved Swift's life, a source added. \u201cTaylor is so much happier without her personal life in the open. She credits Joe for that and realizes how much better off she is.\u201d\n\nSwift, for one of the first times in the public eye, has not talked about Alwyn in any interviews. She has barely been photographed out with him, though this week they were shot holding hands in Turks and Caicos. \u201cThey seemed genuinely happy,\u201d a witness there told Us of their interactions out and about there. \u201cThey were always smiling and close to each other, but kept to themselves.\u201d\n\nSwift isn't about to say anything about Alwyn though, another source cautioned the outlet. The couple \u201cvowed to keep their relationship to themselves. They\u2019ve done everything they can to keep it that way.\u201d", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1129881970-656530ea85671.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.845xh;0,0.0189xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1661085424-656499f1de1f2.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.115xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jordyn-woods-and-kylie-jenner-attend-the-louis-vuitton-news-photo-1701099275.jpg?crop=0.665xw:1.00xh;0.268xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/catherine-princess-of-wales-prince-william-prince-of-wales-news-photo-1701128802.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.258xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=160:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-and-prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-news-photo-1701135762.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.758xh;0,0.0316xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/search.f1c199c.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-joe-1521038845.jpg?resize=640:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.242fea1.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/saved.ad81f1a.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lawrence-kylie-jenner-gettyimages-1804969181-6564c0f2734ad.jpg?crop=0.484xw:0.968xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/tiktok.603c377.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-gettyimages-1792300484-655b71a0c723c.jpg?crop=0.492xw:0.984xh;0.508xw,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=navLogoColor", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/selena-gomez-spl10011196-018-6564d9e88f826.jpg?crop=0.478xw:0.318xh;0.282xw,0.152xh&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=120:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brie-larson-and-elijah-allan-blitz-are-seen-at-jimmy-kimmel-news-photo-1680729481.jpg?crop=0.689xw:1.00xh;0.156xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/elle-burn-ballads-babyface-ak-v1-65283d375ffe8.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-travis-gettyimages-1677323526-65047cd294e48.jpg?crop=0.484xw:0.968xh;0.516xw,0&resize=360:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/liam-hemsworth-and-gabriella-brooks-attend-the-australian-news-photo-1668540012.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.168xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-joe-1521038845.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/x.3361b6d.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1609347579-1-65649f46d00fc.jpg?crop=0.226xw:0.339xh;0.356xw,0.204xh&resize=360:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-joe-1521038845.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a22108837/taylor-swift-loving-joe-alwyn-privacy-relationship-report/", "title": "Taylor Swift Madly in Love With Joe Alwyn and Privacy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Taylor Swift Madly in Love With Joe Alwyn and Privacy - How Taylor and Joe Are Doing Keeping Romance Secret", "description": "Bless Joe Alwyn for teaching Taylor Swift the value of keeping her personal life private, \u200bUs Weekly\u200b \u200benthusiastically reports, because her happiness these days is unparalleled!
