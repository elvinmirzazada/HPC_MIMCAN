Dean McDermott is probably best known for being the former husband of Tori Spelling.\n\nDean has more than 80 acting credits to his name, including the films \"A Cool, Dry Place\" (1998) and \"Against the Ropes\" (2004) and the television series \"Due South\" (1995), \"Power Play\" (1998), and \"1-800-Missing\" (2003). McDermott and Spelling have starred in the reality TV series \"Tori & Dean: Inn Love\"/\"Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood\" (2007\u20132012), \"Tori & Dean: sTORIbook Weddings\" (2010), \"Tori & Dean: Cabin Fever\" (2014), and \"True Tori\" (2014), and Dean served as an executive producer on all of those shows except \"Tori & Dean: Cabin Fever.\" A professionally trained chef, McDermott hosted \"Chopped Canada\" (2014) and appeared on \"Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off\" (2013) and \"Top Chef Canada\" (2014), and he published the cookbook \"The Gourmet Dad: Easy and Delicious Meals the Whole Family Will Love\" in 2015.\n\nFinancial Situation\n\nIn October 2013, Tori made the shocking announcement that she was broke and had squandered away every penny she had ever made to the point where she was borrowing money from her mother to pay rent and could not afford a simple medical procedure for her husband. Spelling claimed to have blown through every dollar she ever made acting or inherited from her late father (an estimated $15 \u2013 $20 million) on failed real estate investments and lavish purchases for her family. When asked about her exact net worth, Tori replied:\n\n\"I don't have one million dollars. We had some income here and there, but no savings apart from our retirement accounts.\"\n\nMcDermott clarified her statements the next day by telling \"US Weekly\":\n\n\"Right now things are going well. Tori and I are doing just fine financially.\"\n\nIn March 2017, City National Bank filed a lawsuit against Tori and Dean after they failed to pay off $200,000 out of a $400,000 loan. City National also claims that Tori overdrew $17,000 from her checking account. A few months earlier the couple was sued by American Express for $87,000 in credit card debt and $260,000 in unpaid taxes.\n\nIn October 2017, court documents filed by Dean's ex-wife Mary Jo Eustace alleged that months after she had taken him to court for his failure to pay alimony, he had stopped paying child support. Eustace stated:\n\n\"In the last six weeks he has been on two luxurious vacations, Iceland & the Four Seasons in Punta Mita. He resides in a $2 million estate paid by his mother-in-law, Candy Spelling, and has no impetus to work. He owes over $100,000 moving forward, and I believe he has no intention of paying. He bounces my son's university rent/tuition and is delinquent in paying therapist bills, while he shops visibly and throws lavish parties for his other five children.\"\n\nIn October 2023 Dean was reportedly photographed waiting in line at a welfare office in Southern California. Around this time he was also reported to be living in a rented apartment unit with four roommates.\n\nEarly Life\n\nDean McDermott was born on November 16, 1966, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
