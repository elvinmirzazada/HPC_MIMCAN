A judge in the couple\u2019s ongoing divorce case said in the documents that \u201cit is critical that each of [the six] children have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother,\u201d and that Jolie must allow Pitt to maintain and repair that.\n\nFamily law attorney David Glass, who is not associated with the case, tells PEOPLE that it \u201cis extremely rare\u201d to see a court intervene in this way, though they typically do so after extensive evaluation and to prevent children from being alienated from one parent.\n\nJason Merritt/Getty\n\n\u201cIt looks like what this judge was weighing was the difference between estrangement and alienation,\u201d says Glass, who has not had access to the court documents. \u201cThe difference there is, estrangement is when children aren\u2019t connected to one of the parents, mainly because of something that parent did. So a hypothetical, if dad screams and yells at the kids and doesn\u2019t treat them nicely, the kids stop wanting to see dad, that\u2019s estrangement. An alienation refers to where children have been told by the other parent that the parent they\u2019re not seeing is bad, or doesn\u2019t like them, or doesn\u2019t care about them. Just talking badly about the other parent and the kids start to internalize what the other parent is telling them. In alienation cases, kids will typically just repeat words that are beyond their years, or they will repeat reasons that they don\u2019t possibly have access to the information.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a rare case where the court will find that someone alienated the kids. It takes a lot to move the court past estrangement into alienation, but once it\u2019s determined that one parent is alienating the kids, the court has no choice but to jump in and make pretty strong orders right away.\u201d\n\nThe judge also outlined specific steps Jolie should take to aid Pitt\u2019s access to and relationship with the children, including a detailed summer visitation schedule, and easy phone access between Pitt and each of the kids, without monitoring or interference from their mom. Glass says that the goal of the new guidelines is to \u201ctry to figure out what\u2019s in the children\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nDia Dipasupil/FilmMagic\n\n\u201cThe schedule worked out by the court is the typical post-alienation reunification schedule,\u201d he says. \u201cYou see them a couple hours a day and that starts leading to full days and eventually if things go well it leads to overnights, so you\u2019re slowly acclimating the kids to the parent who\u2019s been cut out of the kids lives.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Brad Pitt Is \u2018in a Better Place\u2019 Amid Divorce Proceedings with Angelina Jolie: Source\n\nAccording to the court documents, the kids have to continue to see their therapist with Pitt, which Glass says is a positive step.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first good news, that the kids are in therapy and that dad is somehow involved in the therapy. That\u2019s where the kids can work out whatever issues they have. It\u2019s that continuing contact with dad \u2026 all those little pieces that eventually lead to some sort of reunification with their dad.\u201d\n\nReps for both Jolie, 43, and Pitt, 54, have not yet responded to a request for comment. Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt on September 19, 2016.
