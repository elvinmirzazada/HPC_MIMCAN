I\u2019m not engaged. No, no,\u201d she said.\n\nRumors began swirling when JLo sported what some say looked like an engagement ring on that finger over July 4th weekend, but as The Blast exclusively reported, no engagement went down.\n\nShe continued to wear the ring on her wedding finger though, even displaying it this AM.\n\n\n\nMega\n\nWhen asked by the hosts if they ran off to tie the knot, she jokingly screamed, \u201cNO!\u201d\n\nAnd while no engagement or ceremony has happened for the couple of over a year, JLo couldn\u2019t stop gushing about her relationship with A-Rod.\n\n\u201cI think maybe if we would have met in our twenties, maybe not so much \u2026 we were both \u2026 we\u2019re too crazy,\u201d JLo said. \u201cBut now at this point in our lives, where we both have kids, we both have accomplished certain things in our careers and we\u2019re kinda in that second act of our lives, we really complement each other.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWhere I need help, he\u2019s really strong and where he needs help, I\u2019m really strong. When two people kind of just fit together really well, he and I are like that.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the kids, JLo says all four are amazing. \u201cI mean, of course I\u2019m going to say that cause I\u2019m their mom, but they are and they\u2019re sweet and they\u2019re loving and they deal with us and our lifestyle in such a great way,\u201d she said, referring to her twins and A-Rod\u2019s daughters, whom she just spent her birthday weekend with.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had other relationships where it\u2019s been tricky but with these four it really works nicely,\u201d she added.\n\n\n\nInstagram", "images": ["https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2022/12/Lauren-Drain-6.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/previous/5e736ffb8cdb45833d5d53319ce08498.jpg", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2021/05/social_share.png", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/11/23052327/MEGA920812_001-scaled-e1700745843267.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2021/06/theblast-logo.png", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/05/mega969047_009-scaled-e1683152435875.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/06/351212402_210130811415321_729079162123332625_n-1-scaled-e1686038610198.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/10/18075218/Jennifer-Lopez-goes-behind-the-scenes-in-Intimissimi-campaign-3-1-e1697640821921.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/11/28132341/Tina-Knowles-Beyonce.png?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/01/Jac_Cordeiro_Sunset-1-e1672758076858.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2022/12/Jac_Cordeiro_Close_Up-e1671725517586.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/02/Jennifer-Lopez-scaled-e1677182834994.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/03/Ben-Affleck-scaled-e1679033901884.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/08/14114030/tiffany-haddish-resize-e1692038599412.jpeg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/previous/fc1accb7e2737ddde987db2d2d1f1dff.jpg?aspect_ratio=13:6&width=1300", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2022/08/264433332_455250405991142_7252460253989518529_n-e1660840399559.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/01/mega890002_059-scaled-e1673888093855.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2022/05/MEGA382176_004-scaled-e1651600815845.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/02/Rumer-Willis-2-scaled-e1677595832527.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/previous/d85868aa3307fa779b605222dbf4d0c5.jpg"], "top_img": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2021/05/social_share.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/53081/jennifer-lopez-denies-engagement-rumors-alex-rodriguez/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Shoots Down Alex Rodriguez Engagement Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Shoots Down Alex Rodriguez Engagement Rumors", "description": "Jennifer Lopez did not secretly wed Alex Rodriguez and she\u2019s still not engaged, this coming straight from the horse\u2019s mouth.
