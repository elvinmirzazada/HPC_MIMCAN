All The Baby Rumors Over Nearly 20 Years Source: Getty\n\nNot all women want to have children, and that's perfectly OK. While \"normal\" people are pressured by friends and family to get pregnant, celebrities are pressured by the whole world. And compared to other celebs, nobody has been more publicly pressured than Jennifer Aniston. The world is obsessed with her having a baby!

Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war \"Jennifer Aniston Pregnant\" was still searched more than \"are we at war\" on Google.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nJennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends\u2014and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant\u2014could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn't she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.\n\nOver time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same. Rumors start any time she is wearing a loose shirt or looks \"bloated,\" whenever she is in a new relationship, and whenever that relationship ends. And most importantly, the rumors evolve as she ages.

One claimed she was pregnant with twins, but they both shared the same story that a doctor helped her and John was ecstatic. The couple broke up that year and the obsession with her pregnancy continued with some interesting spins. While Brad was married to Angelina rumors about a love triangle swirled.

I\u2019m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of \u2018journalism,\u2019 the \u2018First Amendment\u2019 and \u2018celebrity news.'\u201d\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n2017: Jen\u2019s Miracle Baby Joy At 48\n\nWhen Jennifer was 48-years-old, headlines about her reported pregnancy with Justin often included the word \"miracle.\" According to a gossip magazine, \u201cThe couple made the surprise announcement to family and friends last week, revealing their \u2018one last attempt\u2019 to fall pregnant had given them the miracle news they had been waiting for.\" The rumors went further and another source contended \u201cJen\u2019s pregnancy may turn to double joy,\u201d because \u201cthe couple had been investigating adopting a baby from Puerto Rico\u201d following Hurricane Maria. There was never a baby or an adoption and Jennifer spoke out\u2014again\u2014about the rumors. \u201cI would say, I think the best one would be a picture of me with a hand over my stomach, saying \u2018Finally Pregnant!\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like they take a picture of you and create this story. If your body is in a normal moment of having had a bite or two, or you\u2019re having a moment of bloat, then there\u2019s arrows circled around your stomach, telling you that you\u2019re pregnant. And it\u2019s like, actually no, it\u2019s just my body. Not that it\u2019s any of your business to begin with. Having a child, as we know, is no one\u2019s business except the couple or individual that\u2019s going through it.\" Despite her plea, rumors started again in 2017 that Jennifer hired a surrogate.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n2018: Jennifer Aniston Pregnant With Brad Pitt\u2019s Baby\n\nSource: Getty\n\nJennifer and Justin announced that they would be splitting in a joint statement in February of 2018.
