Every day she spent with Ben out in the world for people to see felt like another day of public scrutiny, but her love for Ben was worth it. They both learned to stick by each other during those painful months.\u201d\n\nThe source adds that \u201cBen has worked incredibly hard on his sobriety and Lindsay has been his rock. He will be forever grateful for all her love and support. They are both constantly being asked if they are planning to tie the knot, but for now they taking it one day at a time.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the source says the Justice League star is in no rush to get married again. \"Ben knows he loves Lindsay, but he wants to take things slow for the sake of his sobriety.
