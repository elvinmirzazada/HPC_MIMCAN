He and Meghan Markle reportedly told friends that they would be getting married before Christmas in the Caribbean.\n\nEarlier this month, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made their first public appearance as a couple at Tom Inskip and Lara Hughes-Young\u2019s destination wedding in Jamaica. There, the 32-year-old royal\u2019s friends joked that he would be the next to tie the knot. And according to Vanity Fair, Prince Harry had confided to his friends that he hoped to get married soon.\n\nThe report quoted a friend as telling Royal Watch that some of them \u201creally\u201d thought that he would propose to Meghan Markle by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cHarry is head over heels about Meghan and some of us really think he\u2019ll have popped the question by the end of the year.\u201d\n\nAnother report speculated that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would get engaged this summer.

They are planning to move in together and make an apartment in Kensington Palace their new address.
