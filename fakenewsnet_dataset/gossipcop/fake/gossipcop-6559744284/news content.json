But even though she turns 64 on Jan. 26, she hasn\u2019t gone quietly into retirement.\n\nShe\u2019s giving us glimpses into her life today through her YouTube series, \u201cAbout Time For Yourself\u2026with Ellen.\u201d While it\u2019s billed as a series, it\u2019s more a collection of short \u2013 and in vintage Ellen style, hysterical -clips of new things she\u2019s trying to fill her days. Viewers have seen her attempt things such as making a margarita and crocheting with results that keep them laughing. \u201cHey everybody, how you doin\u2019?\u201d DeGeneres said to fans in a teaser promoting the show. \u201cLately, I\u2019ve been taking some time for just myself, away from the cameras, and I\u2019ve been having such a great time, I thought I would share some of what I\u2019ve been doing with you.\u201d\n\nIn retirement, she\u2019s also continued her serious work with The Ellen Fund, which supports global conservation efforts for endangered species. DeGeneres, a Louisiana native, can afford to be picky about the projects she chooses, having amassed millions through the years in her career in acting, comedy and talk shows, and through her side project \u2013 house flipping.\n\nEllen DeGeneres\u2019 Net Worth\n\nDeGeneres\u2019 net worth is estimated to be $380 million, according to Forbes, though by some estimates it\u2019s as high as $500 million. In 2020, DeGeneres made $84 million, retaining the No. 12 spot on Forbes\u2019 list of the highest-paid celebrities in the world. In 2022, Forbes ranked her No. 72 on its list of America\u2019s Self-Made Women. Her wife \u2014 actress Portia de Rossi \u2014 has her own $50 million fortune, Celebrity Net Worth reported.\n\nMake Your Money Work Better for You\n\nStarting out as a stand-up comedian, DeGeneres rose to fame as an actress, starring in the TV series \u201cEllen\u201d from 1994 to 1998 and \u201cThe Ellen Show\u201d from 2001 to 2002. Her daytime talk show, \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d debuted on Sept. 8, 2003, and aired until May 2022. Jennifer Aniston was the syndicated show\u2019s bookend, appearing in both the first and final episodes.\n\nDeGeneres has hosted the Oscars twice, in 2007 and in 2014. She made history during the 2014 gig by tweeting a group selfie with a gaggle of famous friends, including Meryl Streep, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts, Lupita Nyong\u2019o and Brad Pitt \u2014 a photo that later would become the most retweeted photo ever.\n\nDeGeneres famously voiced the character Dory in the 2003 Pixar film \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d and the 2016 sequel, \u201cFinding Dory.\u201d She\u2019s also found major success behind the camera with her own production company, A Very Good Production.\n\nForbes reported that in 2018, DeGeneres became the first woman to receive $20 million for a Netflix stand-up special.\n\nEllen DeGeneres\u2019 Business Ventures\n\nThe tech-savvy superstar launched the site Ellentube in 2014, which hosted exclusive video content from her talk show. In 2015, she also partnered with Vessel to debut one or two clips from \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d on the streaming site before they were available anywhere else.\n\nDeGeneres has also ventured into the beauty and fashion world. In 2009, she became the face of COVERGIRL. She also previously served as the spokeswoman for JCPenney and American Express. And her lifestyle brand, ED by Ellen, launched in 2015. The company\u2019s website is filled with apparel and accessories, as well as merchandise for the home \u2013 lighting, rugs, d\u00e9cor, dining, wallpaper, bath and bedding.\n\nMake Your Money Work Better for You\n\nIn late 2017, DeGeneres also debuted a game show titled \u201cEllen\u2019s Game of Games\u201d on NBC, expanding the popular games that have been featured on her talk show.\n\nEllen DeGeneres\u2019 Real Estate Portfolio\n\nDeGeneres and wife de Rossi have made a name for themselves as real estate magnates. The couple has a knack for purchasing swanky properties and unloading them to fellow celebrities. For example, they became landlord to musician Nick Jonas in 2015, renting one of their many homes to him.\n\nThe couple purchased a mid-century modern Los Angeles mansion in January 2014 for nearly $40 million and promptly sold it to Sean Parker six months later for $55 million. Previously, in May 2012, they sold their 15,000-square-foot Beverly Hills compound to Ryan Seacrest for $36.5 million. The couple also purchased Brad Pitt\u2019s former Malibu bachelor pad in 2011 for $12 million and sold it to cosmetics entrepreneur Victoria Jackson in 2012 for $13 million.\n\nIn March 2006 \u2014 prior to her marriage to de Rossi \u2014 DeGeneres sold a home in Hollywood Hills, California, to Will Ferrell for $9 million. She also sold former Google CEO Eric Schmidt a California home in 2007 for $20 million, which was later the site of Kim Kardashian\u2019s wedding to Kris Humphries in 2011.\n\nIn 2019, the couple spent $27 million on a five-bedroom, 10-bathroom property in Montecito, California, dubbed the Salt Hill estate, Architectural Digest reported, which added they sold it in 2020 for $33.3 million.\n\nBecause their real estate portfolio is fluid, total properties currently owned by the couple is unknown, but Architectural Digest said that in 2022, they bought four properties and sold three. One of the purchases was a $70 million property in Carpinteria, California, which set a record sales price in Santa Barbara County. The transaction included a five-bedroom, eight-bathroom Tuscan-style mansion and an adjacent piece of land. Other properties they own are in the exclusive California areas of Montecito and Bel Air.\n\nMake Your Money Work Better for You\n\nDeGeneres released her interior design book \u201cHome\u201d in 2015, which included photos and design tips from many of their past and present residences. Their former Thousand Oaks, California, ranch \u2014 which they sold in 2013 for $10.85 million \u2014 was featured in Elle D\u00e9cor.\n\nEllen DeGeneres\u2019 Honors and Awards\n\nIn November 2016, President Obama presented DeGeneres with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget now just how much courage was required for Ellen to come out on the most public of stages 20 years ago,\u201d Obama said.
