They\u2019re just guesses. Let them keep fishing.\n\nFebruary 1, 2018\n\nKylie and Travis welcome their daughter into the world, although they won\u2019t go public with the news for another three days.\n\nFebruary 4, 2018\n\nKylie announces the birth of their child via Instagram, writing:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for keeping you in the dark through all the assumptions. I understand you\u2019re used to me bringing you along on all my journeys. My pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world. I knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress-free, and healthy way I knew how. There was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal I had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.\u201d\n\nShe also releases an 11-minute video documenting her pregnancy and the days leading up to the birth of her daughter:\n\nTravis confirms the baby news on Twitter:\n\nKylie\u2019s family and friends also share welcome messages for the baby on social media:\n\nFebruary 18, 2018\n\nSpeaking to the paparazzi while leaving a nightclub in L.A., Travis is asked about his new baby girl. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he responds, via TMZ.

It\u2019s safe to say those words could also be applied to baby Stormi.\n\nMarch 8, 2018\n\nKylie causes a fan freakout after sharing a photo of herself wearing a ring with Travis\u2019s initials (his birth name is Jacques Webster) on her RING finger.

I want him to be him. I don\u2019t want it to be Kylie and Trav.

I\u2019m happy my relationship is strong because this is getting out of hand. The internet scares me sometimes for real.\u201d\n\nJanuary 18, 2019\n\nKylie and Travis go on a tropical vacation with Stormi and take a cute kissy pic.\n\nJanuary 21, 2019\n\nKylie goes ahead and shuts down rumors that she\u2019s pregnant after teasing a ~surprise~:\n\nJanuary 23, 2019\n\nKylie posts an Instagram pic with the caption \u201cextra\u00f1o a mi esposo,\u201d which means \u201cI miss my husband\u201d in Spanish.\n\nUmm, WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL US, KYLIE.\n\nFebruary 4, 2019\n\nFollowing rumors that Travis planned to propose at the Super Bowl, he shares a photo of Kylie wearing a massive rock on her ring finger.

Travis\u2019s rep shuts down the claims, saying the rapper \u201cstrongly\u201d denies allegations of cheating and that \u201cthe reason he stayed home from his show\u201d was \u201cvery much because of illness.\u201d\n\nMarch 2, 2019\n\nTravis deletes Instagram, reportedly to prove to Kylie that he isn\u2019t DM\u2019ing other girls.\n\nInstagram\n\nApril 30, 2019\n\nCheating rumors?
