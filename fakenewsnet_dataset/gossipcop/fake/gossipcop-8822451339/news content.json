Before Justin Bieber married Hailey Bieber (n\u00e9e Baldwin) in September 2018, the heartthrob singer was romantically linked to some of Hollywood\u2019s hottest stars.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be with somebody if I wasn\u2019t in love,\u201d the \u201cPeaches\u201d singer told New! magazine of then-girlfriend Selena Gomez in October 2011. \u201cShe makes me laugh and she puts up with my practical jokes. She has really strong family values as well. We were both raised by our moms in single-parent households, and that\u2019s given us a lot of the same family values in life.\u201d\n\nThe duo made their red carpet debut in February 2011 and continued dating on and off until 2018 \u2014 with their fair share of drama in between. During a break in their romance in August 2016, Gomez threw shade at the Canada native via Instagram after he asked fans to stop hating on Sofia Richie, who he was seeing at the time.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t handle the hate then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol \u2013 it should be special between you two only. Don\u2019t be mad at your fans. They love you,\u201d the Wizards of Waverly Place alum wrote at the time.\n\nJustin replied: \u201cIt\u2019s funny to see people that used me for attention are still trying to point the finger this way. Sad. All love. I\u2019m not one for anyone receiving hate.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cLose You to Love Me\u201d singer got the last word, writing, \u201cFunny how the ones that cheated multiple times, are pointing the finger at the ones that were forgiving and supportive, no wonder fans are mad. Sad. All love.\u201d\n\nAfter the pair split for good in May 2018, the \u201cSorry\u201d musician began hooking up with Hailey again following their initial 2015 fling. Just two months later, Justin proposed, and they exchanged vows at a New York City courthouse in September 2018. A second wedding ceremony was held in South Carolina one year later.\n\nDue to the short amount of time between his breakup with Gomez and his marriage to Hailey, some fans have speculated that Justin cheated on the \u201cWolves\u201d singer with the model. However, Hailey set the record straight once and for all in September 2022.\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
