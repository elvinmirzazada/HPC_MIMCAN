According to sources, the children are \"much happier\" to be living closer to their dad.\n\nAn insider told Hollywood Life: \"[Angelina Jolie and the children] had spent their spring and part of the summer in Malibu, about an hour drive from Brad, which was hard on the kids. While they liked being at the beach, despite everything, they did not like being so far from dad. Now that they are skateboarding distance to Dad's house, they are much happier being close to him, and back in the neighbourhood they consider home \u2014 about a mile from Dad.\"\n\nGALLERY: See the photos of Angelina Jolie's new home\n\nAngelina has moved into a six-bedroom mansion\n\nAngelina's new mansion is an incredible 11,000 square feet, and has an outdoor swimming pool with a pool house, a home gym and library as well as huge landscaped gardens.

Now I know what it means, by feeling it. It means to love without ownership. It means expecting nothing in return. It doesn't mean [expletive] all to me until, you know. Until you live it\u2026 I worry about it more for my kids, being subjected to it, and their friends getting ideas from it. And of course it's not done with any kind of delicacy or insight \u2013 it's done to sell.\"", "images": ["https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/fe939650ed3a-angelina-jolie-1-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/92e4a5aac89a-gettyimages-1179309601.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/26efd351e14e-gettyimages-855610756.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0a625ae90a2a-emmy-griffiths-hello-magazine.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/30fcd0addbe6-5-angelina-jolie-mansion-a.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/fe939650ed3a-angelina-jolie-1-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0bdf9910ddf8-ange-1-z.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b47593392752-katya-jones-close-up.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0f88fbafcd04-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5ada9e9c8d7f-angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-2014-oscars.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/e6a8777cf9b7-gettyimages-1395628191.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/614415272586-gettyimages-1067681148.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/83ba5637e9e9-david-muir-glimpse-parents-t.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/fe939650ed3a-angelina-jolie-1-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emmy Griffiths", "Tv", "Film Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2017070740458/angelina-jolie-family-mansion-brad-pitt/", "title": "Angelina Jolie moves family closer to Brad Pitt after divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "title": "Angelina Jolie moves family closer to Brad Pitt | HELLO!", "description": "Angelina Jolie moves family closer to Brad Pitt in Hollywood following their divorce.
