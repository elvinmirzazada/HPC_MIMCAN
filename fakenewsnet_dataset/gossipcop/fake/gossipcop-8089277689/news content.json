I understand they were going through some things, but if it's family, you're not going to miss a wedding,\" he says. \"I gotta state my truth.\"\n\n\"You just start coming up with all types of crazy things in your head,\" Kanye adds, noting that he started to feel \"like the cousin that you can't bring around.\"\n\nWhen asked if he knows why JAY-Z and Beyonce skipped the nuptials, Kanye says he never asked them. \"I'm not sure, I'm past it, but at the time I was hurt about it,\" he replies. \"I don't think I ever asked him that question directly.\"\n\nAs for the state of his friendship with JAY today, Kanye says, \"We good. We texting each other, positive energy.\"\n\nCharlamagne also inquired as to whether the Watch the Throne collaborators have seen each other, to which Kanye admits, \"I haven't seen him, but I can feel him.\"\n\nHe adds, \"We'll do it. Sometimes also when you have such similar personalities ...they need to do it on our own.\"\n\nKanye also addresses JAY-Z's slight dig about him in the song, \"Kill JAY-Z,\" but doesn't seem mad about it. \"He did it in a brotherly way,\" he notes. \"He could have done a record, it was a bar.\"\n\n\n\nThe father of three also tends to call out those close to him and those in the industry in both his songs and tweets. He's recently been back in the news, thanks to his spirited, albeit controversial, return to Twitter.
