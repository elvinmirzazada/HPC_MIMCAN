Fans are speculating that Beyonc\u00e9 might be pregnant again.\n\nRelated: Beyonce\u2019s Best Instagram Style There's never a moment when Queen Bey doesn't look flawless\u2014and that's especially true on her Instagram account! That's where the pop princess gives her fans a peek at her sometimes private, but oh-so-chic street style moments, from a Chanel-pinned Canadian tuxedo to her countless crop tops. (Those abs!) Flip through to see all of Beyonce's most memorable 'Gram styles.\n\nThe 22-time Grammy winner, 36, appeared to have a bit of a bump while performing in Rome on Sunday, July 8, as part of her On the Run II stadium tour with her husband, Jay-Z. Concertgoers shared videos of Beyonc\u00e9 dancing on stage to \u201c\u201803 Bonnie & Clyde\u201d in a formfitting silver minidress. At the end of the song, she rubbed her stomach and smiled at the audience before walking away.\n\nThe couple already share daughter Blue Ivy, 6, and twins Rumi and Sir, 12 months.\n\n\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 is really pregnant again.. and she\u2019s about to be a mother of 4 WOW,\u201d one Twitter user speculated. Another fan quipped, \u201cSHE\u2019S CREATING THE NEXT DESTINY\u2019S CHILD BEFORE OUR EYES.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Parents Who Have Twins From Neil Patrick Harris to Angelina Jolie and now Beyonce, scroll down to see more stars who are mom and dad to twin kids\n\nSome members of the Beyhive argued that the speculation may not be totally far-fetched. They pointed out that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s favorite number is four, which could mean that they\u2019d love to welcome a fourth child. After all, Queen Bey was born on September 4 and Hov\u2019s birthday is December 4; they married on April 4, 2008; and Blue Ivy\u2019s middle name comes from the roman numeral IV. In addition, Beyonc\u00e9 released an album titled 4 in 2011 and Jay-Z dropped a record titled 4:44 in 2017.\n\nOther fans were quick to laugh off the pregnancy rumors, though. \u201cI\u2019m going to believe that this is a food baby and she just dancing sexy,\u201d one person tweeted. Another wrote, \u201cShe aint pregnant she had twins its hard for her body to snap back.\u201d\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z recently announced that they are set to headline the Global Citizen Festival in South Africa in December. It is unlikely that she is expecting as she would be in the final months of her pregnancy at that time. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises pregnant women not to travel to South Africa due to the risk of malaria.\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
