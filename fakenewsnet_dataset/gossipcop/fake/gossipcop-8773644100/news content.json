I don't think it's smart to watch another person give birth when you're pregnant, LOL,\" Khloe added.\n\nIn her blog post on Monday, the 33-year-old reality star -- who is expected to welcome her first child with Tristan Thompson in Cleveland, Ohio, any day now -- insisted that watching her sisters go through labor has removed her fear when it comes time to give birth herself.\n\n\"I've seen over eight births live and in person. Women were made to do this!\u201d Khloe said. \u201cI read my apps every day and I ask my doctor if I have any questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I'm a little nervous to go into labor, but I'm trying to not overthink something that literally happens all the time,\u201d she expressed.\n\nAccording to her sister, Kim Kardashian West, however, Khloe is pretty \"freaked out\" about becoming a first-time mom. In a recent interview with ET, Kim said she was the \"real one\" with Khloe about how everything's \"going to go down.\"\n\n\"You cannot tell her anything right now that's too sensitive because she's just so freaked out. So, I can't really get into the whole, like, nipples and breastfeeding thing,\" she quipped. \"She's just going to have to figure that all out and slowly.\"\n\n\"It'll be fine. She knows,\" Kim noted. \"She's seen all of us go through it. She's prepared, but I feel her and I are on a really good communication about everything. I know when to push it and when to... right now isn't a time to freak her out. The closer it gets, you can't freak someone out.\"\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2Fkhloekardashian_1280.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2Fet_040818_krisjennervidpic.png%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-03/khloe_kardashian_gettyimages-513509684_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2Fet_prep_khloe_welcomes_baby_040918_updated.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/et_prep_khloe_welcomes_baby_040918_updated.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2Fet_prep_khloe_welcomes_baby_040918_updated.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/et_prep_khloe_welcomes_baby_040918_updated.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-recalls-being-in-delivery-room-when-kylie-jenner-gave-birth-100057", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Recalls Being in Delivery Room When Kylie Jenner Gave Birth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/et_prep_khloe_welcomes_baby_040918_updated.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The Good American designer says she doesn't think 'it's smart to watch another person give birth when you're pregnant.'", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Recalls Being in Delivery Room When Kylie Jenner Gave Birth", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-recalls-being-in-delivery-room-when-kylie-jenner-gave-birth-100057", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The Good American designer says she doesn't think 'it's smart to watch another person give birth when you're pregnant.'", "twitter": {"description": "The Good American designer says she doesn't think 'it's smart to watch another person give birth when you're pregnant.'", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Recalls Being in Delivery Room When Kylie Jenner Gave Birth", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-recalls-being-in-delivery-room-when-kylie-jenner-gave-birth-100057", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/et_prep_khloe_welcomes_baby_040918_updated.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Khloe Kardashian Recalls Being in Delivery Room When Kylie Jenner Gave Birth | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Khloe Kardashian, Babies & Kids, Pregnancies", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
