{"url": "www.glamour.com/story/fans-think-kylie-jenner-already-had-her-baby", "text": "Just when you think literally no stone has been left unturned when it comes to Kylie Jenner's reported pregnancy, another headline or five emerges. Today's, featuring a theory from her fans that's made some serious waves since it broke, is a big one. According to Twitter, Kylie hasn't been MIA lately because she's hiding a baby bump\u2014instead, fans believe she's been keeping out of the spotlight because she already had the baby. (Yep, you read that right.)\n\nOf course, let's remember that Kylie in no way is obligated to give us an explanation: It's completely up to her if and when she's comfortable sharing her own news. But Kylie is a public figure, and Twitter exists. Remember how on Monday everyone was super bummed when the Kardashian family's Christmas card did not, as many hoped, confirm Jenner's rumored pregnancy? And then some very dedicated fans unearthed a couple blurry photos that appear to show her with a baby bump\u2014dated from all the way back to September?\n\nNow twitterers are saying that, based on the size of her supposed bump in those photos from three months ago (which, BTW, is in no way \"proof\" of anything), the youngest Kardashian-Jenner sister must have had her baby by now. Another, auxiliary, theory: Jenner is for sure going to announce the birth on New Year's Eve, so we won't have to wait too much longer. And there's yet another theory about the Christmas card reveal.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4659cf1f875831ecb18fc3/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Kylie-Jenner.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/650b3f8a7e0240c5407e69b1/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4659cf1f875831ecb18fc3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kylie-Jenner.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/64cd37f7f2d4984422dd4ba1/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/629e612c262951ee64878243/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6560c8d02d5583aeecb7d705/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/651195dc79e6857eeb0bf83c/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/654e6c3c6ef1cd5962611ae6/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/65159927af8cae32202cbfc6/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4659cf1f875831ecb18fc3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kylie-Jenner.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Ashley Edwards Walker"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/fans-think-kylie-jenner-already-had-her-baby", "title": "Fans Think Kylie Jenner Already Had Her Baby", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Fans on Twitter have unearthed a photo of Kylie Jenner's reported baby bump from September, making some think she's already had the baby.", "id": "5a464389c155cc26e2d93435", "keywords": "kylie jenner", "news_keywords": "kylie jenner", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a464389c155cc26e2d93435", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Fans on Twitter have unearthed a photo of Kylie Jenner's reported baby bump from September, making some think she's already had the baby.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4659cf1f875831ecb18fc3/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Kylie-Jenner.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4659cf1f875831ecb18fc3/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Kylie-Jenner.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Fans also think they know when she'll announce it.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4659cf1f875831ecb18fc3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kylie-Jenner.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Here's Why Fans Think That Kylie Jenner Already Had Her Baby", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/fans-think-kylie-jenner-already-had-her-baby"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-12-29T16:02:10.566Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-29T16:02:10.566Z", "author": "Ashley Edwards Walker"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Fans also think they know when she'll announce it.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4659cf1f875831ecb18fc3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kylie-Jenner.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Here's Why Fans Think That Kylie Jenner Already Had Her Baby"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4659cf1f875831ecb18fc3/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/Kylie-Jenner.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514563330.566, "source": "http://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
