EEEEEEK!!!!\n\n(Getty)\n\nThat\u2019s better, don\u2019t you think?\n\nBut even though one month is a very small period of time until the Royal Wedding bells ring, those close to Markle reportedly think it\u2019s not small enough.\n\nThey wish the wedding were taking place tomorrow.\n\nBecause then they\u2019d only have 24 hour left to deal what one source is describing as the ultimate Bridezilla.\n\nYes, this source is looking at you, Meghan Markle.\n\n\u201cMeghan\u2019s driving everyone crazy with her diva demands,\u201d an insider tells Life & Style, adding of the bride-to-be:\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a perfectionist, and she\u2019s trying to control everything going on around her.\u201d\n\n(Getty)\n\nThis is the first time we\u2019ve heard of Markle being described as basically anything other than kind, generous, loyal, lovely and loving.\n\nAside from those racist trolls who gave Meghan and Harry problems early on in their romance due to the former\u2019s mixed heritage, Markle has received nothing but positive reviews for over a year now.\n\nEveryone seems to adore her!\n\nBut weddings do have a way of causing such stress and tension for those prominently involved that it\u2019s nearly impossible not to snap on occasion.\n\nAnd those are just regular weddings; with, like 75 to 100 guests.\n\nMarkle and Harry will be getting married in front of thousands of people lining the London streets, as well as millions more watching from home.\n\n(Getty)\n\nAccording to this tabloid source, the former Suits actress feels a lot of pressure to follow \u201cthe rules of royal etiquette\u201d on her big day, but is also \u201cworried about her family being on their best behavior.\u201d\n\nThis last part is a bit unusual, however, because we\u2019re under the impression that almost no one from Markle\u2019s family is invited.\n\nJust last week, Markle\u2019s controversial half-sister spoke out and complained about her lack of a wedding invite.\n\n\"Humanitarians move forward with love and kindness especially to Family,\" Samanha Grant Tweeted about her snub, attempting to shame Markle into extending the invite.\n\nSo far, though, it has failed to work.\n\n(Getty)\n\nIt is expected that Markle\u2019s parents will be in attendance, with her mom actually walking her down the aisle instead of her dad.\n\nThis is because Thomas Markle is famously shy.\n\nHe and Meghan\u2019s mother split a long time ago and Thomas now lives a very quiet life in Mexico. Sources have told The Sun that he\u2019s afraid to face the \"world\u2019s glare\" on May 19.\n\nBut face it he will, at least in some capacity.\n\nJust like those complaining about Markle\u2019s recent behavior, we\u2019re guessing Thomas will be happy when the wedding day comes and then goes.\n\nWhat about YOU?\n\nAre you sick of all this Royal coverage?\n\nOr do you wish there was even more of it?", "images": ["http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/meghan-markle-says-hello-629x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/04/meghan-and-the-prince-scaled.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/04/kimye-selfie-time-320x240.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1243355194-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1128_toddchrisley_header-80x80.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/04/meghan-and-the-prince-720x540.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-13-at-11.16.27-AM-80x80.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20540'%3E%3Crect%20width='720'%20height='540'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1053032052-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-28-at-2.06.40-PM-80x80.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20821%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='821'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3Crect%20width='320'%20height='240'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1189300424-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/77b580ad8360b51fd13b346a7821635b-copy-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/harry-and-megan-727x1024.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/04/meghan-and-the-prince-683x1024.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20727%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='727'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20683%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='683'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20629%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='629'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-26-at-1.00.52-PM-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/04/surprising-royal-821x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/04/meghan-and-the-prince-scaled.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kay Rhodes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/04/meghan-markle-is-a-total-bridezilla-report/", "title": "Meghan Markle is a Total Bridezilla: Report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle is a Total Bridezilla: Report", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are getting married one month from today.
