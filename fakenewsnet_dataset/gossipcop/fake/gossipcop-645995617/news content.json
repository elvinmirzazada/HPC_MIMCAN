The New York-born rap star and his wife Beyonce welcomed twins babies into the world in June, and Jay reportedly isn't allowing Kanye's decision to quit his streaming service Tidal to distract him from his responsibilities as a parent.\n\nA source explained: \"Jay-Z has all his attention on being a father, being a husband, and watching the success of his new album flourish. READ: Kanye West quits Tidal over money dispute \"All Kanye is to him right now is like dealing with a pesky fly that flies into your food. It's flying around and you just want to get away from it and enjoy your meal.\" One of the last pictures Jay-Z and Kanye West have taken together after the 2016 MTV VMAs. Picture: Instagram\n\nJay, 47, released his long-awaited '4:44' album on June 30 and he addresses their strained relationship on the record 'Kill Jay Z'. But he isn't overly concerned by Kanye's decision to quit Tidal and is instead happy for his lawyers to resolve the situation. The insider told HollywoodLife.com: \"This latest decree or whatever it is that Kanye wants to leave Tidal will all be sorted out by lawyers.\n\nREAD: Nas hails Jay-Z's 4:44 album \"Jay will avoid all nonsense that Kanye often brings, and will not listing to his whining. Jay has more important things to worry about.\" Kanye's decision to walk away from Tidal comes shortly after a source claimed that Jay and Beyonce - who also have a five-year-old daughter named Blue Ivy - \"have never been happier\". Although the arrival of their twins has left the celebrity duo feeling \"totally exhausted\", Beyonce and Jay are both still overjoyed.", "images": ["http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/market-indicators.1ce7978a.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/app-store.ae2ce25f.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/instagram-wht.08ed7500.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/bookmark-ico.18d10d1f.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/youtube-wht.adef66e4.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/google-play.089d2f5e.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/facebook-wht.f4d5995e.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/linkedin-share.d5cb256c.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/whatsapp-share.806f38a2.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/facebook-menu.c7066622.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/iol-logo.40c43eee.svg", "https://image-prod.iol.co.za/resize/650x366/In-this-April-30-2017-file-photo-Beyonce-and-Jay-Z-watch-during-the-first-half-in-Game-7-of-an-NBA-basketball-first-round-playoff-series-between-the-Los-Angeles-Clippers-and-the-Utah-Jazz-in-Los-Angeles-Picture-AP?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/b8c871ac-7585-593d-a5a5-5de6d1cf8350&operation=CROP&offset=0x236&resize=3063x1723", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/notifications-ico.c9e00972.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/menu-ico.f625b888.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/copy-link-share.9f958957.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/linkedin-menu.47f111b7.svg", "https://image-prod.iol.co.za/resize/420x42000/?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/b5335902-925a-5c40-b5dd-7fcc9c69757b&operation=CROP&offset=0x0&resize=780x607", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/rss-wht.74af5e36.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/search-ico.c1a8f28e.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/youtube-menu.abf84417.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/close-btn.323b7e3b.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/search-input-wht-ico.944fa476.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/arrow-left-ltgrey.bcbc5029.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/weather.fe15771a.svg", "https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/800/In-this-April-30-2017-file-photo-Beyonce-and-Jay-Z-watch-during-the-first-half-in-Game-7-of-an-NBA-basketball-first-round-playoff-series-between-the-Los-Angeles-Clippers-and-the-Utah-Jazz-in-Los-Angeles-Picture-AP?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/b8c871ac-7585-593d-a5a5-5de6d1cf8350", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/telegram-share.698faf55.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/rss-menu.4b09e376.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/iol.86757031.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2127685057428118&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/instagram-menu.d13fec85.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/x.d9c40b69.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/facebook-share.92bfe06f.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/iol-wht.8eeb2d01.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/x-wht.e3a5a15f.svg", "http://www.iol.co.za/static/media/facebook.87210d65.svg"], "top_img": "https://image-prod.iol.co.za/resize/650x366/In-this-April-30-2017-file-photo-Beyonce-and-Jay-Z-watch-during-the-first-half-in-Game-7-of-an-NBA-basketball-first-round-playoff-series-between-the-Los-Angeles-Clippers-and-the-Utah-Jazz-in-Los-Angeles-Picture-AP?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/b8c871ac-7585-593d-a5a5-5de6d1cf8350&operation=CROP&offset=0x236&resize=3063x1723", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bang Showbiz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/jay-z-views-kanye-west-as-a-pesky-fly-10109891", "title": "Jay-Z views Kanye West as a 'pesky fly'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "5A0910AA1A12E32A5352933CF5FD96E9", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "iQCzO2whcLNU6_F3xi1Dck7JMALz7869mBLTQf08wJo", "fb": {"pages": 21993963624, "app_id": 293175074032541}, "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jay-Z views Kanye West as a 'pesky fly'", "description": "Rap legend Jay-Z is focused on his family's welfare -
