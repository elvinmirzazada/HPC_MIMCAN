When I was sick with breast cancer, he was the first to call. He helps and helped in ways that \u2026 you know, he was incredible in that way.\u201d\n\nThough Kotb has fond memories of Lauer, 60, she isn\u2019t discounting the stories of the women who came forward and accused the previous NBC anchor of sexual misconduct.\n\n\u201cThere is that Matt and then there\u2019s the Matt that the accusers speak of. And those accusers\u2019 voices matter and that story matters and it\u2019s \u2026 (to Savannah Guthrie) It\u2019s still tough, right?\u201d Kotb said in the THR interview to Guthrie, who affirmed: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been five months since Lauer parted ways with the show at the end of November after the network received a \u201cdetailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,\u201d with reason to believe \u201cthis may not have been an isolated incident.\u201d Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nFollowing his firing, which was announced live on Today by Guthrie and Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,\u201d he said, in part. \u201cTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE following Lauer\u2019s exit, Guthrie, 46, and Kotb opened up about sharing the sobering news with the world.\n\n\u201cI think you could see from the moment that the news happened that our hearts were broken, and in lots of ways, they still are,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cThat feeling was shared through our whole newsroom and our whole Today show staff, because it sounds like clich\u00e9 or a promo line, but it happens to be true: We are family, and we do love each other, and families do go through hard times, and when that happens in good families, you just get closer. You pull together and you focus on the foundation and what keeps you together. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve all been trying to do. And for me, I just am trying to get comfortable with how complicated the feelings around all of it are, and it is complicated. And just trying to have love and compassion for everyone concerned.\u201d\n\nTyler Essary/Getty\n\nThe duo also spoke about Lauer, whom they are continuing to support and only want the best for.\n\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s working on his family, we know that for sure. Of course our hearts go out to the brave women who have told their stories,\u201d Guthrie said.\n\n\u201cWhat we are experiencing and processing now is how to honor and remain a true friend to someone even in spite of learning things that are deeply disturbing,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd we are trying to navigate that path with integrity.\u201d", "images":
