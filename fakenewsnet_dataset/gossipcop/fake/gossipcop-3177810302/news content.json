Holley was gunning for the judge to get her clients dismissed from the case, and the judge saw her point.\n\nThe best part ... the judge reacted to Chyna's claim that E! dropped \"Rob & Chyna\" because the Kardashians painted her as a bad mother. The judge confessed he didn't watch the show, but said it's hard to imagine E! wouldn't do a show where the woman is a bad mother!\n\nThe judge scoffed at Chyna's claim that the Kardashians interfered with her E! contract, saying Chyna was only in negotiations with the network and didn't have an enforceable contract.\n\nIn the end, the judge bought the argument that Kim and Kris did not interfere with Chyna's contract with E!, but did give Chyna the right to a second bite of the apple where she could try and create a new case against the 2 women.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/1a/16by9/2017/12/27/1a74a0b9f70251f5a8048d1c350f3d60_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/85/4by3/2023/11/28/85299c59a419494c866f9d7f7afaaca7_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/aa/4by3/2023/11/28/aaf21212f28d46209aaa8ec790f835a7_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/39/4by3/2023/11/28/390b233d1e924975a1e5a1f05a29953b_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/33/4by3/2023/11/28/33a341607d6a41e1ae52ed39af932768_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/45/16by9/2023/11/28/45438662648f46ffbfebf301a40f4f09_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/14/4by3/2023/11/28/1482c046cfc04610b0546e0ba5ea8b4d_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/6c/4by3/2023/11/29/6c2a3b45ec684d769dadf8c117d2a7ea_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/29/16by9/2023/11/28/29d403855ca4449eb50fcdb7cbba6f62_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/db/4by3/2023/11/28/dba399b3df2b4e4abc5bab424843dbfc_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/7e/16by9/2023/11/28/7e6829b0675f491bb105dc457c107fad_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/56/4by3/2023/11/28/5685edfc344b4d12a042649930d0c439_md.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/ab/16by9/2018/01/18/ab21e7beec2a50acba4eeab1d21ffcdc_xl.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/5e/o/2018/01/18/5ea69444c4e959a7a2d4b71501e3fc05_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/dc/4by3/2023/11/28/dc35f957aad2483d8360ab6d7fed6fb4_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/45/4by3/2023/11/28/45438662648f46ffbfebf301a40f4f09_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/df/4by3/2023/11/28/df695469b843407f99a6969bf331d35a_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/fc/4by3/2023/11/06/fc495e2b7c124f7096078a54da4d554f_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/de/4by3/2023/11/28/de840a574ccd433ebb7cfabbde8bfcc0_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/98/4by3/2023/11/28/981c338dfd4d4f1480713af0d99594d7_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/1f/16by9/2023/11/28/1fe1f731eb2b43349563899cebf6693d_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/39/16by9/2023/11/28/390b233d1e924975a1e5a1f05a29953b_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/02/4by3/2023/11/28/029b12ad1e5d41948f96a752511057c1_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e2/16by9/2017/11/22/e2396fd65fea584ca42cf471e0794c41_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/1c/o/2016/08/15/1c7a4a421277593383ac9317fde83d73_md.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/ab/16by9/2018/01/18/ab21e7beec2a50acba4eeab1d21ffcdc_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/01/18/kim-kardashian-kris-jenner-rob-and-blac-chyna-reality-show-court/", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner Win Big Victory in Blac Chyna's E!
