Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Markle said: \u201cI\u2019m really hurt that she\u2019s cut me off completely. \u201cI used to have a phone number and text number for her personal aides at the Palace, but after I said a few critical words about the Royal Family changing Meghan, they cut me off.\u201d He expressed his sadness over the fact he has no means of sending his daughter a card ahead of her birthday on August 4, stating that if he sent one to Kensington Palace it would just be \u201cone among thousands\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m really hurt that she\u2019s cut me off completely Thomas Markle\n\nHe added that he will likely not be able to see his grandchild should Meghan and Harry have children in the imminent future. Expressing his anguish, he told the paper: \u201cHow tragic is that, to deprive a child of its grandfather because I said a few things critical of the Royal Family.\u201d Mr Markle came under sharp criticism after it was revealed he was paid for a set of staged paparazzi photographs ahead of the Royal wedding in May. But he expressed his confusion after receiving contradicting advice on what to do in response to the scandal.\n\nMr Markle expressed his sadness that he may not be able to see his potential future grandchildren\n\nMeghan Markle kisses Prince Harry at polo match\n\nBecome an Express Premium member Support fearless journalism\n\nSupport fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online, advert free\n\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-day\n\nFREE trial\n\nHe noted that a Royal aide had said the photos had \u201coffended the Royal Family\u201d and called on him to offer an apology. Prince Harry then reportedly contradicted this statement, noting it was \u201cunnecessary\u201d to issue an apology as it would only \u201cdrag the story out a few more days\u201d. While noting that Meghan is still \u201ceverything\u201d to him, he stated he had \u201cjust about reached his limit\u201d with his daughter and the Royal Family. In a stark warning, he said: \u201cThey want me to be silent, they want me to just go away. But I won't be silenced.\u201d He criticised Meghan for her \u201csense of superiority\u201d, and noted he had helped make her into the \u201cDuchess she is today\u201d.\n\nThe Royal Family was reportedly 'offended' after Mr Markle staged a series of paparazzi photos", "images": ["https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/183x122/1839287_1.jpg",
