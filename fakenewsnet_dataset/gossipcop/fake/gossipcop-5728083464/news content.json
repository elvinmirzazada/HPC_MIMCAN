And although the couple has denied the affair, Sean\u2019s ex-girlfriend Ariana Grande is not too convinced. \u201cAriana is not surprised at all that Sean may have been cheating on Jhene with Nicole. Ariana found Sean selfish, narcissistic and self-absorbed while they were dating. Ariana felt like Sean needed a lot of attention from not just her, but from other women too,\u201d a source close to Ariana tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Ouch!\n\n\u201cSo, Ariana believes that Sean would be at least flirting with Nicole, if not more, while still in a relationship with Jhene because that is what he did with her too. Ariana believes the rumors about Sean and Nicole, which makes Ariana feel bad for both Sean and Jhene because Sean has not changed. She thinks he can be a dog, and he has a lot of maturing to do still,\u201d the source continued. If you recall, Arianna and Sean dated for eight months back in 2014. They seemed like they were in it for the long haul until Ariana got a little too close to Justin Bieber, 24, on stage at one of her concerts in 2015. So, it\u2019s clear there was drama on both sides.\n\nDespite, Ariana\u2019s concerns, we do have reason to believe Big Sean has changed. The \u201cBounce Back\u201d rapper responded to a fan\u2019s savage comment regarding his alleged infidelity with, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not true at all. Y\u2019all wasted no time though telling me how much I ain\u2019t s**t tho with no doubt in your mind\u2026 cause the internet said so? Thanks for the support. But truly it\u2019s all love only, I have no time to hate or judge anybody!\u201d It looks like he\u2019s taking his relationship with Jhene very seriously, and we couldn\u2019t be happier!", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ariana-grande-big-sean-ftr.jpg?quality=100&w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/jhene-aiko-big-sean-baby-noah-mega-1.jpg?quality=100&w=329", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ariana-grande-big-sean-ftr.jpg?quality=100", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/jhene-aiko-big-sean-baby-noah-mega-2.jpg?quality=100&w=335", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rexfeatures_9330772h.jpg?quality=100&w=369"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ariana-grande-big-sean-ftr.jpg?quality=100", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robyn Merrett"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/13/ariana-grande-big-sean-cheating-rumors-jhene-aiko/", "title": "Ariana Grande Wasn\u2019t \u2018Surprised\u2019 To Hear Big Sean Cheating Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Ariana Grande reacts to Big Sean's cheating rumors.
