Many fans are convinced that the voice belongs to Jenner \u2014 and that she references the couple's daughter in the lyrics.\n\nBecause the actual words are muffled and difficult to hear clearly, fans have been speculating that Jenner was saying, \"We got bust down Rollies, bust down Pateks / And I told him I wanted to have a bust down baby.\" \"Bust down\" is a colloquial term for \"expensive,\" particularly when it comes to jewelry or watches, like a Rolex.\n\nThe outro lyrics have since been edited twice on the popular lyrics website Genius, and now read, \"And I told him I needed him to bust down our new baby.\"\n\nMay 7, 2018: Jenner and Scott made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala\n\nScott and Jenner at the 2018 Met Gala.
