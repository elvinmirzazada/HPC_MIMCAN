The world has been fascinated by Caitlyn\u2019s story and getting her would push ratings through the roof.\"\n\nWell, they're not wrong there.\n\nCaitlyn is no stranger to reality telly \u2013 she's starred in Keeping Up With The Kardashians since forevs, and even had her own show I Am Cait \u2013 and after proof that the Kardashian/Jenner family feud is still rife, this could be the perfect opportunity for her to set the record straight.\n\nShe even recently revealed that she hasn't spoken to Kim Kardashian in a 'very long time'.\n\n\"I love Kimberly, I think she's a wonderful person,\" Caitlyn said on Australia's Today show.\n\n\"But, well, to be honest with you, I really haven't talked to her in a long time. I've kind of let everything calm down. So I kind of stay, you know, I keep my distance. I'm out there trying to make a difference in the world. There's a lot of drama in the Kardashian family.\"\n\nAnd staying loyal to her momager, Kim didn't hold back during a recent interview with Ellen DeGeneres and even implied that Caitlyn was lying about the things she had said about Kris in her memoir.\n\n\"My heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she\u2019s been through so much and Caitlyn is promoting this book and she\u2019s saying all these things.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary and I just feel like it\u2019s unfair, things aren\u2019t truthful.\"", "images": ["http://heatworld.com/assets/facebook.svg", "https://images.bauerhosting.com/legacy/lifestyle-images/celebrity/591ec1c67f5cbb3b37d23822/caitlyn-jenner.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=undefined&q=80", "https://images.bauerhosting.com/legacy/lifestyle-images/celebrity/591ec1c67f5cbb3b37d23822/caitlyn-jenner.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=1440&q=80", "https://images.bauerhosting.com/legacy/lifestyle-images/celebrity/5915932ef834e7af03a329f1/caitlyn-jenner-this-morning.jpg?auto=format&w=1440&q=80", "http://heatworld.com/assets/twitter.svg", "http://heatworld.com/assets/pinterest.svg"], "top_img": "https://images.bauerhosting.com/legacy/lifestyle-images/celebrity/591ec1c67f5cbb3b37d23822/caitlyn-jenner.jpg?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=undefined&q=80", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hannah Mellin"], "canonical_link": "https://heatworld.com/celebrity/news/caitlyn-jenner-celebrity-big-brother/", "title": "Is CAITLYN JENNER going into Celebrity Big Brother?", "meta_data": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Celebrity Big Brother bosses are apparently willing to 'break the bank' to get Caitlyn Jenner on the show.
