After dropping the baby weight from her pregnancy with North, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star bared her svelte torso in a range of different half-shirts from dazzling high-end pieces [\u2026]\n\nShe then sat front row at the Alexander Wang show on Feb. 14, supporting her aunt Kendall Jenner, who walked in the show. Nori got upset and started crying when she spotted a photographer with a plush monkey toy around his camera lens, but later recovered when he let her play with the toy backstage.\n\nTell Us: What do you think of North\u2019s bulletproof vest?", "images": ["http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/a360media-logo-color.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AmazonIsh.png?crop=35px%2C0px%2C1281px%2C1281px&resize=300%2C300&quality=86&strip=all", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Who-Went-Home-During-Dancing-With-the-Stars-Semifinals.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C1789px%2C1011px&resize=600%2C338&quality=86&strip=all", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady", "Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/north-west-wears-bulletproof-vest-kanye-wests-adidas-pics-2015172/", "title": "North West Wears Bulletproof Vest to Kanye West\u2019s Adidas Show: Pics", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "ahrefs-site-verification": "0c593552a61f5d2f07d12f3629456cc24366510fb83bd76eb9504919faac5af7", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kim Kardashian revealed on Twitter that North West wore a bulletproof vest designed by her father Kanye West at his Adidas show on Feb. 12 -- pics", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "North West Wears Bulletproof Vest to Kanye West's Adidas Show: Pics", "description": "Kim Kardashian revealed on Twitter that North West wore a bulletproof vest designed by her father Kanye West at his Adidas show on Feb. 12 -- pics", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/north-west-wears-bulletproof-vest-kanye-wests-adidas-pics-2015172/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-12-07T06:35:22+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2015-02-17T14:45:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-07T06:35:22+00:00"}, "author": "Rachel McRady", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Yeezy Babywear: North Wears Bulletproof Vest to Kanye West's Adidas Show", "description": "Kim Kardashian revealed on Twitter that North West wore a bulletproof vest designed by her father Kanye West at his Adidas show on Feb. 12 -- pics", "image": "/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.3.2", "sailthru.date": "2015-02-17 09:45:00", "sailthru.title": "North West Wears Bulletproof Vest to Kanye West\u2019s Adidas Show: Pics", "sailthru.tags": ",Celebrity Moms,arts,arts and entertainment,arts and entertainment,business and finance,clothing,consumer goods,culture,economic sector,economy,entertainment and media,entertainment and media,fashion,fashion,fashion,North West,style & fashion,women's clothing,women's fashion,women's outerwear,women's sportswear", "sailthru.author": "Us Weekly Staff", "sailthru.description": "Kim Kardashian revealed on Twitter that North West wore a bulletproof vest designed by her father Kanye West at his Adidas show on Feb. 12 -- pics and details", "sailthru.image.full": "/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "sailthru.image.thumb": "/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "hum": "arts,arts and entertainment,business and finance,clothing,consumer goods,culture,economic sector,economy,entertainment and media,fashion,style & fashion,women's clothing,women's fashion,women's outerwear,women's sportswear", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1424184300.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
