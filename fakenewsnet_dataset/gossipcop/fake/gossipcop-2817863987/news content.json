So I hope he sorts himself out.\"\n\nPaltrow dated Affleck on and off for two years, but says she never expected to end up with him. \"I just think we have a very different sort of value system,\" she said.\n\nNowadays, the blonde-tressed actress is dating Coldplay singer Chris Martin. She broke up with Affleck for good in October 2000, and says she no longer communicates with him.\n\nAn Enduring Grace\n\nPaltrow is back in her hometown of New York after spending some time abroad. It's a busy time for the 31-year-old star, who has taken a challenging new role in the movie Sylvia, about the life of American poet and novelist Sylvia Plath. She is also coping with the loss of her father, producer-director Bruce Paltrow, who passed away last year.\n\nFrom her early stardom in Emma (1996), to her Oscar-winning role in Shakespeare in Love (1998) and her singing debut in Duets (2000), Paltrow has managed to maintain a certain grace while living her adult life in front of the cameras. The scrutiny was ongoing through the breakup of her engagement with Brad Pitt and then, those two years with Affleck.\n\nWhile they were dating, Affleck told Good Morning America that he believed Paltrow's perfect man would be someone like her dad. She said that his perfect woman would be \"any sort of stripper at Scores. Anyone that serves cold beer in a bikini.\"", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/washington-tree-down-main-abc-jt-231128_1701211919476_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/jimmy-carter-4-rt-bb-232811_1701198112004_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/pence-trump3-file-gty-ml-231127_1701110318739_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/wirestory_4d3323728cf2d5f8da36ae0d2fd3994a_1x1_144.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/images/hulu.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/rockefeller-tree-ap-jef-231128_1701183464711_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=132445&page=1", "title": "Paltrow Not Surprised at J.Lo-Affleck Drama", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Gwyneth Paltrow, interview, Diane Sawyer, Ben Affleck, Article, 132445", "copyright": "2023 ABC News", "author": "ABC News", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Paltrow Not Surprised at J.Lo-Affleck Drama", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=132445&page=1", "title": "Paltrow Not Surprised at J.Lo-Affleck Drama", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2006-01-06T23:42:20Z", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,132445", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,132445", "googleplay": "https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=132445&page=1"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "ABC News", "title": "Paltrow Not Surprised at J.Lo-Affleck Drama", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=132445&page=1", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,132445", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,132445", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for ipad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=132445&page=1", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=132445&page=1"}}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
