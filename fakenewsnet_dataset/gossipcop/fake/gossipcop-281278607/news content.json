Federline's comments were made during an interview that aired this week on ITV in the UK, but portions of the conversation were released by the Daily Mail on Aug. 6. The former backup dancer claimed the boys decided not to see their mother for the time being in part due to partially nude photos she shared on Instagram. \"The boys have decided they are not seeing her right now,\" Federline said. \"It's been a few months since they've seen her. They made the decision not to go to her wedding.\" Spears initially responded via Instagram on Aug. 6, writing in her Story, \"It saddens me to hear that my ex-husband has decided to discuss the relationship between me and my children.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxNzMyMDY1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU3NjYyMw@@._V1_SY150_CR7,0,100,150_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODc3N2QxNTQtY2NmYy00N2I0LTg4NzItMWI1YjM5ODg1M2EwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_SY150_CR62,0,100,150_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFjYTA4ODQtNzFlZi00MmUzLWFiODItZTAwNTE5Yzk3YzdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_SY150_CR53,0,100,150_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWVmOTAyMmMtY2U3Yi00MmE3LWE4ZjItMzZmZDc1ZDUwMzJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDA4NzMyOA@@._V1_SY150_SX100_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTEwNDA1NjAtYTQyNy00NDc1LTljM2ItZWQxMGU3NDU5MDg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_SY150_CR25,0,100,150_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNjYmFmYWUtZjk0YS00MDUzLTk5MWYtMzIyOTIwY2NkNzgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_UY1200_CR165,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVjZjFiZDYtNjY1Ny00OWU2LWI4YWItOTM3NjIxMmM2YTg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_SY150_CR25,0,100,150_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDlkZDMwZGUtY2MzMS00MDc3LWE1ZTgtZDgwNGIxYTM0NjE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_SY150_CR25,0,100,150_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/http://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/A1EVAM02EL8SFB:146-1612394-3826045:VWGY71QGZKJ6AJQ9CCHK$uedata=s:%2Frd%2Fuedata%3Fstaticb%26id%3DVWGY71QGZKJ6AJQ9CCHK:0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQzZTk5NmMtOGIwNy00YWZkLWJiNDgtZGY5YTJiMWE3NzNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_SY150_CR25,0,100,150_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNjYmFmYWUtZjk0YS00MDUzLTk5MWYtMzIyOTIwY2NkNzgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_SY150_CR10,0,100,150_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNjYmFmYWUtZjk0YS00MDUzLTk5MWYtMzIyOTIwY2NkNzgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_UY98_CR5,0,67,98_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6034961&cj=1&cs_ucfr=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMTUyNjI4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk4NjkzNw@@._V1_SY150_CR0,0,100,150_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5YTI0OGQtN2M3Mi00MzBjLTg2MzMtNmJiNzk0NmI4ZTkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_SY150_CR25,0,100,150_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQ5OWM1NTYtY2ExNy00NmRiLWI3MDctNmVkY2E0ZmEzMDk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_SY150_CR83,0,100,150_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDgzZWUxNGItOWU1Yy00ZjVhLWFiZDgtMDE0YTUxOTU0ZDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_SY150_CR25,0,100,150_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/http://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/A1EVAM02EL8SFB:146-1612394-3826045:VWGY71QGZKJ6AJQ9CCHK$uedata=s:%2Frd%2Fuedata%3Fnoscript%26id%3DVWGY71QGZKJ6AJQ9CCHK:0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2EyZjBhMDgtYTA5MC00NGFhLTlhMjUtMDViZjc0ZjdiZjQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY5NDgzNjQ@._V1_SY150_SX100_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJmNjgxMDQtYjc4Yi00NDA5LTkxNzgtNjRiZTZhNGRhYjZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE0MzQwMjgz._V1_SY150_SX100_AL_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/sash/9FayPGLPcrscMjU.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220815023425im_/https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmNjYmFmYWUtZjk0YS00MDUzLTk5MWYtMzIyOTIwY2NkNzgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_UY1200_CR165,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shannon Sullivan", "Corey Atad", "Nancy Dillon", "Sabienna Bowman", "Eden Arielle Gordon", "Tom\u00e1s Mier", "Max Evry", "A.E.
