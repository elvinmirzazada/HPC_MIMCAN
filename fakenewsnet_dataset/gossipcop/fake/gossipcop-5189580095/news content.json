Kennedy Jr. secretly met Princess Diana in New York, and ever since, there has been much speculation over exactly what happened in her suite at the Carlyle Hotel that day.\n\nAccording to RoseMarie Terenzio, JFK Jr.\u2019s executive assistant who accompanied him to the hotel that day, the hour and half-long meeting in Diana\u2019s suite was way more innocent than those rumors would have you believe, People reports.\n\nThe two simply talked about Diana appearing on the cover of JFK Jr.\u2019s political magazine George, but organizing the meeting wasn\u2019t easy at all.\n\n\u201cI remember him saying, \u2018There\u2019s no way someone is not going to leak it. There\u2019s going to be paparazzi everywhere,\u2019\u201d Terenzio said. \u201cSomeone suggested he go in disguise and I said, \u2018That\u2019s ridiculous. You\u2019re not doing that!\u2019\u201d\n\nPrincess Diana leaving the Carlyle Hotel in New York in 1995. Getty Images\n\nThankfully JFK Jr. agreed, and he and Terenzio figured out the best way to get into the Carlyle unnoticed.\n\n\u201cI had remembered that the last time I had been to the Carlyle for an event, there had been no photographers at the front entrance,\u201d Terenzio told People. \u201cSo I told John, \u2018Don\u2019t go in the side entrance, because if anyone does leak it beforehand, people will expect you to go in the side. So walk in the front door.\u2019\u201d\n\nTurns out Terenzio was right and the two celebrities walked straight into the hotel while the photographers were camped out at the side door.\n\nEven though JFK Jr. had a \u201crespectful piece\u201d in mind, according to Terenzio, the story never ended up happening.\n\n\u201cShe wrote John a note that said, \u2018Thank you so much, but not right now,'\u201d Terenzio recalls.\n\nAfter the meeting, JFK Jr. \"was very careful what he said,\" George magazine creative director Matt Berman told People. \u201cThe one funny thing he said was, \u2018She\u2019s got a great pair of legs.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile he might not have mentioned that to his assistant, \u201cI do remember him saying, \u2018She\u2019s really tall!\u2019\u201d Terenzio says. \u201cHe also said she was very shy. He was surprised how demure she was. I think they had both met Mother Theresa so they spoke about that. And he said how lovely she was.\u201d", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/17/23/768x384/landscape-1496959613-princess-diana.jpg?resize=300:*",
