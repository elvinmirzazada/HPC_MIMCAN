They have issues just like any other couple.\"\n\nThe pair started dating in 2010 and had been on and off until 2015. They reconnected late last year and have kept their relationship very private, as Selena continues to put her health issues and personal needs first. The 25-year-old \"Wolves\" singer suffers from lupus and underwent a kidney transplant last year.\n\n\"She's still working hard, looking after her health, and doing what's good for her,\" the source notes. \"Justin isn't walking all over her.\"\n\nET previously reported that Gomez\u2019s friends and family, particularly her mother, Mandy Teefey, struggled with the couple\u2019s reunion, given the pair\u2019s ups and downs in the past. According to the source, that conflict continues to play a part in her relationship with Bieber.\n\n\"It's not easy for Selena to be stuck in the middle,\u201d the source says. \"Her family not liking him is the biggest issue -- but if they can get through that or if her family changes their tune, things will be a lot smoother.\"\n\nDespite the drama, the singer publicly acknowledged her rekindled romance with Bieber for the first time last week on his 24th birthday. \"March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom,\" Gomez wrote alongside a picture of her laughing with a Polaroid of Bieber on her forehead.\n\nSee more on the pair\u2019s reconciliation in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/selena_justin.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2Fgettyimages-827672180.jpg%3Fh%3D0cf088dd&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2Fselena_justin.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2023-11/GettyImages-1768304587.jpg?h=19de9ceb&width=640", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2Fselena_justin.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2Fgettyimages-917851058.jpg%3Fh%3De198be19&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/selena_justin.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomez-and-justin-bieber-not-broken-up-but-simply-apart-source-says-exclusive-97928", "title": "Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber Not 'Broken Up' But Working on 'Issues' Source Says (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/selena_justin.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Despite rumors of a split, the pair are simply spending time on separate coasts, though a source tells ET that they\u2019re still working through issues \u201cjust like any other couple.\u201d", "title": "Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber Not 'Broken Up' But Working on 'Issues' Source Says (Exclusive)", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomez-and-justin-bieber-not-broken-up-but-simply-apart-source-says-exclusive-97928", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Despite rumors of a split, the pair are simply spending time on separate coasts, though a source tells ET that they\u2019re still working through issues \u201cjust like any other couple.\u201d", "twitter": {"description": "Despite rumors of a split, the pair are simply spending time on separate coasts, though a source tells ET that they\u2019re still working through issues \u201cjust like any other couple.\u201d", "title": "Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber Not 'Broken Up' But Working on 'Issues' Source Says (Exclusive)", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomez-and-justin-bieber-not-broken-up-but-simply-apart-source-says-exclusive-97928", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/selena_justin.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber Not 'Broken Up' But Working on 'Issues' Source Says (Exclusive) | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
