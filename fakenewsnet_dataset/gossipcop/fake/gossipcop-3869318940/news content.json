And we love her for it.\n\nYesterday, People magazine published a story based on quotes from a \u201csource\u201d that said Khloe is happy with her decision to stay in Cleveland with baby True, and that she\u2019s keen to marry Tristan Thompson eventually, despite all that nasty cheating business.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cKhloe wants to get married eventually, but there are no serious wedding talks yet,\u201d the source said. \u201cShe does talk about a future with Tristan, though. She believes they can figure things out and have a happy life together.\u201d\n\nTwo hours after the story was published, Khloe tweeted: \u201cI can\u2019t believe some of the stories people create. Where do they come from and who are these \u201csources\u201d? Hummmm.\u201d\n\nIn fairness, Khloe may not have been referring to this story in particular. But she also may very well have been. You get me?\n\nKhloe still hasn\u2019t directly commented on the Tristan situation, but she certainly has been posting some super-cryptic quotes on her social media, which give us absolutely no insight into what the hell is going on. So that\u2019s fun\u2026\n\nFirst she tweeted this last week: \u201cYou will never ever regret being kind to someone.\u201d\n\nThen when someone commented, \u201cUnless they're ungrateful for it\u201d, she replied, \u201cNever give to get. Always try to give without expectations. Whether that be something tangible or emotional.\u201d\n\nThen yesterday she went on Instagram Stories to write: \u201cYour mind will always believe everything you tell it. Feed it faith. Feed it truth. Feed it with love.\u201d\n\nAnd then: \u201cNobody cares about your story until you win. So win.\u201d\n\nSoooooooo, you marrying Tristan or not, Khloe?", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alabama-barker-654387850d742.jpg?crop=0.801xw:1.00xh;0.199xw,0&resize=360:*",
