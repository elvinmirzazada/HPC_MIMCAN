So he\u2019s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn\u2019t normally talk about on a first date. I don\u2019t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. Then I knew he was nervous because he asked me if I wanted a drink. I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t drink,\u2019 and he asked if I minded if he had one.\u201d\n\nRodriguez, 42, admitted feeling \u201cuneasy\u201d going into the night, \u201cnot knowing her situation\u201d ahead of time.\n\n\u201cIt would be incredibly productive for me to sit with one of the smartest, greatest women in the world, especially for a guy like me who is coming through tough times, rehabbing himself, re-establishing himself to folks out there. I thought it would be a win-win no matter what,\u201d he explained.\n\nAfter Lopez, 48, confirmed her single status \u201caround the third or fourth inning,\u201d Rodriguez then let his fingers do the talking.\n\n\u201cI had to get up and go readjust my thoughts,\u201d he said. \u201cI went to the bathroom and got enough courage to send her a text.\u201d\n\nLopez received the text from the father of two, which read, \u201cYou look sexy AF.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then it took a turn,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fire alarm went off, and we had to evacuate.\u201d\n\nThe red-hot pair, who confirmed their romance earlier this year, have been attached at the hip since their Bahamian getaway in March. Lopez, who shares 9-year-old twins Emme and Max with ex-husband Marc Anthony, revealed in September this is the first time she\u2019s been in a \u201cgood relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe complement each other, and there\u2019s really pure, true love. Just wanting to support the other person and make them happy. So there\u2019s a different selflessness in the love that\u2019s beautiful and different. And healthy!\u201d Lopez told Hola! USA in September.", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/72948334.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/alex-jennifer.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/alex-jennifer.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/72944522.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/taylor-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/72938665.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/alex-jennifer.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Contact The Author"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/10/31/the-text-that-changed-everything-between-j-lo-and-a-rod/", "title": "The text that changed everything for J.Lo and A-Rod", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2023 NYP Holdings.
