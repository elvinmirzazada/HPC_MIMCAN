Angelina Jolie reportedly heard about her ex\u2019s potential next role and wasn\u2019t thrilled. \u201cAngelina has heard the buzz about Quentin wanting Brad for his new movie and she is not pleased,\u201d a source close to the actress EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. \u201cShe\u2019s worried about what kind of influence Quentin will be on Brad. He\u2019s a bit of a partier in her opinion and not someone Brad should be spending time with, period.\u201d\n\nYou might remember Brad, 53, worked with Quentin before on Inglourious Basterds in 2009. The director has been rumored to be circling A-listers like Brad and Jennifer Lawrence for a movie about the Manson family murders. Angelina\u2019s reportedly afraid Quentin, 54, might lead Brad back down a partying path after he\u2019s made so much progress. Brad has admitted that he had been \u201cboozing too much\u201d and it was part of the reason for his split with Angelina. At the end of the day, Angelina, 42, won\u2019t make Brad turn down the role. \u201cShe\u2019ll leave it up to Brad to make the decision,\u201d the insider revealed. \u201cYou can bet that she\u2019ll have a lot to say if he does sign on to work with Quentin again.\u201d In the meantime, Brad has lately been taking his healthy lifestyle to new heights and has never looked better. He has been totally making us swoon with his ripped bod!\n\n\u201cBrad has always been in good shape for all his life so it was easy to bounce back into the body he has now,\u201d a source explained to HollywoodLife.com. \u201cHe is happy, relaxed and is now getting familiar with his new life as a single man. The way he looks is not a revenge body at all, he just wants to live healthy and be happy. And that is exactly what is happening and his body is benefiting from his healthy lifestyle. Plan to see this Brad Putt for a long time.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Angelina should be worried about Brad? Do you want him to do another movie with Quentin?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/angelina-jolie-why-shes-worried-about-brad-pitt-quentin-tarantino-possibly-teaming-up-again-on-new-film-ftr.jpg?quality=100"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/angelina-jolie-why-shes-worried-about-brad-pitt-quentin-tarantino-possibly-teaming-up-again-on-new-film-ftr.jpg?quality=100", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allison Sadlier"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/07/14/angelina-jolie-worried-brad-pitt-reunion-quentin-tarantino/", "title": "Angelina Jolie: She\u2019s Worried About Brad Pitt & Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Potential Team Up On New Film", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Angelina Jolie has got major concerns about Brad Pitt's rumored team up with Quentin Tarantino, HollywoodLife has EXCLUSIVELY learned!", "google-site-verification": "-fFtY3InnBG-L4jhda35PWMnefeOSa7tU_YdarFQyIc", "news_keywords": "Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Quentin Tarantino", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "auto-social": "always", "author": "Allison Sadlier", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Angelina Jolie: She\u2019s Worried About Brad Pitt & Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Potential Team Up On New Film", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/07/14/angelina-jolie-worried-brad-pitt-reunion-quentin-tarantino/", "description": "Angelina Jolie has serious concerns that Brad Pitt is rumored to be going back to work with Quentin Tarantino, HollywoodLife has EXCLUSIVELY learned!
