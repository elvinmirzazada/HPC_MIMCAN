He is warm and authentic with everyone around. When he isn\u2019t filming, he spends most of his time away in his trailer.\u201d\n\nThe source notes that Pitt\u2019s children with Angelina Jolie -- Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, and the twins Knox and Vivienne -- have not visited their father during the film's production. In August, when Pitt was filming Ad Astra, a source told ET, \u201cHe's a movie star in the best way, prepared, on time and friendly. All the things you want a person to be\u2026 he is that. He's always ready to work.\u201d\n\nAs far as dating goes, despite continued reports that Pitt is dating Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Neri Oxman, the source assures ET that he is single.\n\n\u201cHe has gone on dates but he\u2019s not looking to leap into a serious relationship at the moment,\" the source reveals. \"He is content on his own and enjoys the quality time he spends with the children when he isn\u2019t working.\"\n\nThe source adds that Pitt \u201cis focused on two of the most important things he should be focused on, and those are his children and his work. Being a father is his number one job and he knows that. He will always be there for those children.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the source also mentions that when Pitt is not with the kids or on the set, \u201cHe\u2019s spending more time out and about socializing with his close friends, but he also is still a homebody and appreciates hanging around his place.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile earlier this month, Jolie was ordered by a judge to help repair their children's relationship with their dad. According to court documents obtained by ET, a judge determined that the kids \"not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them.\"\n\nIn addition, the judge determined that it is \"critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship\" with both their parents.\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-06/gettyimages-988303756.jpg?h=25a2d821&width=640", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fslides%2F150500%2Fset_brad_pitt_angelina_jolie_9_140828_450545900.jpg%3Fh%3D3a69b48c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/brad_pitt_926146458_0.jpg?h=79d1e0cd", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-03%2Fbrad_pitt_926146458_0.jpg%3Fh%3D79d1e0cd&w=256&q=75", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fslides%2F150500%2Fset_brad_pitt_angelina_jolie_getty_160920.jpg%3Fh%3Dd63ddc18&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/brad_pitt_926146458_0.jpg?h=79d1e0cd", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/why-brad-pitt-is-not-looking-to-leap-into-a-serious-relationship-right-now-exclusive-105042", "title": "Why Brad Pitt Is 'Not Looking to Leap Into a Serious Relationship' Right Now (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/brad_pitt_926146458_0.jpg?h=79d1e0cd", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "A source tells ET that the 54-year-old actor is solely focusing on his kids and work.", "title": "Why Brad Pitt Is 'Not Looking to Leap Into a Serious Relationship' Right Now (Exclusive)", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/why-brad-pitt-is-not-looking-to-leap-into-a-serious-relationship-right-now-exclusive-105042", "type": "Article"}, "description": "A source tells ET that the 54-year-old actor is solely focusing on his kids and work.", "twitter": {"description": "A source tells ET that the 54-year-old actor is solely focusing on his kids and work.", "title": "Why Brad Pitt Is 'Not Looking to Leap Into a Serious Relationship' Right Now (Exclusive)", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/why-brad-pitt-is-not-looking-to-leap-into-a-serious-relationship-right-now-exclusive-105042", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/brad_pitt_926146458_0.jpg?h=79d1e0cd", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Why Brad Pitt Is 'Not Looking to Leap Into a Serious Relationship' Right Now (Exclusive) | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Brad Pitt", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
