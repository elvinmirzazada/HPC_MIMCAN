Co-parenting is tough and it\u2019s unfortunate when your partner tries to sabotage the situation with hurtful lies and irrational behavior,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Wednesday, Gibson, 38, shared photos on Instagram saying he just wanted to co-parent his daughter, adding that his ex, Norma Mitchell Gibson, was \u201cbeing bitter, resentful\u201d and mean-spirited.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BY_VDjUHtEc/?taken-by=tyrese\n\n\u201cAll I wanna do is co/parent nothing else\u2026\u2026 Please\u2026. Stick and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt\u2026\u2026 I\u2019ve only prayed that your heart heals and we live our lives separately and peacefully on behalf of our daughter\u2026\u2026,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cThere\u2019s someone out here for everybody \u2013 Norma I know you can see this, I\u2019m sorry I got re-married, I\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t work out I\u2019m sorry you haven\u2019t been able to find another man since we separated\u2026\u2026 Sometimes you get married and have kids and things just don\u2019t work out, but I have NEVER wished harm on you.\u201d\n\nHe continued with, \u201cI was hoping by now you got over what we used to be\u2026 Being bitter, resentful and just felt out mean will has never been good for our daughter \u2026. But I see the attacks just won\u2019t stop so I believe this too will pass and God and the courts will reveal the truth.\u201d\n\nThe couple were married from 2007 to 2009, and share 10-year-old daughter, Shayla.\n\nIn court documents obtained by PEOPLE, physical and legal custody of Shayla was temporarily granted to Norma, while ordering the Fast & Furious actor to stay 100 yards away from both of them, including Norma\u2019s home, pending a hearing scheduled for Oct. 2.\n\nThe actor was not granted visitation rights before the hearing date.\n\nIn court documents, Norma accused Tyrese of of abusing their daughter on Aug. 19, alleging the actor \u201cpushed our daughter to the ground, pinned her face down, put his knees on her back, grabbed her hands with one arm and beat her with the other.\u201d\n\nPEOPLE reached out to the actor\u2019s reps but did not receive a response.\n\nNorma alleges her ex hit Shayla \u201cbetween 12 and 16 times,\u201d leading the child to allegedly later tell her mother that she couldn\u2019t sit down due to pain and saying, \u201cMum, Dad beat me so hard that it hurts when I sit down.\u201d\n\nIn her declaration, Norma claims Tyrese was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder as well as manic behavior by three psychotherapists \u2014 which she said he denied. She also expressed she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the actor taking their daughter to Dubai, where he has allegedly threatened to travel in the past \u2014 and stating the he did not return their daughter\u2019s passport to her when she requested.\n\nShe also claimed theactor withheld contact between her and Shayla while their daughter stayed with him.\n\nApart from alleging that he abused their daughter, Norma also wrote in her declaration that he was prone to \u201cbeat on the people he is in conflict with\u201d and that he had hit her \u201ca number of times in the past including when I was pregnant with our daughter.\u201d\n\nThe actor remarried to Samantha Lee Gibson on Valentine\u2019s Day in a secret ceremony.", "images":
