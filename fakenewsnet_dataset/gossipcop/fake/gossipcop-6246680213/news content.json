Appearing on the Zach Sang Show, the 24-year-old singer confessed she's worried that the track will play at her funeral. \"That's something you can't take away - swinging around naked on a wrecking ball lives forever,\" she joked. \"I am never living that down. I will always be the naked girl on a wrecking ball, no matter how much I frolic with Emu [her dog] I am always the naked girl on the wrecking ball.\"\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Getty Images\n\nMiley Cyrus revealed she is 'embarrassed' by her Wrecking Ball video\n\nSTORY: Mystery of Miley Cyrus 'wedding photo' finally solved\n\nShe added: \"I should have thought of how long that was going to follow me around.
