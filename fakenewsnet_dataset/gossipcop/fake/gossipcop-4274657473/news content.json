The have six children: Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and 9-year old twins Vivienne and Knox.\n\nJason Merritt/Getty\n\nThe judge outlined some specific steps Jolie should take to improving Pitt\u2019s access and relationship to the children. For example, the actress and humanitarian was asked to provide the actor with the cell phone number of each child and allow him to call anytime.\n\nAlso, the judge said Jolie is not allowed to read their text messages with Pitt or secretly monitor his calls in anyway.\n\nThe court also outlined a detailed summer visitation schedule for the couple. Maddox was not included in the arrangement because at 16-years-old, the court determined he was old enough to decide how much time to spend with Pitt on his own.\n\nPitt will spend June 8 to June 17 with the kids for four hours a day while he stays in London, where his ex-wife is currently renting a home and shooting Maleficent 2. Pitt will host one or two of the minor at a time, and will spend time with each child at least twice. Jolie is not allowed to be present during Pitt\u2019s time with the children.\n\nThen from June 27 through July 1, Pitt gets custody for 10 hours per day under the same scheduling circumstances. A child therapist will also be with the children during this time.\n\nFrom July 8 through July 14, Pitt will spend four consecutive days with the kids. A therapist will be present during that time and will meet with the kids before and after each two day period.\n\nDia Dipasupil/FilmMagic\n\nFrom July 21 through July 29, Pitt gets custody of the kids when he returns to California. Jolie will handle the kids\u2019 travel from London to L.A., and Pitt will handle their return trip to London.\n\nOnce back in L.A., Pitt can decide where to stay with the kids, but must make arrangements for their visits with therapists and doctors.\n\nWhen the kids are with Pitt, Jolie is restricted to one phone call a day at a prearranged time agreed to by both parties.\n\nJolie\u2019s kids are continuing their school work in a designated trailer while Jolie films Maleficent 2 in London. Meanwhile, Pitt is beginning work on a new film and will juggle filming and going back forth to London to see his kids, multiple sources tell PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cShe will focus only on their children and being with them,\u201d a source told PEOPLE earlier this year about Jolie\u2019s life as she goes through her divorce from Pitt.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/rZRYwhhOVDtqR_5IH-h8uY3Cy1g=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt1-2a941b7ab64d48c98870735131226f2f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/E3fHdDVWJzZwunZU9TAMaiziYtA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/angelina-jolie6-2200256a2fd94bd8b383bc4ae208452c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tSGBZaSj5KfVNfkjQaUDQ2qWj_U=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x534:961x536)/jolie-pitt-1-05e3a0fd919e400ea00e8c4eb0113e5b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/coQa4dBkosb4T8uaWt1YmF9g1C8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/todd-chrisley-kids-2-01d64ee7e35b46b88821ca2950f81329.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lNioB4k8UehjHlpWsD3NkwJMIiw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(329x0:331x2)/angelina-1-660-b7acb70869204fdeb2165eeb57d84b1d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/LJD-emsQDyXAMnyRr9zbFyGoLuA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(359x359:361x361)/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-081722-07707bdf1bac4d79b98cf3b6f1e96ef4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/yI-wzF18m0GeS4zGTSt_lUPZtPY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(651x459:653x461)/shaquille-shaunie-oneal-1-a379fa7921d14a88a52903ff7b33dc59.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/IZnJ87soHofJqeu2A101vswTgLQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Brad-Pitt-Lists-Los-Feliz-Home-011723-1-81a0f4e8cd654a58a647bda1f5320f7c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/itqb15OVnPsUjCRGcmivynnKoE4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(630x239:632x241)/seal-heidi-klum-2000-48ab9ab572794a5cb18514019a781b2c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/544oDJmjibNAl2GIcF5I6vr3ARY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1059x554:1061x556)/dwayne-wade-siohvaughn-funches-1-ad6914b5a6e743ad99e8be98d0409ae9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Kly0w-ivZDkOrwRlyQVRBbvE4N4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(531x419:533x421)/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-1-ca19f56f8d8f419ea04518c2c6e7ac1c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/FRbZ0eOWWTYjkWeolORNj1yM3Dk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(815x8:817x10)/drew-ralph-divorce-022823-1-2484817f40ab4efe9e4533f69594862b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rtKqIPTM5Js2wlIneQJ0c4C1WZg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(657x0:659x2)/angelina-jolie-3-2000-ec9927eeee224fc293cce4569cd82eab.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/cJXaGOoZWmgHxiYvXPKzUD3yfio=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x524:961x526)/brad-pitt-e1794387d9c041d49ea26b0b3019e204.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3Hs-JkpKL_0C2Rb5CmS6UJDQMXE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(587x223:589x225)/angelina-jolie-1-2b124302a8644440a370dfb00176c94b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/euNukueh_n_DqcqMYHdCaKdaJt4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(587x287:589x289)/ines-de-ramon-brad-pitt-2-1116-a8d9fed9264a4aa39129d46724b9e351.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/YHL-BSb4rHAvdoBx9FPynycjzV8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(16487x12399:16489x12401)/olivia-wilde-2-1-4bcef418cdd948e8bd3e283e71e3e22c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/YcQ3C9s2BhnrK_y8FUJAEXhZSZI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(667x619:669x621)/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-4-38b73b86164f47a2ae5d356136fbd701.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/lNioB4k8UehjHlpWsD3NkwJMIiw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(329x0:331x2)/angelina-1-660-b7acb70869204fdeb2165eeb57d84b1d.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Miller", "Mike Miller Is A Former Writer", "Reporter At People.
