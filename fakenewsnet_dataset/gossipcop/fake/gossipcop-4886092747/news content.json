But she is also very much her own woman, as independent-spirited when it comes to fame and feminism as she has been in facing down Donald Trump.\n\nKristen wears Chanel on the newsstand cover\n\nRead highlights from the interview below:\n\nOn being in love:\n\n\"I've been deeply in love with everyone I've dated. Did you think I was faking it? I've always really embraced a duality. And really, truly, believed in it and never felt confused or struggling. I just didn't like getting made fun of.\"\n\nOn dating men again:\n\n\"Yeah, totally. Definitely\u2026 Some people aren't like that. Some people know that they like grilled cheese and they'll eat it every day for the rest of their lives. I want to try everything. If I have grilled cheese once I'm like, 'That was cool, what's next?'\"\n\nKristen with then-boyfriend Robert Pattinson in 2011, and with current girlfriend Stella Maxwell in June 2017. Getty Images\n\nOn fame:\n\n\"Fame is valued quite ridiculously. So then there's this idea that you're beholden in some way, and I resent that. And it comes across like I'm ungrateful or something but, actually, I just find it weird to talk to the general public as a whole. Like, you can relate to a person, you can relate to an individual, but addressing the world at large is something that just perplexes me.\"\n\nOn whether she suffers from 'Resting Bitch Face':\n\n\"Completely. I'm really not introverted - I'm just not acting all the time, which is what it would take to look like how people expect famous people to behave.\"\n\n\"Men cannot say bitch anymore, I'm sorry. Say something different. Say, 'You're rude,' say, 'You're a dick,' whatever. Just to say, 'Oh that bitch.' You can't say that because there's nothing I could say to you, there's no retort that would be equal to that, therefore it's demeaning and literally on par with... something homophobic or something racist.\"\n\nOn life as a woman in the United States, post Trump:\n\n\"It's obviously terrible what's happening but at the same time, it feels good to be part of a wider female community that is finally standing up for itself. I've never felt such a strong sense of community. So it's brought us together. The catalyst for this is regrettable, obviously, it's shitty. But at the same time I think that you need something to stir things up in order to get people to come together and define their opinions and force them to be heard.\"\n\nKristen wears Chanel, photographed by Tom Craig\n\nOn her tomboy style:\n\nShe used to dress as \"a total tomboy\" and it was only at school that she realised it was \"not the most normal thing. Not all little girls are that way. And it actually really hurt my feelings, like badly. Like, I remember being in the sixth grade [aged 11] and [people would say] 'Kristen looks like a man. You're a boy', or whatever, and I was so offended, horrified and embarrassed. Now I look back on it and I'm like, 'Girl, be proud of that!'\"\n\nEverything shifted when Stewart hit puberty and grew her hair long. Suddenly she was accepted as one of the pretty girls \"and I was like, 'Fuck all of you!'\"\n\nWatch below as Kristen explores Coco Chanel's apartment following her cover shoot:\n\nThe September issue of Harper's Bazaar is available on newsstands from 4 August.\n\nKristen wears Chanel on the subscribers' cover", "images":
