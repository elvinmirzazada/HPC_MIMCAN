{"url": "people.com/music/miranda-lambert-anderson-east-split/", "text": "After weeks of buzz about a split, Miranda Lambert and boyfriend Anderson East have called it quits, reports Us Weekly.\n\nReps for Lambert and East did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn early March, the country star hinted at a possible breakup when she reflected on pouring her emotions into her music during a concert at the Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nJohn Shearer/WireImage\n\n\u201cI make it my mission every single time I step on the stage that no matter what, no matter where I am, I want to make you feel everything you could possibly feel,\u201d Lambert said before performing an acoustic version of her hit \u201cTin Man,\u201d as reported by local news outlet Knox News.\n\n\u201cI want you to feel sad, mad, happy and nostalgic and really pissed sometimes. That\u2019s my favorite. And part of feelings is also heartbreak, unfortunately,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cBut fortunately for me, I can use it for my art or whatever. I like to write sad songs. I like to listen to sad songs, so I want to sing y\u2019all one,\u201d Lambert concluded.\n\nRick Diamond/ACMA2017/Getty\n\nThe country singers first began dating in the fall of 2015 months after she and ex-husband Blake Shelton announced their divorce in July.\n\nThe following April, Lambert, 34, and East, 30, made their romance red carpet official at the 2016 ACMs, where they cozied up inside the show as she picked up the award for female vocalist of the year.\n\nThe \u201cVice\u201d singer \u2014 who\u2019s remained tight-lipped about her latest relationship \u2014 briefly mentioned East in Cosmopolitan\u2018s first-ever country issue last year.\n\n\u201cThe last thing I googled was my boyfriend Anderson East to show off his cute pictures,\u201d she told the magazine.\n\nSource: Miranda Lambert/Instagram\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Miranda Lambert Writes Loving Post for 2-Year Anniversary with Boyfriend Anderson East\n\nIn January, East opened up about his relationship to InStyle, saying there was \u201ctrue admiration there and a large level of understanding on both sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to be a traveling musician and still keep things together,\u201d he added. \u201cUnderstanding is definitely a huge factor.\u201d\n\nMiranda Lambert/Instagram\n\nWhile Lambert has stayed mum about East in the media, she\u2019s shared glimpses of their life together on her Instagram throughout their two years together.\n\n\u201cMy favorite Bama boy turned 30 today. He owns the stage and he owns my heart. Thanks @andersoneast for inspiring me in so many ways. You are a light that could outshine the sun. I love making memories with you,\u201d she captioned a tribute for his 30th birthday last July.\n\nLambert and East no longer follow each other on Instagram and were last photographed together in public at the 2017 CMA Awards in November.", "images":
