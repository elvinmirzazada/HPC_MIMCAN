{"url": "www.royal.uk/the-duchess-of-cambridge", "text": "About The Princess of Wales\n\nEarly Childhood Support\n\nThrough her work over the past decade, The Princess of Wales has seen first-hand how some of today\u2019s hardest social challenges have their roots in the earliest years of a person\u2019s life. The Princess is committed to raising awareness of the importance of early childhood experiences and of collaborative action in order to improve outcomes across society.\n\nIn March 2018, Her Royal Highness convened a steering group to look at what could be done to bring about long-lasting change to the lives of children, by focusing on their earliest stage of life from pre-birth to 5 years of age. The steering group's recommendations, on behalf of The Princess, have formed the basis of The Royal Foundation's strategy for developing her work in this area in years to come.\n\nIn January 2020, The Princess launched \u20185 Big Questions on the Under Fives\u2019 \u2013 a landmark survey which aimed to start a nationwide conversation on early childhood. The findings of the survey were unveiled later that year, alongside in-depth qualitative and ethnographic research conducted by Ipsos MORI.\n\nIn June 2021, Her Royal Highness highlighted her dedication to the cause by launching The Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, which will drive awareness of and action on the extraordinary impact of the early years, in order to transform society for generations to come.\n\nIn February 2022, Her Royal Highness visited Denmark to learn about the Danish approach to early childhood development and to explore how The Centre for Early Childhood can take learnings from this world-leading work.\n\n\u201cI have seen that experiences such as homelessness, addiction, and poor mental health are often grounded in a difficult childhood. But I have also seen, how positive protective factors in the early years can play a critical role in shaping our futures too.\u201d - The Princess of Wales\n\nChildren's Mental Health\n\nAs part of Her Royal Highness's work around early childhood, The Princess of Wales is a committed champion of issues related to children\u2019s mental health and emotional wellbeing. Her Royal Highness has worked to bring wider public attention to the fact that issues facing children today such as addiction, poverty, abuse, neglect, loss and illness of family members, can have a long-lasting and traumatic impact if left unsupported. Moreover, academic research has shown conclusively that early childhood trauma will affect mental health long into adulthood, with significant costs to individuals, their families, society and the economy.\n\nIn particular, Her Royal Highness has highlighted the need for open and honest conversations about the subject of mental health to try and combat stigma, and also the importance of early intervention mental health support for young people, to tackle these issues at the earliest possible stage so that children have the brightest possible futures.\n\nHeads Together\n\nIn 2017, The Princess of Wales championed the Heads Together mental health campaign with The Prince of Wales and The Duke of Sussex. Together, they lead a coalition of eight mental health charity partners to change the national conversation on mental health: Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families; Best Beginnings; CALM \u2013 The Campaign Against Living Miserably; Contact (a military mental health coalition); Mind; Place2Be; The Mix; and YoungMinds. The campaign aimed to build on existing progress nationwide in tackling stigma, raising awareness, and providing vital help for people with mental health problems.\n\nHeads Together was privileged to be the 2017 Virgin Money London Marathon Charity of the Year giving the campaign a positive platform to raise funds for the charity partners and to start millions of conversations about mental wellbeing.\n\nSince then The Prince and Princess of Wales have continued to spearhead and support a range of mental health programmes through The Royal Foundation, including the Mentally Healthy Schools and Mental Health at Work initiatives, and Shout 85258, a free crisis text line providing 24/7 support for anyone experiencing a mental health crisis.\n\nSport and the Outdoors\n\nThe Princess of Wales strongly believes that spending time outdoors plays a pivotal role in children\u2019s future health and happiness, building foundations that last through childhood and over a lifetime.\n\nThe Princess is also keen sportswoman and strongly believes that physical health not only complements mental health, but also has the power to engage, educate and inspire and change lives for the better. Her Royal Highness's passion for sport, nature and the outdoors stems from her own experience and enjoyment of playing tennis and hockey and sailing from a young age.\n\nIn 2019, The Princess designed and built a series of Back to Nature gardens which were displayed at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show and Hampton Court Palace Garden Festival. The gardens aimed to highlight how spending time outdoors can enrich a child\u2019s early development by encouraging active exploration and providing the opportunity to form and strengthen positive relationships. The project culminated in the creation of a permanent Back to Nature play garden at RHS Wisley, which Her Royal Highness officially opened in September 2019.\n\nHer Royal Highness has continued this work by showing her support for those organisations working to ensure young people have access to get outdoors to enjoy the natural world and take part in physical activity. She is Royal Patron of several sport-related institutions: SportsAid, The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, The Lawn Tennis Association, and The 1851 Trust.\n\nVisual Arts\n\nThe Princess of Wales has a longstanding interest in the visual arts, photography, design and textiles, having studied History of Art at St. Andrews University. Her Royal Highness is Patron of several arts organisations, including the National Portrait Gallery, the V&A and the Royal Photographic Society.\n\nA passionate photographer, The Princess has shared many of her photos with the public over the years. In January 2020 she took part in a special photography project to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust, contributing two powerful photographic portraits of Holocaust survivors and their families.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in May 2020 Her Royal Highness created Hold Still, a photography project launched in partnership with the National Portrait Gallery, which invited members of the public to share photographic portraits they had taken during lockdown, providing a unique record of the nation\u2019s shared and individual experiences as the pandemic took hold.\n\nFrom over 31,000 entries a final selection of 100 portraits were chosen to form a digital exhibition, which was later brought to the streets of the UK as part of a community exhibition. The project culminated in the publication of the Hold Still book, proceeds of which were shared between leading mental health charity Mind and the National Portrait Gallery to support arts and mental health projects across the UK.\n\nRoyal Patronages\n\nThe Princess of Wales is Patron of a number of organisations which have close association with her specific charitable interests, and where she feels her support can make a difference. These broadly reflect her desire to help the most vulnerable children, young people and their families, as well as to promote opportunities though sport and the outdoors, and showcasing national institutions which reflect her love of the visual arts.\n\nAs their Royal Patron, Her Royal Highness will support their key projects and initiatives, spotlight their work through her programme of official engagements and where appropriate by convening organisations to work in support of each other.\n\nThe Royal Foundation\n\nThe Princess of Wales, like her husband, also directs her own philanthropic work through The Royal Foundation.\n\nThe Foundation develops programmes and charitable projects based on the interests of Their Royal Highnesses by working with organisations which are already making a proven impact in their respective fields. The Royal Foundation mobilises leaders, businesses and people so that together we can address society\u2019s greatest challenges. The organisation\u2019s work is built on world-class research, long-term partnerships, and measurable, scalable impact.", "images":
