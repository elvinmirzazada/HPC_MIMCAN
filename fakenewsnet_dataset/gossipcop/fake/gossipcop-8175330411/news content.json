Reports also claimed that the lip kit businesswoman was annoyed with the supposed fact that Tyga would spend more time at the club with his friends than with her at their home in Calabasas.\n\nAs of right now, it doesn\u2019t seem as if Kylie Jenner has any plans to get back with the \u201cRack City\u201d rapper in the near future, which has led Kris to throw in her two cents, allegedly telling her daughter that she should consider the idea of dating Drake.\n\nThe \u201cOne Dance\u201d hitmaker has become a very close friend to the Kardashians over the last couple of years, having even attended Kylie\u2019s 17th birthday party two years ago. The family famously invited Drake over for dinner a year ago, having also attended their Christmas party in 2015.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that Drake is no stranger to Kylie Jenner or her famous family.\n\nSo, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a stretch to consider the potential chances of Kylie and Drake hooking up \u2014 at least according to Hollywood Life.\n\nThe outlet suggests that Drake and Kylie would make a perfect couple, especially with Kris Jenner under their wings, who is already said to be working her magic to make it happen. The momager reportedly believes that dating Drake is a complete upgrade from Tyga: Drizzy and Kylie Jenner are super successful and share a lot of things in common, so it\u2019s a match made in heaven, it would seem.\n\n\u201cKris wants to see Kylie move on from Tyga, she thinks the drama and the constant back and forth is a waste of time,\u201d an insider tells Hollywood Life. \u201cShe wants to see her happy and get out there and start dating.\u201d\n\n\u201cKris thinks Kylie should give Drake a chance, she wants them to date. Kylie Jenner and Drake are friends, she\u2019s cool with him but she\u2019s still very wrapped up in Tyga. While Kim and Kris are in Kylie\u2019s ear telling her to dump him, Khloe and Kourtney are telling her to make it work.\u201d\n\nAs the source already mentions, while Kylie Jenner has more or less accepted the fact that she won\u2019t be getting back with Tyga, she\u2019s still hanging on the two-year relationship she shared with her 27-year-old ex-boyfriend, with a source adding that it\u2019s not that easy for her to move on.\n\nLast year, it was even claimed, via Heat World, that Kylie Jenner had confided in her family, telling them that she was convinced she would end up marrying the \u201cFaded\u201d rapper in the near future, adding that she couldn\u2019t see herself with anybody else but him.\n\nNow that allegations regarding baby mama drama and cheating affairs have come forward, Kylie Jenner has definitely had a change of heart. She doesn\u2019t want to surround herself with people that could potentially waste her energy on something that she shouldn\u2019t be focused on in the first place.\n\nWith business booming, Kylie Jenner\u2019s main concern is continuing to market her brand, and while she still cares for Tyga, it seems evidently clear that their romance has officially come to an end.\n\nWhat do you think? Will Kylie Jenner end up dating Drake in the near future?\n\n[Featured Image by Jason Kempin/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/inquisitr_cross.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v3/assets/search-icon.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maurice Cassidy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4127742/kylie-jenner-drake-to-date-after-tyga-split-kris-jenner-organizing-kuwtk-get-together", "title": "Kylie Jenner, Drake To Date After Tyga Split: Kris Jenner Organizing \u2018KUWTK\u2019 Get-Together?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kylie Jenner could potentially land herself a date with Drake if momager Kris Jenner has it her way, it has been alleged.
