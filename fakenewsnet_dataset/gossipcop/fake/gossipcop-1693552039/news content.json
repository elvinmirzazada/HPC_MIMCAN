Pak Chong Mar, 72, sliced his wrists with a boxcutter at about 7:50 a.m. after screaming 'The IRS is trying to take my money! I\u2019m not a freeloader!' witnesses told The Post.\n\nThe story only mentions \"Today\" show host Lauer in passing -- as having come out of Rock Center with colleague Al Roker to briefly look at what was happening. But it does make a point of describing Lauer as \"reeling since the Ann Curry fiasco.\" (Yes, surely Lauer's well-documented clash with former co-host Curry was top-of-mind as he surveyed a scene the Post described as including \"gushing blood.\")\n\nKeepin' it classy as always, New York Post.\n\nUPDATE: Separately, the New York Post is cutting 13 full-time positions, via Romenesko.\n\nSimon Dumenco is the \"Media Guy\" columnist for Advertising Age.
