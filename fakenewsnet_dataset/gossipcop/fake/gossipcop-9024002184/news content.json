{"url": "www.glamour.com/story/chrissy-teigen-postpartum-depression", "text": "Let me start here: To a lot of you, I think, I seem like the happiest person on the planet. I have an incredible husband\u2014John and I have been together for over 10 years. He has seen my successes and failures; I\u2019ve seen his. He has seen me at my worst, but I will say I don\u2019t think I have ever seen him at his. He\u2019s exactly as compassionate, patient, loving, and understanding as he seems. And I hate it. OK, I don\u2019t hate it. But it can certainly drive you nuts sometimes when you\u2019re as cynical as I am. If I weren\u2019t me, I would politely excuse myself to make the most epic eye roll of all time if a woman talked to me about her significant other the way I just did to you.\n\nWhen John and I got together, I found my love for cooking. On one of our earliest dates, I took him to Daniel (four dollar signs on Yelp, ahhh!). I drank a $40 margarita, ate salmon rillettes (fancy salmon spread), and prayed my card wouldn\u2019t be declined. I couldn\u2019t afford to take him out to more dinners like that, so I started cooking more and more at home for us. I started with my own version of that salmon spread, then roasted whole branzino, osso buco, chipotle BBQ chicken. When my first cookbook came out, I finally felt proud of my work. I feel that same pride in Lip Sync Battle, where I get to work with LL Cool J and watch Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan go head-to-head as Beyonc\u00e9 and motherf-cking Paula Abdul. My job, essentially, is to have the best time humanly possible.\n\nAnd a year ago, in April, John and I started our family together. We had our daughter, Luna, who is perfect. She is somehow exactly me, exactly John, and exactly herself. I adore her.\n\nI had everything I needed to be happy. And yet, for much of the last year, I felt unhappy. What basically everyone around me\u2014but me\u2014knew up until December was this: I have postpartum depression. How can I feel this way when everything is so great? I\u2019ve had a hard time coming to terms with that, and I hesitated to even talk about this, as everything becomes such a \u201cthing.\u201d During pregnancy, what I thought were casual comments about IVF turned into headlines about me choosing the sex of my daughter. And I can already envision what will be said about me after this admission. But it\u2019s such a major part of my life and so, so many other women\u2019s lives. It would feel wrong to write anything else. So here goes.\n\nI had such a wonderful, energetic pregnancy. Luna sat inside me like a little cross-legged Buddha facing toward my back for nine months. I never saw her face in a sonogram, just her butt or the back of her feet. Every time we kinnnnd of saw a nose, she would quickly dodge, and I was left guessing again. John, my mom, and my sister were all in the delivery room. John was DJ-ing. Luna, fittingly, popped out to the song \u201cSuperfly.\u201d The first lyric is \u201cDarkest of night. With the moon shining bright.\u201d I immediately put her on my chest. And she had a face! I was so happy. And exhausted.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/6542dfe0fb0f38a67fc72589/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-02%20at%205.46.35%20PM.png", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/65302f5200064edef5a1dd89/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7450629d72400bb1f5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-03.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7444ad5e14c23a03a9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-01.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/65577abb5248f9740d03ad42/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7540800d79a851f027/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-pullquote.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f766b5e90715a100cce/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-lede.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f740aac72189c03c1fd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-02.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f755dc429701015cb98/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-04.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/65564123074272498557cee3/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-02%20at%205.46.35%20PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Chrissy Teigen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/chrissy-teigen-postpartum-depression", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Opens Up for the First Time About Her Postpartum Depression", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "In her interview for the cover of Glamour's April 2017 issue, Chrissy Teigen opens up about her postpartum depression.", "id": "58b741e550629d72400bb20b", "keywords": "chrissy teigen,cover stars,postpartum,motherhood", "news_keywords": "chrissy teigen,cover stars,postpartum,motherhood", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58b741e550629d72400bb20b", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In her interview for the cover of Glamour's April 2017 issue, Chrissy Teigen opens up about her postpartum depression.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7450629d72400bb1f5/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-03.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7450629d72400bb1f5/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-03.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\"The mental pain of knowing I let so many people down at once was worse than the physical pain.\"", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-02%20at%205.46.35%20PM.png", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Opens Up About Her Postpartum Depression", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/chrissy-teigen-postpartum-depression"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-03-06T13:15:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-03-06T13:15:00.000Z", "author": "Chrissy Teigen"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "\"The mental pain of knowing I let so many people down at once was worse than the physical pain.\"", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-02%20at%205.46.35%20PM.png?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Opens Up About Her Postpartum Depression"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-02%20at%205.46.35%20PM.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488806100.0, "source": "http://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
