The distance between them has taken its toll.\" The gossip site tweeted, \"Ryan Reynolds and wife Blake Lively struggling to spend 'quality time'\" together.\n\nAnd Reynolds' response to this report? \"I wish. I could use a little 'me time'.\"\n\nAs per usual, Reynolds is ready to tease his wife on social media, which suggests that their marriage is more than fine.\n\nReynolds and Lively have a long history of trolling one another, and their constant joking appears to help keep their relationship alive.\n\nBut, perhaps the couple's sweetest online moment, was when Reynolds was photographed with Lively for the Humans of New York Instagram account. Explaining why their marriage worked, Reynolds revealed:\n\n\"She always responds with empathy. She meets anger with empathy. She meets hate with empathy. She'll take the time to imagine what happened to a person when they were five or six years old. And she's made me a more empathetic person. I had a very fractured relationship with my father. Before he died, she made me remember things I didn't want to remember. She made me remember the good times.\"\n\nIt's pretty clear that Reynolds and Lively are just fine right now, thank you very much.", "images":
