We chatted a lot, and in the end we both realized\u2014I definitely realized\u2014that I had to come back.\u201d Returning to St. Andrews, he was much happier with his switch to geography.\n\n\u201cKate\u2019s hot!\u201d\n\nIt was the night of the annual Don\u2019t Walk charity fashion show, March 27, 2002, during William\u2019s second semester, when the moment of realization suddenly hit him. As Kate shimmied down the catwalk at the five-star St. Andrews Bay Hotel, William turned to Fergus and whispered, \u201cWow, Fergus, Kate\u2019s hot!\u201d He had paid \u00a3200 for his front-row ticket, and when Kate appeared in black underwear and a see-through dress William barely knew where to look. \u201cKate was great on the catwalk,\u201d recalled one of the models. \u201cShe and everyone, including William, knew it.\u201d\n\nAt a party after the show William decided to make his move. As the music throbbed and beautiful young things sat sipping homemade cocktails on the winding staircase of the student house, William and Kate were huddled in a quiet corner, deep in conversation. As they clinked their glasses to toast Kate\u2019s success, William leaned in to kiss her. It was Kate who pulled away, momentarily stunned that he had been so bold in a room full of strangers. At the time she was dating Rupert Finch, a fourth-year student, but William didn\u2019t seem to care. \u201cIt was clear to us that William was smitten with Kate,\u201d remembered one of their friends who was at the party and witnessed the moment. \u201cHe actually told her she was a knockout that night, which caused her to blush. There was definitely chemistry between them, and Kate had really made an impression on William. She played it very cool, and at one point when William seemed to lean in to kiss her, she pulled away. She didn\u2019t want to give off the wrong impression or make it too easy for Will.\u201d\n\nAfter her impressive debut on the catwalk, things would never be quite the same between William and Kate. William had insisted in an interview on his 21st birthday, June 21, 2003, that he was single, but the truth was that he had fallen for his pretty friend.\n\nOne of William\u2019s conditions for staying at St. Andrews was that he would be allowed to move out of the residence halls after his first year and share an apartment with his friends. So at the start of his second year, September 2002, William moved off campus to 13a Hope Street, in the center of town. It was a luxury no prince before him had enjoyed and exactly the normalcy he craved. There were the necessary security issues to consider: the property was fitted with bulletproof windows, a bombproof front door, and a state-of-the-art laser security system that came with a thick instruction manual. The floor-to-ceiling windows were also protected with reinforced, full-length pine shutters in keeping with the rest of the street. William\u2019s room was the biggest and it looked onto an overgrown private garden and the back of the student-union building, on Market Street.\n\nHe had decided to move in with Kate, Fergus, and Olivia Bleasdale. They each paid \u00a3100 a week in rent for the two-story, top-floor apartment and shared the cleaning. \u201cThey did throw dinner parties and took turns to go shopping for groceries,\u201d one of their friends recalled. \u201cWilliam was part of the dinner-party brigade, and being seen in Tesco was all part of it. It was a bit of a meeting place for the great and the good. Fergus would get dressed to the nines and only ever wore different shades of white. William was always with him, so it was not uncommon for girls to stake out Tesco in the hope of seeing the pair of them.\u201d\n\nWilliam and Kate were determined to keep their fledgling romance quiet, and behind the closed doors of 13a Hope Street they could. Their bedrooms were on separate landings, but by this stage it was nothing more than pretense. William and Kate had fallen in love and were enjoying a conventional university romance, albeit one involving elaborate cover-ups and decoys. In a bid to keep their relationship below the radar for as long as possible, they would leave the house at different times and arrive at dinner parties separately, and made a pact never to hold hands in public.\n\nBy the end of their second year the relationship was a close one. When William attended Kate\u2019s belated 21st-birthday party, in June 2003, at her family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, the glance she threw him across the room when he walked into the 1920s-themed party was more than platonic. But then, at William\u2019s 21st-birthday party at Windsor Castle, later that month, it seemed as though Kate was barely registering with William; he seemed preoccupied with a very pretty girl named Jecca Craig.\n\nOut of Africa\n\nWilliam had first met Jecca, daughter of British conservationist Ian Craig and his wife, Jane, in 1998 in Kenya during a school holiday. He had fallen in love with Africa and returned during his gap year to spend several weeks learning about conservation at the Craigs\u2019 55,000-acre game preserve, situated in the beautiful Lewa Downs, in the foothills of Mount Kenya. William had adored every minute of it and years later would get involved with the Tusk Trust, a conservation charity which finances some of Lewa\u2019s activities and of which William is now a patron. Ian Craig recalled, \u201cWilliam just loves Africa, that\u2019s clear. He did everything from rhino spotting to anti-poaching patrols to checking fences. He\u2019s a great boy.\u201d It was not long before rumors were circulating among their friends that something was going on. William had apparently had a secret crush on Jecca since the first time he met her. She was beautiful, with long blond hair, deep-blue eyes, and legs like a gazelle\u2019s. But when it was reported in British papers that the two had staged a mock engagement ceremony to pledge their love to each other before William returned to England, the prince instructed his aides to deny this had happened.\n\nIt was a rare move\u2014usually the Palace never comments on the princes\u2019 private lives\u2014but on this occasion William wanted the story refuted. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of speculation about every single girl I\u2019m with, and it actually does quite irritate me after a while, more so because it\u2019s a complete pain for the girls,\u201d he said. The tale had rattled him and embarrassed Jecca, who at the time was dating Edinburgh University undergraduate Henry Ropner, a former Etonian and a friend of William\u2019s. The denial did little to quash the rumors of a romance, however, and as Kate raised her champagne flute to toast the birthday prince at the aptly themed Out of Africa celebration, it was Jecca who had pride of place next to William at the head table.\n\nBy the end of the summer, however, the relationship with Kate seemed back on track. It soon became an open secret at St. Andrews, and William and Kate were desperate for some privacy. While Fergus decided to stay on at 13a Hope Street, they chose to move out to Balgove House, on Strathtyrum, a sprawling private estate a quarter of a mile outside the town center, the property of a wealthy landowner, Henry Cheape, a distant cousin of the prince\u2019s and close friend of the royals\u2019. The impressive four-bedroom cottage was far more private than Hope Street. Unmarked police cars patrolled the estate, and William\u2019s protection officers lived in the assorted outbuildings. As with all his residences, the cottage had been made secure for the prince, complete with bombproof doors and windows. William and Kate intended to entertain frequently: he installed a champagne fridge as soon as they moved in, while Kate set about dressing the kitchen windows with pretty red-and-white gingham curtains. As well as the grounds, where they enjoyed long romantic walks, the couple had the privacy of two acres of wild grassland hidden behind a six-foot stone wall. When it was warm enough, they would pack a picnic hamper and spend pleasant afternoons stretched out on a blanket, sharing a bottle of chilled white wine. They were blissful days, made all the more romantic by the fact that the press was unaware of their relationship. But the secret would soon be out.\n\n\u201cMore than Just Friends \u2026\u201d\n\nAgainst a backdrop of snowcapped Alps, William put his arm around Kate. Wrapped up against the cold mountain air in their pants and ski jackets, they waited in line for a ski lift. As the T-bar arrived, William helped Kate on, and they glided up the steep mountain, ski poles in their hands. The shot of William gazing lovingly at Kate that was published in the Sun newspaper on April 1, 2004, was no April Fools\u2019 joke. The rumors, which had been around for months, were confirmed: William and Kate were definitely more than just friends. \u201cIf I fancy a girl and she fancies me back, which is rare, I ask her out. But at the same time I don\u2019t want to put them in an awkward situation, because a lot of people don\u2019t understand what comes with knowing me, for one\u2014and secondly, if they were my girlfriend, the excitement it would probably cause,\u201d William had remarked in that 21st-birthday interview. He was right about the excitement. He had chosen to go to Klosters, Switzerland, where the royal family are photographed every year, and he had made no attempt to disguise his affection for Kate. They were with a group of friends that included former nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke\u2019s brother Harry, Guy Pelly, and William van Cutsem and his girlfriend, Katie James. The Palace was furious and accused The Sun of breaching the embargo that protected Prince William during his university years. But the paper had decided that this was a scoop just too good to turn down. FINALLY \u2026WILLS GETS A GIRL was the headline. The truth was he had had her for many months. Suddenly the floodgates opened, and the world wanted to know everything about this shy, pretty, and unassuming girl.\n\nWhile some at the Palace have snootily pontificated that Kate was not blueblooded enough for the prince (her parents own Party Pieces, an online party-supply company), she had other qualities that were far more important to William. She was polite to the photographers who now pursued her, and she quickly adopted the royal rule of never speaking out. She also insisted that her family never discuss her relationship with William. As Princess Diana\u2019s former private secretary Patrick Jephson noted, \u201cWe know very little about her and probably never will, providing they do their job right. Historically a degree of mystery about royalty has been an advantage; we project onto them what we want.\u201d According to one of her friends at St. Andrews, she remained levelheaded and kept her feet on the ground during the early months of their courtship. \u201cShe never got above her station, and even though she had secured the most sought-after boy at St. Andrews, she never gloated. She was actually quite insecure about her looks and never considered herself pretty; she was very sweet and very shy.\u201d\n\nLike Diana, Kate quickly had to adapt to being in the spotlight, but her transition into royal life was much smoother\u2014unlike Diana, Kate enjoyed being at Highgrove, Balmoral, and Sandringham, where she would accompany William on shoots during the grouse and pheasant seasons. She had practiced with William on the Strathtyrum estate, where they were allowed to shoot birds for food as part of their rental agreement. Like Charles, who had been given the use of Wood Farm, at Sandringham, while he was at Cambridge, the Queen allowed William to use a cottage called Tam-na-Ghar, at Balmoral, as a getaway. Tucked away in the remote countryside, the 120-year-old cottage, which is surrounded by rolling hills and wild heather as far as the eye can see, underwent a \u00a3150,000 renovation, complete with a bathtub big enough for two, before William and Harry were each given a set of keys.\n\nAfter their last class on Friday, William and Kate would speed up to Balmoral from St. Andrews in William\u2019s black Volkswagen Golf, followed by his protection officers. Like William, Kate loved walking across the moors and strolling by the river Dee. In the evenings they would cook a meal, share a bottle of red wine, and keep warm in front of a roaring log fire. Sometimes they were joined by friends from St. Andrews, and often her siblings Pippa and James, whose trophy stag heads line the walls of the Middleton-family house, would be invited for a weekend\u2019s shoot, when they would compete as to who could bag the most birds.\n\n\u201cWE KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT KATE MIDDLETON AND PROBABLY NEVER WILL, PROVIDING THEY DO THEIR JOB RIGHT. HISTORICALLY A DEGREE OF MYSTERY ABOUT ROYALTY HAS BEEN AN ADVANTAGE.\u201d\n\nTrouble in Paradise\n\nIt was the summer of 2004 when William and Kate\u2019s love affair underwent its first serious test. With one year to complete before they graduated, the 22-year-old prince needed some space\u2014he told several of his friends at St. Andrews that he was feeling \u201cclaustrophobic.\u201d Until now they had chosen not to discuss what would happen after St. Andrews, but with their finals looming, it was an issue that needed addressing.\n\nWilliam decided that a holiday would provide him with some thinking time and planned a boys-only sailing trip to Greece with Guy Pelly and some other friends to take place as soon as they left school for the summer. Kate had had a turbulent relationship with Guy and considered him immature and potentially troublesome. It was Guy who used to buy William porn magazines when they were teenagers, and she had heard all about their drink-fueled weekends at Highgrove. There was also a rumor among their friends that William and Guy, after a night of heavy drinking at Club H, the basement rec room with a bar at Highgrove, had covered one of their girlfriends in chocolate ice cream, which they then licked off, and then there was the occasion when Guy challenged William to a midnight swim at their friend James Tollemache\u2019s 21st-birthday party at Helmingham Hall, in Suffolk. They had both been drinking heavily, but that didn\u2019t stop them from stripping down to their boxer shorts, diving in, and swimming a lap of the murky moat that surrounds the Tollemaches\u2019 country estate, where the Queen is a regular guest. It seemed that wherever there was trouble Guy was not far away, and Kate was wary of him. She was annoyed, if not surprised, when she found out that Guy had arranged for an all-female crew for the yacht. So she packed her bags and headed home to Berkshire to spend the summer with her family.\n\nA number of things had caused her to question William\u2019s commitment, although she had not raised them with him yet. One was William\u2019s friendship with an American heiress named Anna Sloan, whom he had met through mutual friends at Edinburgh University, where Anna was studying. Anna had lost her father, businessman George Sloan, in a tragic shooting accident on the family\u2019s 360-acre estate in Nashville, and she and William had bonded over the loss of their parents. When William accepted an invitation from Anna to accompany her and a group of friends to Tennessee for a holiday before he went to Greece, it hurt Kate deeply. She suspected William might have feelings for the 22-year-old heiress. However, according to her friends, Anna was not romantically interested in William, and the friendship was never anything more than just that.\n\nAnd then there was William\u2019s budding relationship with another stunning heiress, Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe. While Kate was girl-next-door pretty, Isabella had cover-girl looks, a title, and a stately pile to boot. That summer William visited the Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe family home in Chelsea to see her. Isabella, daughter of banking heiress Lady Mary Gaye Curzon, was single at the time. Sadly for William, she had no aspirations to date him and despite his amorous advances declared that she was not interested.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate had accepted an invitation to spend a fortnight in France at Fergus Boyd\u2019s family holiday home in the Dordogne with some friends from St. Andrews. Among the group were Kate\u2019s friends Olivia Bleasdale and Ginny Fraser. She had not told them about the trial separation, but from her downcast mood her friends guessed, and one evening she confided to them that she and William were taking a break. \u201cShe got quite drunk on white wine and really let her guard down,\u201d recalled one of the group. \u201cShe was debating whether or not she should text or call him. She said how sad she was and how much she was missing William, but she never mentioned it after that.\u201d\n\nBy November they were back at St. Andrews, although they had yet to reconcile their differences. I had reported the news of their separation that summer, and tellingly there was no denial from Clarence House. Privately, William again complained to friends that he was feeling claustrophobic and already thinking ahead to the summer after graduation, when he was planning to return to Kenya to see Jecca Craig, another fly in the ointment as far as Kate was concerned. \u201cThe last thing William wants is a high-profile split in the crucial months leading up to his finals,\u201d I was told at the time by a source close to William. On the advice of her mother, Kate gave William some breathing space. It was made all the harder because they were living together, but instead of spending weekends in St. Andrews or traveling to Balmoral, Kate would return home to be with her parents.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6542762b432fe5be4ff55a9e/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fe7ae3f9f2d6c81700a52c/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6566170fa07f97a6dc41374c/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cbf68cba5e6f1344ad4d72/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6564f6a6bb312f1f6321c521/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6564ff093797179b83d7d2ed/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655274024562f3d29015ecce/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660f10fa28999da8edabc8/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65565b8e571dd1d01bf1d96f/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cbf68cba5e6f1344ad4d72/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cbf68cba5e6f1344ad4d72/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Katie Nicholl"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/12/william-and-kate-201012", "title": "Wills and the Real Girl", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Royal expert Katie Nicholl surveys the breakups, the other women, and the growing bond between a future King and a country girl.", "id": "54cc225a0a5930502f5fb97b", "keywords": "royals,magazine,archive,kate middleton,prince william,society,royal watch", "news_keywords": "royals,magazine,archive,kate middleton,prince william,society,royal watch", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "54cc225a0a5930502f5fb97b", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Royal expert Katie Nicholl surveys the breakups, the other women, and the growing bond between a future King and a country girl.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cbf68cba5e6f1344ad4d72/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/image.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cbf68cba5e6f1344ad4d72/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/image.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Royal expert Katie Nicholl surveys the breakups, the other women, and the growing bond between a future King and a country girl.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cbf68cba5e6f1344ad4d72/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Wills and the Real Girl", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2010/12/william-and-kate-201012"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2010-11-04T04:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2010-11-04T04:00:00.000Z", "author": "Katie Nicholl"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Royal expert Katie Nicholl surveys the breakups, the other women, and the growing bond between a future King and a country girl.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cbf68cba5e6f1344ad4d72/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Wills and the Real Girl"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cbf68cba5e6f1344ad4d72/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/image.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1288843200.0, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
