Pitt and Jolie are parents to 16-year-old Maddox, 14-year-old Pax, 13-year-old Zahara, 11-year-old Shiloh and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.\n\n\u201cBrad tries to maintain a safe environment for the children, so that when they visit they stay home,\u201d the source says. \"When the children are visiting, they are usually accompanied by bodyguards and nannies. The house is basically on lockdown. He wants his time with his children to be private.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrad really enjoys time with his kids,\u201d the source adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a really important time for him. The kids are his life. They mean everything to him.\u201d\n\nOur source says the actor likes to stay close to his home in Los Angeles, after wrapping up his latest project, the sci-fi film Ad Astra.\n\n\u201cBrad is very much a homebody,\u201d the source notes.\n\nAs for his current relationship with Jolie, according to the source, the two remain amicable for the sake of their children. Things are \"civil\" between them, the source shares, with their children's well-being continuing to be their main focus.\n\nET spoke with 42-year-old Jolie on Tuesday at the National Board of Review Annual Awards Gala in New York City, where she brought along Zahara and Shiloh, as well as her close friend, human rights activist Loung Ung.\n\n\"I'm with a woman I admire very much, and two other women I admire very much,\" she said in praise of her dates.\n\nWatch the sweet moment below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n\n\n", "images": ["http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fangelina_jolie_gettyimages_860354092.jpg%3Fh%3D1d41ab3d&w=256&q=75", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fbrad_pitt_gettyimages_902019514.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/brad_pitt_gettyimages_902019514.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2013-07/640_brad_pitt_angelina_jolie_20130729_ishii_175002506.jpg?width=640", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fgettyimages-467950672.jpg%3Fh%3D70ec2e8b&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/brad_pitt_gettyimages_902019514.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/inside-brad-pitts-home-visits-his-kids-exclusive-94025", "title": "Inside Brad Pitt's Home Visits With His Kids (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/brad_pitt_gettyimages_902019514.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Brad Pitt is working hard to maintain a good relationship with his children, a source tells ET.", "title": "Inside Brad Pitt's Home Visits With His Kids (Exclusive)", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/inside-brad-pitts-home-visits-his-kids-exclusive-94025", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Brad Pitt is working hard to maintain a good relationship with his children, a source tells ET.", "twitter": {"description": "Brad Pitt is working hard to maintain a good relationship with his children, a source tells ET.", "title": "Inside Brad Pitt's Home Visits With His Kids (Exclusive)", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/inside-brad-pitts-home-visits-his-kids-exclusive-94025", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/brad_pitt_gettyimages_902019514.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Inside Brad Pitt's Home Visits With His Kids (Exclusive) | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Brad Pitt", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
