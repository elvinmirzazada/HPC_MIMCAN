George Clooney was \"sedated,\" the couple joked, while mom and babies were fine.\n\nGeorge and Amal Clooney are now parents, having welcomed their twins, a boy and a girl, on Tuesday.\n\n\"Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,\" said their publicist Stan Rosenfield, who jokingly added that \"George is sedated and should recover in a few days.\"\n\nThe couple join a host of celebrity families with twins, including Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony - and, very soon, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z.\n\nGeorge Clooney, the 56-year-old Oscar-winning actor, and Amal Alamuddin, a 39-year-old human rights lawyer, married in Italy in 2014 after meeting through a mutual friend. Ella and Alexander are their first children.\n\nSocial media users were quick to chime in on the couple's choice of traditional names, as opposed to the unusual names often chosen by celebrities.\n\nPhotos of the Clooney twins have not yet been released.\n\nThe next highly anticipated celebrity birth will be singer Beyonc\u00e9 and rapper Jay Z's twins. Though they have not made their due date public, the birth is expected to take place imminently.\n\nClick through the gallery below for more celebrities with twins.\n\nkbm/eg (AFP, AP)", "images": ["https://static.dw.com/image/39136521_6.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.dw.com/image/39136521_6.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.dw.com/en/amal-and-george-clooney-welcome-twins/a-39139204", "title": "Amal and George Clooney welcome twins \u2013 DW \u2013 06", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "theme-color": "#000000", "description": "Ella and Alexander were born to the celebrity couple Tuesday morning - one of the most hotly anticipated births since the Jolie-Pitt twins.
