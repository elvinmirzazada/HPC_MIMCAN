The gorgeous singer showed up to one of the music\u2019s biggest nights with her beau Hassan Jameel. \u201cDrake thought Rihanna looked incredibly sexy at the Grammys,\u201d a source close to the hip hop star EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. \u201cHe did not think she looked pregnant at all, just healthy, happy and really sexy. Watching her dance and shaking her body all over the stage really turned him on, he was totally into it. Drake was shocked and surprised over the subsequent pregnancy rumors that followed her big appearance.\u201d Woah! It sounds like Drake is still hooked on RiRi and we can definitely see why! The talented star is known for having confidence in her body and it sure showed during her incredible energetic Grammys performance of \u201cWild Thoughts.\u201d\n\nAlthough speculation of a pregnancy soared after Rihanna\u2019s performance, she has yet to publicly comment about it. She is, however, reportedly laughing it off and having the time of her life despite what others think of her weight. Drake may have had great feelings about checking Rihanna out at the Grammys but it quickly turned into disappointment when he found out she was still with Hassan. \u201cHe was also disappointed to hear that things between Rihanna and Hassan are still stable and that he was in NYC with her,\u201d the source continued. \u201cDrake still finds Rihanna really sexy, thinks they have great chemistry together and feels like they will get together again one day, hopefully soon.\u201d\n\nDrake and Rihanna have a long history of a complicated on-again, off-again relationship that started around 2009 when they were first spotted together at a bowling alley, according to E! News. From friends to collaborators to lovers, these two have had tons of experience being together so it\u2019s not surprising that Drake would feel such a connection to the beauty. Whether or not they\u2019ll end up together again is yet to be seen but it\u2019s good to know Drizzy can still appreciate all RiRi has to offer!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Rihanna could be pregnant?
