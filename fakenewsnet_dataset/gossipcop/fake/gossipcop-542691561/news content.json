She later established a solo career with her debut album Dangerously in Love, becoming one of music's top-selling artists with sold-out tours and a slew of awards. Knowles has also starred in several films, including Dream Girls. She married hip-hop recording artist Jay-Z in 2008 and the couple has three children. She also holds the record for most Grammy wins ever by a female artist with 28.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She started singing at an early age, competing in local talent shows and winning many of these events by impressing audiences with her singing and dancing abilities.\n\nDestiny's Child\n\nTeaming up with her cousin Kelly Rowland and two classmates, Knowles formed an all-female singing group. Her father, Matthew Knowles, served as the band's manager. The group went through some name and line-up changes before landing a record deal in 1997 with Columbia Records. Destiny's Child soon became one of the most popular R&B acts, with the release of their first, self-titled album. Gaining momentum, the group scored its first No. 1 single on the pop charts with \"Bills, Bills, Bills,\" off their second album. The recording also featured another smash hit, \"Say My Name.\"\n\nWhile enjoying her group's success, Knowles began exploring other projects. She made her acting debut in 2001 with a starring role in Carmen: A Hip Hopera. She then co-starred with Mike Myers in the Austin Powers spy parody Goldmember the following year.\n\nKelly Rowland, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Michelle Williams performing at Super Bowl XLVII.

The recording became a huge success for her both commercially and critically. It sold millions of copies and won five Grammy Awards. On the album, Knowles worked with a number of different artists, including Missy Elliott, Sean Paul and Jay-Z. She was rumored to be dating Jay-Z around this time, but the couple did not publicly acknowledge their relationship.\n\nDestiny's Child released their last studio album, Destiny Fulfilled, in 2004, and officially broke up the following year.\n\nOn her own, Knowles continued to enjoy great success. Her second studio album, 2006's B'Day featured such hits as \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Deja Vu.\" On the big screen, she starred opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jaime Foxx and Eddie Murphy in Dreamgirls. The film was adapted from the hit Broadway musical of the same name.\n\nMarriage to Jay-Z\n\nIn 2008, Knowles married rapper and music mogul Jay-Z in a small, private ceremony in New York City. Among the guests sighted at the wedding were Knowles' mother, Tina Knowles; father, Matthew; sister, Solange; Destiny's Child members Rowland and Michelle Williams; and friend Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nThe newlywed continued to work as hard as ever, promoting her latest effort, I am... Sasha Fierce (2008). Knowles scored two big hits off the album \u2014 \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and \"If I Were a Boy.\" She also returned to the big screen that year, starring as R&B legend Etta James in Cadillac Records. The following January, Knowles sang James' trademark song, \"At Last,\" for President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama at his inaugural ball.\n\nIn addition to acting and performing, Knowles ran a clothing line called House of Dereon with her mother. She also launched her own fragrance, Heat, in 2010. Throughout her career, Knowles has served as a spokesperson and model for several other brands, including L'Oreal and Tommy Hilfiger.\n\nKnowles found herself under fire after performing a private concert for Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi on New Year's Eve in 2010. She later donated her fee from the event to help victims of the Haitian earthquake. According to some reports, Knowles said that her father had been responsible for arranging the Libyan concert. She decided to drop her father as her manager in March 2011. Later that year, Knowles reached the top of the album charts with her latest solo release, 4.\n\nIn January 2013, Knowles generated some negative headlines for her performance at President Obama's second inauguration in Washington, D.C. She was criticized for reportedly pre-recording a version of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and lip-syncing to her own track during the outdoor ceremony. Despite wide media coverage, in the days following the incident, Knowles did not publicly address the controversy.\n\nNot long after, prior to her appearance at Super Bowl XLVII, Knowles performed the song live at a press conference. She explained to reporters that she had used a \"backing track\" at the inauguration, adding that she would \"absolutely be singing live\" at the NFL's biggest event of the year, according to The Huffington Post.\n\nIndeed, Knowles more than redeemed herself in the public eye at the Super Bowl on February 3, 2013. During the event's halftime show, she took the stage and wowed the crowd, joined by her former Destiny's Child bandmates Rowland and Williams for parts of her performance. Knowles also announced that her next major tour would start in the spring of 2013.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Jay-Z at the 2017 Grammy Awards Photo: Lester Cohen/Getty Images for NARAS\n\nAwards, Accolades and Surprise Album\n\nAt the 2010 Grammy Awards, Knowles walked away with six honors \u2014 the most wins in a single night by a female artist.

In 2011, she made the Forbes Top 10 list of entertainment's highest-earning women. By 2013, Knowles had won 16 Grammys.\n\nKnowles broke records once again on December 13, 2013, with her fifth studio album, self-titled Beyonc\u00e9. The album surprised fans and critics alike, as no promotion for the album had been announced prior to its release. The record, which Knowles called a \"visual album,\" was released exclusively on iTunes, with physical discs available for purchase after December 18. The record-breaking album sold more than 800,000 copies throughout the weekend it was released alone.\n\nThe collection \u2014 which was the fastest-selling album ever distributed by iTunes\u2014also marked Knowles' fifth studio album to debut at No. 1, making her the first woman to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with her first five albums.

Although she lost the coveted Album of the Year Grammy to Adele, she did take home two awards, for Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best Music Video.\n\nSolange and Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles Photo: Josh Brasted/Getty Images\n\nCoachella, OTR II and 'Everything Is Love'\n\nIn March 2018, reports surfaced that Knowles was working on new music and preparing to hit the road with Jay-Z.
