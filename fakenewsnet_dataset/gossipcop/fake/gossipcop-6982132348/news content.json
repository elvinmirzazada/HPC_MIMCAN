{"url": "www.gq.com/story/chris-pratt-cover-story", "text": "When I arrive at the house in the Hollywood Hills that Chris Pratt shares with his wife, the comic actress Anna Faris, and their 2 1/2-year-old son, Jack, Pratt has just returned from a long early-morning bike ride. He is getting in shape for three forthcoming movies and also preparing for a triathlon in a few weeks\u2019 time, something he was talked into by a good friend, a Navy Seal whom he met while making Zero Dark Thirty. This is the sort of thing you might expect from the new Chris Pratt\u2014the one who posts six-pack selfies on Instagram, the one whose last movie, Guardians of the Galaxy, grossed nearly $800 million worldwide and re-invented him from a bumbling, chubby sitcom sidekick into everyone\u2019s favorite new movie star (a status he hopes to bolster with this month\u2019s Jurassic World). In other words, the one who has undergone a parallel physical and professional transformation without obvious precedent in Hollywood.\n\nPratt\u2019s road here, to this career and this body, has been unlikely and meandering. When he first auditioned for movies in his early twenties he would try out for all kinds of roles, but he soon fell into the first of the two stereotypical parts that would fill up his next decade. \"Typically, I was getting typecast as the bad boyfriend. The boyfriend of the girl who you hope ends up with the guy you like. That was my bread and butter for a long time,\" he says. He\u2019s had a quick shower and has lit a cigar\u2014some combination of late-morning pleasure and character prep for his next movie, The Magnificent Seven. \"Looking back, I think I know why. Physically, I looked like an asshole.\"\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\n\"I looked like the guy\u2014like Johnny in The Karate Kid, you know?\"\n\nSlowly he worked to at least make these roles funnier. \"I always had thought my strongest ability was improvisational comedy,\" he says. \"I was always adding stuff to scenes and the directors would be like, \u2019Come on, man, no, don\u2019t do that.\u2019 And then that stuff would make the cut. And I was like, \u2019I knew it! I knew I was funnier than that stupid fucking director, and he didn\u2019t know what the fuck he was talking about! I knew it!\u2019 \"\n\nSoon Pratt was actually being cast for his comic instincts. And with the greater emphasis on comedy came a gradual physical transformation, one that became unavoidably apparent to him as he watched himself on-screen early in the second season of Parks and Recreation. \"I saw myself and I thought, \u2019Wow, I\u2019m getting fat.\u2019 And then immediately I was like, \u2019This is the funniest...\u2019 I was making myself laugh. I was: \u2019That\u2019s where it\u2019s at. There\u2019s no one doing that. No one being like a super-confident dumb fat guy.\u2019 So I started.\" He told the showrunner that he wanted to get even larger, and was enthusiastically encouraged to do so. \"So I just got fatter,\" he says, \"and the laughs kept coming, and it was funnier and funnier. And in that moment I was like, \u2019Oh great, I found my niche\u2014this is paying better than the asshole-boyfriend parts.\u2019 \"\n\nIf you read or watch the interviews Chris Pratt did in the comedy years, he played the part of the happy plump man to perfection. But he may just have been fooling us and fooling himself at the same time. \"I\u2019m sure I was the first guy in line to buy that line of bullshit,\" he says now. \"I also understood that there was value to it\u2014my comedic nature understood the irony of a super-happy fat sweaty guy who is completely confident and accepting of who he was. That\u2019s fascinating to people. I mean, I was never as big as Chris Farley, but you look at Chris Farley\u2014that\u2019s what made him so magical. Because other people look just like him, and they\u2019re like, \u2019Why is this guy not crippled with self-doubt? Fuck, that\u2019s awesome. I wish I could feel that way.\u2019 Well, I don\u2019t think Chris Farley did feel that way. I think he killed himself with drugs and alcohol and buried himself in an addiction to hide the fact that he didn\u2019t feel what he was projecting on the outside. I think that\u2019s often the case with comedians.\"\n\nIn the past year or two, Pratt, who turns 36 this month, has become more candid about casting those years in a less joyful light, explaining that the highlights of his days were the eating and drinking but that the rest wasn\u2019t so good, that he felt physically and mentally sluggish and \"didn\u2019t feel too great about who I was.\"\n\nHe nods when I bring this up and elaborates. \"My bones ached, I had cardiovascular issues, I was unhealthy, I was feeling rotten.\"\n\nSo for instance, would you openly discuss with your wife, say: \"I wish my body wasn\u2019t like this\u2014I don\u2019t want to be like this\"?\n\n\"Yeah. But she was so okay with it. Probably in many ways preferred me that way.\"\n\nWhy?\n\n\"I think I was outwardly having more fun. I was more fun to be around, probably. That image that I was casting, to convince people that I was okay, was a really fun person to hang around. Now I have less fun. I focus more. She doesn\u2019t get to cook for me the way she used to.\" He laughs. \"I was like a great pet fat guy.\"\n\nDoes she actively complain that you\u2019re less fun?\n\n\"No, she understands and she just supports me regardless. I think that part of her is hedging her bets that one day I\u2019ll be fat again, and she\u2019ll say, \u2019Remember, honey, I always told you I preferred you this way.\u2019 She\u2019s probably just playing the long game.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14 Chevron Chevron Subtle\u2014not costumey\u2014epaulets make this shirt special. _Shirt, $108, by Banana Republic Tie, $150, by Alexander Olch Tie bar, $15, by The Tie Bar Pants, $790, by Louis Vuitton_ Location (throughout), The Station Joshua Tree, California\n\nAn aside about nudity: What were you like as a young kid?\n\n\"Obnoxious. I was obnoxious, really hyperactive, disruptive...but also Dad was very, very strict, so if I got yelled at, I would stay silent for a long period of time. I was really sensitive. I cried a lot. I was a crybaby for a long time. And kind of perverted. I was like a little perv.\"\n\nIn what way?", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/656267c718f99454105f6908/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/coupons/static/shop/47058/logo/peacock-tv-coupon.png", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/55833e253655c24c6c95f1a8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/copilot-style-201506-1431444034254_chris-pratt-gq-june-2015-03.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/65565bfbf5cbf47e8834fe1e/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6553a112f1b24408112c10f9/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/561c0bcee8a83977119f8388/4:3/pass/Screen%2520Shot%25202015-10-12%2520at%25203.33.54%2520PM.png", "https://www.gq.com/coupons/static/shop/46737/logo/Samsung-discount-code.png", "http://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/55833e213655c24c6c95f1a4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/copilot-style-201506-1431444034252_chris-pratt-gq-june-2015-01.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6552585d2146bea030fc1d22/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/65495a09d966089a410a1d8a/master/h_120%2Cc_limit/CountdownTicker_5x2_TS_v2.png", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6560fc35cef9f2854e46452f/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5582c953e52bc4b477a9d88c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/entertainment-2015-06-chris-pratt-june-cover-409.jpg", "https://www.gq.com/coupons/static/shop/39688/logo/Wayfair_Logo-GQ__1_.png", "https://media.gq.com/photos/564b5985fc144926178b300c/4:3/pass/amy-schumer-obama-gift.jpg", "http://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/564276266ff00fb522b0741b/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/obama-tout.jpg", "https://www.gq.com/coupons/static/shop/38348/logo/michaels-coupon-logo.png", "https://www.gq.com/coupons/static/shop/45452/logo/shein-coupon-code.png", "https://media.gq.com/photos/55833e2309f0bee564416d35/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/copilot-style-201506-1431444034253_chris-pratt-gq-june-2015-02.jpg", "https://www.gq.com/coupons/static/shop/38333/logo/Asos_trans_back.png"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Chris Heath", "Bill Simmons"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/chris-pratt-cover-story", "title": "Chris Pratt Cover Story: From Dadbod Sidekick to Rock-Hard Hero", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "The ripped star of Jurassic World reflects on what became of his pudgier, goofier self", "id": "5582c9541177d66d68d589fa", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5582c9541177d66d68d589fa", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The ripped star of Jurassic World reflects on what became of his pudgier, goofier self\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The ripped star of Jurassic World reflects on what became of his pudgier, goofier self", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg", "site_name": "GQ", "title": "Chris Pratt Cover Story: From Dadbod Sidekick to Rock-Hard Hero", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gq.com/story/chris-pratt-cover-story"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2015-05-18T00:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-18T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Heath"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@gqmagazine", "description": "The ripped star of Jurassic World reflects on what became of his pudgier, goofier self", "domain": "https://www.gq.com", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@gqmagazine", "title": "Chris Pratt Cover Story: From Dadbod Sidekick to Rock-Hard Hero"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1431907200.0, "source": "http://www.gq.com", "summary": ""}
