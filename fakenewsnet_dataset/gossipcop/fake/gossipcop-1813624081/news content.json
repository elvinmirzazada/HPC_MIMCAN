The former couple separated in 2013 and were reportedly not on good terms following the split, but things seem to have improved slightly since then.\n\n\u201cKris and Caitlyn interact when they have to for the kids,\u201d an insider told People. \u201cIt\u2019s important for Kylie and Kendall. They can be cordial, but like most exes, they\u2019re never going to be best friends.\u201d\n\nEarl Gibson III // Getty Images\n\nAs People points out, the family of four has reunited on several occasions, including Kylie's 21st birthday party earlier this month. \"It wasn\u2019t a happy, laughing interaction between Kris and Caitlyn,\" a source told the site. \"It was more like, this is a moment where we\u2019re coming together for the kids. It was very brief.\"\n\nCaitlyn, who is said to have a strained relationship with stepdaughter Kim Kardashian, was seen in the KKW Beauty mogul's Snapchat story during Kylie's birthday.\n\nAlthough the cameo hinted that the two are now on amicable terms, a source told People that Kim, Kourtney, and Khlo\u00e9 ignored Caitlyn at the celebration.\n\n\u201cThings are still frosty between them,\u201d the insider said. \u201cThere are too many hurt feelings between Kris and Caitlyn and the older girls.\u201d\n\nDespite the friction between Caitlyn and Kim, Caitlyn and Kanye West seem to be on speaking terms. The rapper (and Kim's husband) recently tweeted a screenshot of texts he received from Jenner, where she thanked him for sending Yeezy looks to her rumored girlfriend Sophia Hutchins.\n\n\"So awesome. Your [sic] welcome,\" Kanye replied.", "images": ["http://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/x.3361b6d.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed",
