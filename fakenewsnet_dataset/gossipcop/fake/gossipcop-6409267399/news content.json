a drug battle.\n\n\"Brad did not go to rehab,\" the source told ET on Wednesday, a few hours after Radar Online published an article claiming the Allied star was \"secretly getting help\" for \"his issues.\"\n\n\n\nWATCH: Brad Pitt Steps Out Amid Reports He's Seeing His Kids More\n\n\"Cannot for the life of me understand what they mean by 'bombshell' investigation,\" the source added, specifically addressing a line in the article that alleges Pitt \"spent a whopping $15,000 on a five-night sober retreat\" in a private suite inside Casa Del Mar -- a resort in Santa Monica,

support for their six children, Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 8, the source told ET the actor's team is not aware of such demands.\n\n\"[Brad's team] is strictly following the privacy agreement between the two of them,\" the source said. \"[Brad's team] has never spoken about the kids and won't be starting now.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Pitt, 53, and Jolie, 41, released their first joint statement since their September split, sharing that they've both signed agreements to keep all of their court documents private.\n\n\n\nWATCH: Angelina Jolie,
