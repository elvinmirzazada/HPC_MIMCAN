Brown \u2014 but don\u2019t call it a bromance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I like the word bromance. People seem to like that word,\u201d Hartley, 40, exclusively tells Us Weekly. \u201cI love those guys though. We all get along. They are two of my best friends. I really do love both those dudes. They\u2019re great.\u201d\n\nRelated: Milo Ventimiglia's Hotness Evolution Milo Ventimiglia has been steaming up our screens for more than a decade. And he\u2019s only gotten hotter with age!\n\nHartley and Brown, 41, play Kevin and Randall, respectively, on the NBC drama, with Ventimiglia, 40, as their dad, Jack Pearson. The pair don\u2019t share too much air time with the Gilmore Girls alum (Jack died when their characters were in high school), but the trio take advantage of their time off-camera.\n\n\u201cI know the show gets really heavy sometimes and gets really sad and deep \u2014 but in-between takes sometimes that\u2019s what keeps you going into the next take is that you have to sort of release a laugh,\u201d Hartley says. \u201cAnd those two dudes make me laugh all day long.\u201d\n\nDuring some of those \u201cheavy\u201d scenes, Jack often recites heartwarming speeches to his children \u2014 including Kate (Chrissy Metz). Hartley says that he sometimes can relate to the fictional patriarch.\n\nRelated: Fictional TV Hometowns If only it really existed! Sometimes a TV show's setting becomes just another character. Check out some of our favorite small screen fictional hometowns, including Dawson's Creek's Capeside, Gilmore Girls' Stars Hollow, and more!\n\n\u201cI think Milo does a great job portraying a good father who wants the best for his kids and wants his kids to be better than him. And every time Isabella will do anything I always want it to be better than the way I did it,\u201d he says of his 13-year-old daughter. \u201cBeing an actor you go through this thing where you want to be the best and I think in life in general you go through this thing where you want to be the best always, constantly. And then you have a child and the only thing you want is for your child to be a lot better than you ever were. I feel a lot of the way he handles things. There\u2019s a calmness about him. I try to be as calm and as reassuring and a rock to my daughter as I possibly can be. I try to teach her everything that I never knew when I was her age and I try to give her all the advantages and the things that I didn\u2019t have when I was her age.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Bromances See Hollywood's inseparable wingmen\n\nOf course, some of Jack\u2019s memories with his family and wife Rebecca (Mandy Moore) lead to many tears. While fans cry at home, Hartley jokes that it\u2019s Metz who is the one with a tissue box on set.\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
