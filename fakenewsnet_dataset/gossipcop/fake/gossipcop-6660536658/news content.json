A recent cover of the publication featured a photo of Vergara dancing with another man with the headline \u201cIt\u2019s Over!\u201d\n\nThe image showed Vergara without her wedding ring \u2014 but both the \u201cModern Family\u201d actress and her husband say the picture was photoshopped.\n\n\u201cBig surprise everyone but Star created a fake story and then photo shopped my wife\u2019s engagement ring off of her finger in order to sell magazines,\u201d Manganiello, 40, wrote in a heated Instagram post. \u201cThey are run by malicious trash. Do the world a favor and don\u2019t buy their garbage.\u201d\n\nJoe Manganiello and Sofia Vergara each blasted a report claiming they had broken up.\n\nMeanwhile, Vergara, 44, shared a similar sentiment while contending that an unedited version of the photo on the cover \u2014 which shows Vergara dancing with another man \u2014 is on social media which proves she was indeed wearing a ring that night.\n\n\u201cThe editor of this magazine is an idiot if he is going to have my ring removed to created a \u2018fake\u2019 \u2018news\u2019 he should have made sure that he removed from social media all the other pictures of that award night in Rome where Im wearing it,\u201d she wrote in her own Instagram post.\n\nShe went on to say that the man she\u2019s dancing with in that photo is a producer working on her upcoming suspense thriller, \u201cBent,\u201d who spent Easter at her home last month.\n\nA spokesperson for American Media, Inc., which publishes Star, refuted Vergara\u2019s allegation that they photoshopped a photo of her to remove a ring.\n\n\u201cAlthough Ms. Vergara has claimed that Star removed her wedding ring from a photograph on its cover that was taken during \u201cthat award night in Rome,\u201d the photograph in which Ms. Vergara is pictured without her wedding ring was taken in Los Angeles on April 15, after she returned from Rome, and appears on page 34 of the magazine,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nVergara and Manganiello have been together since July 2014 and married in November 2015.", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/05/04/HTX5KLNMDTIEHY334JCP2RRI4A.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NYDN-LOGO-WHITE-J.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/05/04/HTX5KLNMDTIEHY334JCP2RRI4A.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sblendorio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/05/04/sofia-vergara-and-joe-manganiello-slam-magazine-report-claiming-she-cheated-and-they-broke-up/", "title": "Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello slam magazine report claiming she cheated and they broke up", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello say they're doing just fine \u2014 despite a tabloid magazine report suggesting their marriage is in shambles.", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello slam magazine report claiming she cheated and they broke up", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/05/04/sofia-vergara-and-joe-manganiello-slam-magazine-report-claiming-she-cheated-and-they-broke-up/", "description": "Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello say they\u2019re doing just fine \u2014 despite a tabloid magazine report suggesting their marriage is in shambles.
