Sure Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin's got engaged, but also, Kylie Jenner has returned to her old face.\n\nThe signature pout that helped the reality star launch her beauty empire Kylie Cosmetics\u2014featuring the highly-coveted Kylie Lip Kits\u2014is no longer, according to a photo the beauty mogul posted to her Instagram on Sunday.\n\n\"[S]he looks like the old Kylie here and idk why,\" one fan commented under the picture of Jenner and her best friend Anastasia Karanikolaou, to which Kylie responded, \"i got rid of all my filler,\" adding two shocked emojis and a smiling face emoji. Another fan praised Jenner for embracing an all natural look, writing, \"YESSS KYLIE!!! you look stunning w more natural looking lips. i stan this we STAN,\" with Kylie replying to the fan with a few heart face emojis.\n\nInstagram/Kylie Jenner\n\nJenner confirmed that her pumped up pout (which inspired the #KylieJennerChallenge, in which fans would use small cups to plump their lips) was a result of lip injections during an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians in 2015.\n\nA year later in an interview with Complex, Jenner admitted that she may have gone too far with the lip injections. \"When you first get them done, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, it could be a little bit bigger on that side.\u2019 I\u2019d go back and be like, \u2018They went down\u2019 and think they could be bigger. But I went too far. It was very painful,\" she explained. \"It\u2019s annoying to hear every day that you\u2019re just this fake, plastic person when you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\n", "images":
