Years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends star for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source told In Touch exclusively.Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now, he\u2019s \u201cin touch with emotions and his true self like never before,\u201d the source says.And it seems like this self-awareness comes with some great realisations. \u201cHe has come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,\u201d the source adds. \u201cAnd while he\u2019s not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he\u2019s seeing everything more clearly.\u201dHowever, these realisations are obviously far too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now.And while Brad would \u201cnever dream of\u201d ruining his ex\u2019s new marriage, he \u201cwould take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.\u201dIf they can\u2019t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits, In Touch further reported.\u201cThey worked well together\u201d when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad told In Touch. \u201cHe wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.\u201dThat kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider states she wants in on \u201cprestige projects\u201d under his production banner. \u201cShe\u2019d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress \u2014 something that\u2019s evaded both her and Angelina.\u201d\u201cHe still considers Jen the love of his life,\u201d the source concluded.Have something to add to the story?
