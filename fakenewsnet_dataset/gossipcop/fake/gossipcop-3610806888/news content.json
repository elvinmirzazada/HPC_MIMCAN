Who\u2019s the girl?\u201d It featured images of the actor with a mysterious brunette stepping onto a private jet. However, the story didn\u2019t phase the actor too much, and he fired back with the perfect response:\n\n\u201cYou should have heard how upset Mila was that I spent the day with our cousin,\u201d he wrote on Twitter Sunday. \u201cSorry aunt Jodie these magazines lack integrity.\u201d\n\nYou should have heard how upset Mila was that I spent the day with our cousin. Sorry aunt Jodie these magazines lack integrity. pic.twitter.com/tvKdGoqRnx \u2014 ashton kutcher (@aplusk) July 9, 2017\n\nA few hours later, the former \u201cThat 70s Show\u201d star shared another tweet, encouraging fans to fight battles that will \u201cchange the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to fight battles they might as well be the ones to change the world,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Kutcher has had a problem with Star magazine and the publication suggesting he is a cheater. In 2010, he took to Twitter to slam the magazine for claiming he was cheating on his then-wife, Demi Moore.\n\n\u201cI think Star magazine calling me a \u2018cheater\u2019 qualifies as defamation of character,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI hope my lawyer agrees.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AshtonKutcher.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/leo.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/igeer-1.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AshtonKutcher.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/charlamange-kal-penn.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Saucy-Santana-e1701158793498.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AshtonKutcher.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Loree Seitz", "Kayla Cobb", "Lucas Manfredi", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/ashton-kutcher-calls-out-tabloid-for-cheating-story-these-magazines-lack-integrity/", "title": "Ashton Kutcher Calls Out Tabloid for Cheating Story: \u2018These Magazines Lack Integrity\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ashton Kutcher Calls Out Tabloid for Cheating Story: 'These Magazines Lack Integrity' - TheWrap", "description": "\"You should have heard how upset Mila was that I spent the day with our cousin,\" actor tweets in wry comeback", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/ashton-kutcher-calls-out-tabloid-for-cheating-story-these-magazines-lack-integrity/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AshtonKutcher.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-07-10T15:41:10+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Ashton Kutcher Calls Out Tabloid for Cheating Story: \u2018These Magazines Lack Integrity\u2019", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/ashton-kutcher-calls-out-tabloid-for-cheating-story-these-magazines-lack-integrity/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-07-10T08:41:10-07:00", "parsely-section": "news", "parsely-author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "parsely-tags": "ashton_kutcher, demi_moore, mila_kunis, star_magazine", "article-tags": "ashton_kutcher, demi_moore, mila_kunis, star_magazine}", "article-section": "news", "article-categories": "media, news", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499701270.0, "source": "http://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
