But if you go back about 15 years, the actor says he was far from content.\n\n\u201cI spent the \u201890s trying to hide out, trying to duck the full celebrity cacophony. I started to get sick of myself sitting on a couch, holding a joint, hiding out. It started feeling pathetic,\" Pitt tells Parade magazine in this weekend's issue.\n\n\"It became very clear to me that I was intent on trying to find a movie about an interesting life, but I wasn\u2019t living an interesting life myself,\" he continues. \"I think that my marriage [to actress Jennifer Aniston] had something to do with it. Trying to pretend the marriage was something that it wasn\u2019t.\"\n\nThese days, as a parent of six alongside partner Angelina Jolie, Pitt's found a sense of peace.\n\nPhotos of Brad Pitt's romances\n\n\"I put much more emphasis on being a satisfied man. I\u2019m satisfied with making true choices and finding the woman I love, Angie, and building a family that I love so much. A family is a risky venture, because the greater the love, the greater the loss. \u2026 That\u2019s the trade-off. But I\u2019ll take it all,\" the \"Moneyball\" star says.\n\nAnd although his relationship with Jolie has been the subject of gossip and controversy for years, Pitt's confident he made the right choice by building a family with his \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" co-star.\n\nPhoto flashback: See pictures of Brad Pitt through the years\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest, smartest things I ever did was give my kids Angie as their mom,\" he tells Parade. \"She is such a great mom. Oh, man, I\u2019m so happy to have her.\u201d\n\nThe rumor mill may suggest otherwise, but Pitt shoots down suggestions that the pair are at a breaking point.\n\n\"I mean, how many stories have you read that aren\u2019t true, stories about me and Angie being married or fighting or splitting up? And when we don\u2019t split up, there\u2019s a whole new round that we\u2019ve made up and we\u2019re back together again!\" he says. \"We\u2019ll get married when everyone can. We\u2019re not splitting up. And we don\u2019t have a seventh child yet.\"\n\nRead more from Brad Pitt's interview when this weekend's issue of Parade arrives Sunday.", "images":
