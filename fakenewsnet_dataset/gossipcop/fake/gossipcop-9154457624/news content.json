Being that she is a thinner build, when she flexes her muscles that\u2019s when those veins are more pronounced and you can see them more. The vein that you\u2019re seeing on her leg is the great saphenous vein. It starts at the groin and goes down to the ankle. I don\u2019t see anything that would be pause for concern with Angelina.\u201d Well, that\u2019s definitely good news! See some photos of Angelina\u2019s thin frame here.\n\nDr. Lee also shared what kind of veins would be dangerous. \u201cIf her veins were spider-like or if they were bigger bulging veins, then she would need to have those treated, but we typically only see that in larger people and older individuals,\u201d she continued. \u201cFor what she is showing, it\u2019s not symptomatic. She\u2019s just a vascular woman.\u201d\n\nAngelina and her fit body recently made headlines when she graced the Nov. 2017 cover of Bazaar. The mother of six has been keeping busy since her split from Brad Pitt, 53, and keeps proving she\u2019s dedicated to raising her children and staying active in her charitable contributions.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what are your thoughts on what the surgeon had to say?
