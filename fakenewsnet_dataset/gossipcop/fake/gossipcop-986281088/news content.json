He is probably most widely recognized for his music career. Marc is the highest selling salsa artist in history, and to date has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. In 2023, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Anthony at number 167 of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.\n\nEarly Life and Career Beginnings\n\nMarco Antonio Mu\u00f1iz, better known by his stage name Marc Anthony, was born in New York City on September 16, 1968. His mother, Guillermina, was a housewife, and his father, Felipe, was a hospital cafeteria worker and musician. Both of his parents were from Puerto Rico. Anthony grew up in East Harlem, and was raised Roman Catholic. He is the youngest of eight children.\n\nHe began learning music from his father, who taught him how to sing in both Spanish and English. He is actually named after the Mexican singer Marco Antonio Mu\u00f1iz. He began his musical career as a session vocalist for freestyle music and underground New York house music acts, and then was a songwriter and backing vocalist for the pop acts Menudo, and the Latin Rascals. This is around the time that he began going by the name Marc Anthony, to avoid confusion with his namesake. He gained fame by performing a style of salsa that borrowed more heavily from African American and urban genres he listened to growing up.\n\nMusic Career\n\nAnthony's first album, a freestyle music record, \"Rebel\", debuted in 1988 on Bluedog Records. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he worked on a number of projects. He wrote and produced the song \"Boy I've Been Told\" for Sa-Fire, and wrote a duet with Chrissy I-eece called \"You Should Know By Now\" with Little Louie Vega and Todd Terry. He also featured on several freestyle club hits, including \"Ride On The Rhythm\" and \"Time.\"\n\nAfter initially being reluctant to become a salsa musician, he eventually changed his mind and work with RMM Records to release his Spanish-language debut, \"Otra Nota\", in 1993. He followed this up with the album \"Todo a su tiempo\" (1995), which won him a Billboard award for Hot Tropical Artist of the Year, and was nominated for a Grammy. The album has sold more than 800,000 copies, and has been certified Gold in both the United States and in Puerto Rico. He released \"Contra La Coriente\" in 1997. The album's song \"Y Huubo Alguien\" was his first No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks, and was the first song to top the chart by a salsa musician. It also was the first salsa album ever to enter the Billboard 200 chart. He left RMM in 1999, and joined Sony Records.\n\nIn 1999, riding the crossover wave of other Spanish-language artists like Ricky Martin and Enrique Iglesias, Anthony took a shot at the Anglophone market with the English-language album \"Marc Anthony\". It debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200, and went Platinum just six weeks later. Eventually, it was certified triple platinum, and the song \"I Need To Know\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. He has since released the albums \"Libre\" (2001), \"Mended\" (2002), \"Amar Sin Mentiras\" (2004), \"Valio la Pena\" (2004), \"El Cantante\" (2007), \"Iconos\" (2010), \"3.0\" (2013), \"Opus\" (2019), and \"Pa'll\u00e1 Voy\" (2022).\n\nActing\n\nAnthony first ventured into acting with supporting roles in films like \"Hackers\" (1995), \"Big Night\" (1996) and \"The Substitute\" (1996).
