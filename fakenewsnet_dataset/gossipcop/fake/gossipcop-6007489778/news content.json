Scott (real name Jacques Webster) pleaded guilty to the lowest charge and was required to pay $640 in court-associated costs, in addition to $6,825.31 to two people who said they were injured at the concert. The other two misdemeanor charges \u2014 inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a child \u2014 were dismissed.\n\n\u201cObviously, [Scott] would not in any way want a riot to break out at his concert. That would not be good for him as an entertainer,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cTo think that he incited one is ridiculous. We think the police way overcharged him. The prosecutor\u2019s office finally did the right thing \u2014 they made an offer that he agreed to. \u2026 If anyone was hurt, Travis expressed concern from the beginning. He wanted to make sure those people were taken care of.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars at Court Chris Brown isn't the only celeb who has faced a judge.
