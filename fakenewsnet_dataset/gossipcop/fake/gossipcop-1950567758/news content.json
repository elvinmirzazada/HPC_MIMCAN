Click here to get those and more in the PEOPLE Babies newsletter.\n\nA Pregnancy Scare\n\nIn May 2016, just five months after Saint was born, Kardashian West bought three pregnancy tests and took one in a cramped airplane bathroom during a flight, taking to Snapchat to share the experience with her fans.\n\nKim Kardashian/Snapchat\n\n\u201cI\u2019m legit in the airplane bathroom taking a pregnancy test because I\u2019m having a little bit of a scare,\u201d she said in one video.\n\nAfter her frantic message, the star snapped a pic of the clear \u201cnot pregnant\u201d result.\n\nKim Kardashian/Snapchat\n\nThe next day, Kardashian West took to Snapchat yet again, this time to explain her decision to document the experience.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s discuss,\u201d she started. \u201cSome people were asking me why I would Snapchat the pregnancy test on the airplane. And I just thought it was funny, because I\u2019ve been so private before \u2014 and what do I really care if I was pregnant again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get my period this month, so I was just really confused,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t stand to be on a flight for 10 hours not knowing.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Is Trying for a Third Baby \u2014 But Doctors Warn It\u2019s Not Safe\n\nExploring Other Options\n\nA few months later, in a November 2016 episode of KUWTK, Kardashian West broached the possibility of having someone else carry her third child.\n\nKardashian West then met with two fertility specialists, including Dr. Wong, who was on board with the option considering the medical risks of a third pregnancy for the star.\n\n\u201cUsing a surrogate is not an unreasonable option,\u201d he said. \u201cIf our goal is to grow your family like you want to, then a surrogate makes sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the two doctors that I trust have told me it wouldn\u2019t be safe for me to get pregnant again, I have to listen to that,\u201d said Kardashian West. \u201cBut because I don\u2019t know anyone that has been a surrogate or used one, I didn\u2019t really think about that as an option for me.\u201d\n\nKim Kardashian West/Instagram\n\nAt sister Kourtney Kardashian\u2018s suggestion, Kardashian west met with a woman named Natalie who had both carried a pregnancy herself and used a surrogate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more worried because I gave birth to two [children] \u2014 there\u2019s a sense in me that because I went through all that pain for these two babies and that I know we did this together \u2026 There\u2019s no one that would feel your love [like that],\u201d she said. \u201cThey are literally near your heart and inside of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy bond with my kids is so strong,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think my biggest fear if I had a surrogate is: Would I love them the same? That\u2019s the main thing I keep thinking about.\u201d\n\nNatalie reassured the star that the bond is just as strong, and Kardashian West sat down with momager Kris Jenner to discuss the news.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I can\u2019t carry another one,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to explore surrogacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat scares me for you,\u201d said Jenner. \u201cWhat if she gives birth and then grabs the baby and makes a run for it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she can,\u201d said Kardashian West. \u201cAlso, the best thing is I could have a new baby and have no one know and live my life for a good year before we announce it.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Katherine Heigl Reveals the Emotional Way She Told Her Daughters She Was Pregnant\n\nBaby Fever Hits Hard\n\nIn an April episode of the most recent season of KUWTK, the reality star revealed that she and West, 40, are trying to conceive again despite their challenging pregnancies.\n\n\u201cI want my kids to have siblings, but the doctors don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s safe for me,\u201d she said, telling sister Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian that she\u2019s \u201cgoing to try to have one more baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love nothing more than to expand my family and just know that I have this world at home that\u2019s safe,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if for some reason I left this earth sooner than I really wanted to, then my kids would have a support system at home \u2014 so that I know that they would be okay if I wasn\u2019t here.\u201d\n\n\u201cKanye and I have always talked about having more kids,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut after what I went through in Paris, the urgency is even greater.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Kardashian West and her husband had been working hard on their relationship, having finally settled into a good place after enduring a period of marital strain sparked by her Paris robbery last October, followed swiftly by the rapper\u2019s hospitalized for exhaustion in November.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows she had major medical complications during her other two pregnancies,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cBut whenever things are going great with Kanye, Kim talks about having another baby.\u201d (The insider also acknowledged that a third baby would be \u201ca great storyline for the show.\u201d)\n\nSource: Kim Kardashian Instagram\n\nGetting Serious About Surrogacy\n\nIn the same April KUWTK episode, Kardashian West underwent a procedure in an attempt to help her become able to carry another child \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t successful.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t carry anymore kids \u2026 it\u2019s the worst,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI give up.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the star decided it was time to revisit the option of hiring a surrogate.\n\n\u201cKanye was really nervous about the surgery \u2026 but I know he would want to have more kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like surrogacy is the only option for me. Kanye and I are going to look into other options and see what we are comfortable with \u2026 but I\u2019m definitely leaning towards [surrogacy].\u201d\n\n\u201cI always knew surrogacy was an option \u2014 now it\u2019s my reality,\u201d she eventually concluded. \u201cWhatever is meant to be will be.\u201d\n\nA Plan in Motion\n\nIn June 2017, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that the stars had hired a surrogate. TMZ was the first to report the news.\n\nIt\u2019s a Girl!\n\nThe soon-to-be mother of three told host Ellen DeGeneres that her 4-year-old daughter North had taken to calling the unborn child, \u201cBaby Sister\u201dduring an October 2017 appearance on the talk show. \u201cMy daughter thinks she\u2019s tricky,\u201d Kardashian West said. \u201cWe had a baby shower over the weekend, and I thought, \u2018You know, I really do want to have a baby shower because I want [North] to feel that something\u2019s coming and for her to really understand it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA New Experience\n\nWhile she was excited to share the news with the rest of the Kardashian crew, Kardashian West admitted the situation felt different than when she was pregnant the first two times. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird when it\u2019s not you, so I don\u2019t know whether I should start eating donuts and celebrate like I would like old times or just go to the gym,\u201d Kardashian West told sister Kourtney on a December 2017 episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. \u201cI\u2019m totally gonna forget and then a month before I\u2019m gonna be like holly sh\u2014, we need to get a nursery.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s Here!\n\nThe couple\u2019s second daughter has arrived via surrogate, Kardashian West shared via her website on January 16, 2018. The baby girl was born Jan. 15, at 12:47 a.m., weighing 7 lbs., 6 oz. \u201cKanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,\u201d she wrote in a post titled \u2018She\u2019s Here!\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care.\u201d", "images":
