There's a major double standard when she FaceTimes with her dad Tristan Thompson, she said.\n\n\"With her dad, she smiles, and her tongue sticks out, and it's like why can't you do the same thing with me? I'm protesting, I'm not going to FaceTime her,\" she joked.\n\nShe opened up to the panel about alllll the advice you get when you're about to become a mom, and she said it can be seriously overwhelming, especially when you're about to give birth.\n\n\"You get so much unsolicited advice that it drives you crazy, and you get really stressed out, but you're pregnant, you're nine months, and you're like, 'What is this? You're freaking me out. I'm already in this. I don't know what to do. There's no turning back.' And people just say the craziest things to you.\"\n\nShe said Kim is her go-to for advice, because she's not judgmental. She'll give the advice and then doesn't care if you use it or not. Kourtney, on the other hand, gives \"side-eye\" type mom advice, like when she told Khlo\u00e9 she shouldn't have a TV in her nursery. She wishes Kourtney would do the same thing as Kim.\n\n\"Educate me why I shouldn't have that, so I can decide [for myself],\" she said.\n\nFollow Emma on Instagram.", "images":
