Kanye is receiving help for depression and learning how to cope with stress better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey might be thinking about couples therapy, but so far it seems they haven\u2019t had any sessions together,\u201d the source adds.\n\nThe Wests\u2019 marriage has been the topic of conversation since 36-year-old Kim\u2019s October robbery and Kanye\u2019s recent hospitalization for exhaustion, but a source close to the couple revealed to PEOPLE last week that \u201csplitting is not even a point of discussion.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruly no truth behind divorce rumors. It\u2019s not something she would divorce him over,\u201d the source said, adding, \u201cHe had a breakdown, but it does not pertain to them not getting along.\u201d\n\nKim and Kanye have rarely been photographed together since October, though they did step out for a casual dinner for two at the Santa Monica restaurant Giorgio Baldi this past Sunday.\n\nThe couple shared pasta, according to the onlooker at the restaurant, and while they \u201cweren\u2019t affectionate,\u201d the duo \u201cwere very friendly\u201d and \u201chad good energy.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/blac-chyna2.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1333px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/kim-kardashian7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C660px%2C450px&resize=660%2C495&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/cameron-dallas.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1500px%2C1004px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/alan-thicke-4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/jim-carey-800.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C800px%2C535px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/new-years3.jpg?crop=0px%2C497px%2C1500px%2C1003px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/thicke-tanya.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/rob-k-wp.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1333px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/taylor-swift-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1700px%2C1137px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/kim-kardashian7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C660px%2C450px&resize=660%2C495&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brittany King"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018/http://people.com/celebrity/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-getting-counseling/", "title": "Kim Kardashian, Kanye West Aren't in Couples Therapy: Source", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1143086910", "description": "\"They are still both receiving individual therapy,\" a source tells PEOPLE of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West", "keywords": "Kim Kardashian West, Kanye West, Kim Kanye, Kanye West breakdown, Kim Kardashian Robbery, Kanye West tour,", "news_keywords": "Kim Kardashian West, Kanye West, Kim Kanye, Kanye West breakdown, Kim Kardashian Robbery, Kanye West tour,", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Are in Counseling After a Trying Year, Says Source", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018/http://people.com/celebrity/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-getting-counseling/", "description": "?They are still both receiving individual therapy,? a source tells PEOPLE of\u00a0Kim Kardashian and Kanye West", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161222040018im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/kim-kardashian7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C660px%2C450px&resize=660%2C495&ssl=1", "width": 660, "height": 495}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-12-21T19:29:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-12-21T19:12:36+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@people", "creator": "@people"}, "application-name": "PEOPLE.com", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://people.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/a39c9d87d3ee529a684f7a5b3b557adc?s=16"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1482348590.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
