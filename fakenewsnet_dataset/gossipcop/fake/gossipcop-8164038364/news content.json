But celebrity gossip website Radar Online reports that the host of the popular \u201cEllen\u201d show is a \u201cmean\u201d host of an exclusive celebrity card game and often \u201closes her temper.\u201d\n\nThe accusations against DeGeneres, known as one of the friendliest and most generous celebrities, are unsubstantiated. Gossip Cop, another celebrity gossip website, claims the report is false, and the accuser provides questionable evidence.\n\n\u2018Terrified\u2019 of Ellen\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever watched Ellen\u2019s daytime television show, you probably notice the host has a fun and bubbly personality. But, Radar Online suggests she\u2019s a different person behind closed doors.\n\nAccording to Radar, DeGeneres is running her own \u201cMolly\u2019s Game,\u201d a book and movie based on the illegal Hollywood card games hosted by former skier Molly Bloom.\n\nUnlike Bloom who used her charm to keep her players happy, Radar Online\u2019s source claims Ellen \u201closes her temper\u201d and \u201cpeople are terrified\u201d when something goes wrong during the celebrity high-stakes cash games she hosts.\n\nThe report claims the daytime talk show host only invites entertainment industry executives, show staffers, and her A-list celebrity pals, such as Chelsea Handler, Amy Schumer, and Melissa Etheridge.\n\n\u201cEllen is extremely selective about who she invites to the table,\u201d the source told Radar. \u201cBut once you\u2019re in, you\u2019d better be ready to handle her massive mood swings.\u201d\n\nRadar\u2019s \u201cstaff\u201d reporter (no one wanted to put their name behind this story) said DeGeneres \u201cthrew a tantrum\u201d during a recent game after the players were \u201cunable to keep up with the high-stakes pots,\u201d whatever that means.\n\nTabloid Pablum\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who Radar used as a source for the report. It could be another celebrity. Or, perhaps, it was a guy who heard from a guy who heard from a guy.\n\nBut the accusations have been disputed by Gossip Cop, which claims to have checked with a \u201csource close to the situation\u201d who dismissed the tabloid report as \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\nGossip Cop, however, wrote that Ellen does occasionally invite friends over to play poker. But the entertainment website adamantly denies she\u2019s some evil, mean-spirited host who throws temper tantrums.\n\nRadar Online is owned by American Media, Inc., the same company that owns the National Enquirer, one of the longest standing tabloid newspapers known for making bogus claims about celebrities and politicians.\n\nIf Ellen truly is hosting high-stakes games at her home, it wouldn\u2019t make sense for her to verbally abuse players. Molly Bloom charmed her guests because she wanted them to keep coming back or the game would eventually die.\n\nBut, apparently, Radar\u2019s crack staff of investigative journalists are convinced treating guests like garbage is good for business.", "images": ["http://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ecogra-light.svg", "https://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cardschat-logo-tagline.svg", "http://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/norton_secure.svg", "https://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GoG_730x344.jpg", "http://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/trustpilot-white.svg", "http://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gli-light.svg", "http://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cardschat-logo.svg", "http://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/itechlabs-light.svg", "http://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/trustarc-light.svg", "http://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ssl-light.svg", "https://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pokerstars-the-big-game-on-tour.jpg", "https://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/plugins/user-navigation/icons/person.svg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2f7f58c68f120ffb41a625ceae9727d1?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/plugins/itm-back-to-top-btn/build/icons/itm-back-to-top-icon.svg", "https://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ellen_h.jpg", "http://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/verisign-light.svg", "https://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Champion-Jason-Koon-_2023-Triton-London-SHRS_EV06-60K-NLH-7-Handed_Day-2_Giron_JG58952-800x534.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.cardschat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ellen_h.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jon Sofen", "Jon Began Playing Poker After Chris Moneymaker S Wsop Victory In Since Then", "He S Become A Prolific Writer About The Game", "Offering Daily News Coverage For Cardschat.
