It is also partly due to Meghan Markle adopting Prince Harry\u2019s fun personality. Ms James said: \u201cKate is always very much the pitch-perfect princess in terms of her regal-but-warm-looking body language and the levels of confidence she displays at royal events. \u201cHer Achilles heel was always Harry who often looked duty-bound to make her laugh or giggle and it seems from the body language here that Meghan might be adopting a similar role to try and forge a familiar and very congruent friendship with her sister-in-law.\n\n\u201cWhile Kate sits smiling as she watches the tennis, Meghan face-checks her closely in what looks a little like admiration bordering on hero-worship.\u201d The expert claimed the trait would suggest she's keen to take her lead from Kate. She added: \u201cMeghan's raised brows, wide eyes and her clapping hand gesture shows a genuine excitement for the event and the company and when she turns her very contagious grin on Kate you can see a possible hint of some growing behind-the-scenes fun between the two women.\u201d Ms James also said the women are truly friends and not just for the camera.\n\nJudi also says the women are truly friends and not just for the camera\n\nAlthough both women are 36, Ms Markle acts a lot younger, according to the body language expert. Speaking to The Sun, she continued: \u201cThe smiles entail rounded cheeks and eye-crinkling that lets us know they are authentic. \"It's what each woman does with their smiles that defines them as two rather different personalities. \"While Kate keeps her eye contact down or to the side, Meghan's eyes to the crowds and her dipped head and rather shy, lowered smile forms what is known as \u2018The Cute Effect\u2019, a trait of using pseudo infantile body language to lower your own status and form instant bonds of likeability.\n\nWimbledon: Meghan and Kate greet ball boys and girls\n\nBecome an Express Premium member Support fearless journalism\n\nSupport fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online, advert free\n\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-day\n\nFREE trial\n\nAlthough both women are 36, Ms Markle acts a lot young, according to Ms James\n\n\"So although these two women are the same age Kate's signals make her look more grown up than the very excited-looking Meghan.\" Kate, who is currently on maternity leave, is the more experienced royal of the two, having married Prince William back in 2011. She waved to crowds as she entered alongside Kate, who wore a white dress.", "images": ["https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/183x122/1839287_1.jpg",
