It is 100% false and totally made up,\u201d he tweeted Saturday, the same day the video was posted.\n\nGriffin, 56, spoke directly into the camera as she made multiple claims against Cohen.\n\n\u201cBoth times I did the show, right before we went live, Andy Cohen privately asked me in an office if I wanted to do blow,\u201d she alleged. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a drink in my life. You guys know I\u2019m no prude but I\u2019m kind of like a straightedge, I thought he was kidding the first time.\u201d\n\nAndy Cohen (left) and Kathy Griffin. Charles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty\n\nThe actress continued, \u201cI was hoping he was kidding, the second time I do the show, same thing. So once again we\u2019re alone in an office and he\u2019s like, \u2018Wanna do some coke?\u2019 And I\u2019m thinking, \u2018He\u2019s serious!\u2019 Trust me, he\u2019s going to say he\u2019s kidding and everything, no. He was asking me to do cocaine with him, that made me very uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nGriffin added that Cohen was a \u201cmiserable boss\u201d while her show, My Life on the D-List, aired on Bravo for six seasons.\n\n\u201cThe whole time I was working there, I didn\u2019t know how Andy Cohen wanted to be me \u2026 I didn\u2019t know Andy Cohen was on the red carpet, trying to be funny and asking questions on BravoTV.com,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know when they ended The D List and I desperately wanted to do a talk show, Andy Cohen would be the first television executive in the history of television to give himself a talk show \u2014 which seems to get picked up every season.\u201d\n\nThe video comes after Cohen pretended he didn\u2019t know the comedian. Asked about replacing Griffin on CNN\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve Live, Cohen smiled and told TMZ, \u201cWho? I don\u2019t know her.\u201d\n\nThe jab is a reference to Mariah Carey\u2018s infamous remark about not knowing Jennifer Lopez \u2014 \u201capparently I\u2019m forgetful,\u201d she quipped to Cohen on Watch What Happens Live in 2016.\n\nGriffin retaliated on Twitter, pointing out that the stars have known each other for years.\n\n\u201cEven when it\u2019s on tape, there are doubters? He is NOT kidding w paps. Was my boss for 10 years. Treated me like a dog. Deeply misogynistic,\u201d she wrote.\n\nCohen, 49, announced he\u2019s joining longtime friend Anderson Cooper on the broadcast earlier this month. Griffin co-hosted with the venerated journalist for 10 years, but CNN cut ties with the comedian in May after she posed for a photowith a mask of President Donald Trump\u2018s bloodied head in her hand.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kathy Griffin Apologizes for Donald Trump Beheading Photo: \u201cI Went Way Too Far\u201d\n\nIn her video, Griffin also took aim at TMZ founder Harvey Levin, accusing him of being complicit in quieting scandals surrounding Harvey Weinstein. She also gave out Levin\u2019s phone number, claiming he reported every canceled show following her Trump photo while she and her family received death threats.\n\n\u201cPeople like Harvey Levin and Andy Cohen honestly just live to take women down,\u201d she said.", "images":
