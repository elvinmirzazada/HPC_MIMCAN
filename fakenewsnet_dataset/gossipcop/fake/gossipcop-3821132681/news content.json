Swift \u2014 who wore a long black dress and shades for the occasion \u2014 wrote, \u201cFact: I\u2019ve never been more excited about a tour than I am about this one. And it starts TOMORROW. Also, not even remotely tour related, but today I met a cactus.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, Alwyn, 27, posted a picture of the same cactus on the same day, captioning his snapshot with only the corresponding emoji. In his picture, he also stood solo, wearing a grey shirt, black shorts, a cap, and sandals.\n\nSwift kicked off her Reputation tour in Glendale, Arizona, the next day. During the show, the singer seemingly pointed at Alwyn, who was seen in the crowd, as she belted out \u201cGorgeous.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Taylor Swift\u2019s Friends Think Joe Alwyn Could Be \u201cThe One\u201d\n\nAlwyn has since posted a picture from the set of his upcoming film The Favourite with Nicholas Hoult, Emma Stone, and others. Swift liked the photo.\n\nSwift and Alwyn, who dated for months before news of their relationship broke in May 2017, have been spotted spending quality time together as of late.\n\nIn July, the couple jetted off to Turks and Caicos, where they splashed and snorkeled in the ocean and held hands on the beach. A source told PEOPLE at the time of their trip, \u201cThey were lovey-dovey.\u201d\n\nAnd in May, Swift and Alwyn stopped by The Flask, a pub in London.\n\n\u201cShe seems to be in a great place both career and love wise,\u201d an insider told PEOPLE in June. Added the source, \u201cJoe is just an amazing boyfriend. He is very supportive. Taylor adores his family. She\u2019s in a very good place.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/nd_1DrSr37bz1KkUwGt6HvbFqn0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(745x374:747x376)/Matty-Healy-02-053023-bdb91fff9e1142408b55941d2c0b6203.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/POi6V7nJ41AUZyhbMazbOTGrgLw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/alwyn-swift-1-dd9b8464f8b742d6b1a74c7a255f5aea.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/FlCG0QCc-zuuDf9klssRobxBc84=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(659x239:661x241)/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-03a56e38c14f4539a70038d5f083b65e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/nyAfdsr_QlPjR45c4FeGD71dUEM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(731x404:733x406)/emma-stone-taylor-swift-060623-1-ca9d999721ce47dda3e1182c4ea2ddae.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/vS0aH53w3mId1_IpNBPrx4BR19Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/joealwyntayorswift11252019-33-adf1cf8383294b8784150e21bb8dd957.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-uso9rIB5qWENFYW1boWS2-MFT4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(695x0:697x2)/joe-alwyn-1ec2279afc2b4fa190f601fcc74b5fd8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/_7z6XJ0Zn5ZBvtbAN-YjrE16zsc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(475x237:477x239)/taylor-swift-eras-tour-041423-2-57e3928621c24ff190ecf7169daea8cb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Sv6ZGYQuofwgNVUYZt_eW-He_Dc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/taylor-swift-matty-healy-052523-1-146ae998b03e4116be4df7aa17842bb1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/kbXSF6wbbkX0uTm6LEeM6TeeK2U=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1561x640:1563x642)/Matty-Healy-052823-9be9e6495d3346ddb8db4688d4ae4174.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0bvp6_IaRYiGB_t61-IiOb71QdE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/taylor-swift-2023041086-1d368cd6468143eea30a4f9af72e0a5a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/v5Alz2HGn1jBwRm3ckn1g2C5OWY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/taylor-swift-060123-1-5e885391434b4c70b6fe782a08e44d31.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4RzlWIR2-WRBPIb_z5xusI5bsgA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(511x0:513x2)/taylor-swift-0420-18d73f18ccbd40cd9ffa3d032f11db25.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jEw4qBrrcv-xOfhdZSyJdTbh3PY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2167x0:2169x2)/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-breakup-embed-1ed5eb95000049fc88166c7c58516373.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jSQx3Pc120RP4KKj-bncYkbxPKA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-041023-1-99252e753a294780ae8ffdc8660b310c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/s4-RWkMGhk37quaOitNYoeYCSEA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(723x350:725x352)/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-052823-02-948540113f9a477a8fd522d09e267765.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/OYM86dxmhkict83ROgYh07N2Fb8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(725x106:727x108)/Ashanti-and-Nelly-attend-3rd-Annual-Birthday-Ball-for-Quality-Control-060923-1-dfc953d2e3db46908fffdaf490afbdc5.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/-uso9rIB5qWENFYW1boWS2-MFT4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(695x0:697x2)/joe-alwyn-1ec2279afc2b4fa190f601fcc74b5fd8.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Zauzmer", "Emily Zauzmer Is A Former Digital Writer At People.
