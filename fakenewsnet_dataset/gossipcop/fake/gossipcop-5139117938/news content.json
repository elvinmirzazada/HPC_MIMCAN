You can\u2019t recreate that,\u201d he said.\n\nCowell said he was asked but kindly replied, \"No.\" He might have other obligations anyway, including judging duties on \"America's Got Talent.\"\n\nWhen the announcement of the show's return made news on Tuesday, Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment, said in a statement, \"'American Idol' is a pop culture staple that left the air too soon ... We are thrilled viewers will once again share in these inspiring stories of people realizing their dreams.\"\n\nThat news came one day after longtime \u201cIdol\u201d host Ryan Seacrest joined \u201cLive With Kelly and Ryan.\" He'll be moving to New York during the week to film the morning show. No word on if he'll be coming back for \"Idol.\"\n\nHe did speak about a possible comeback in one of his first days on \"Live.\"\n\nABC News' Katie Kindelan contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/washington-tree-down-main-abc-jt-231128_1701211919476_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-american-idol-ml-170512_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/jimmy-carter-4-rt-bb-232811_1701198112004_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/pence-trump3-file-gty-ml-231127_1701110318739_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/wirestory_4d3323728cf2d5f8da36ae0d2fd3994a_1x1_144.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/images/hulu.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/rockefeller-tree-ap-jef-231128_1701183464711_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-american-idol-ml-170512_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/simon-cowell-returning-american-idol/story?id=47370226", "title": "Simon Cowell will not be returning to 'American Idol'", "meta_data": {"description": "\"American Idol\" fans were delighted to hear earlier this week that the reality singing show will be returning to ABC for the 2017-2018 season.", "keywords": "american idol, simon cowell, Article, 47370226", "copyright": "2023 ABC News", "author": "ABC News", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Simon Cowell will not be returning to 'American Idol'", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/simon-cowell-returning-american-idol/story?id=47370226", "title": "Simon Cowell will not be returning to 'American Idol'", "description": "\"American Idol\" fans were delighted to hear earlier this week that the reality singing show will be returning to ABC for the 2017-2018 season.", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-american-idol-ml-170512_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2017-05-12T15:07:14Z", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,47370226", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,47370226", "googleplay": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/simon-cowell-returning-american-idol/story?id=47370226"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "ABC News", "title": "Simon Cowell will not be returning to 'American Idol'", "description": "\"American Idol\" fans were delighted to hear earlier this week that the reality singing show will be returning to ABC for the 2017-2018 season.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/simon-cowell-returning-american-idol/story?id=47370226", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-american-idol-ml-170512_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,47370226", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,47370226", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for ipad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/simon-cowell-returning-american-idol/story?id=47370226", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/simon-cowell-returning-american-idol/story?id=47370226"}}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
