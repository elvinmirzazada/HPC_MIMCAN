It's unclear who Curry was referencing.\n\nLack further said \"any actions that run counter to our core values are met with consequences, no matter who the offender,\" and he added that the company was \"deeply saddened\" by the news.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times, Ari Wilkenfeld, acivl rights lawyer who said he represented the woman who made the complaint to NBC said:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy client and I met with representatives from NBC\u2019s Human Resources and Legal Departments at 6 p.m. on Monday for an interview that lasted several hours. Our impression at this point is that NBC acted quickly, as all companies should, when confronted with credible allegations of sexual misconduct in the workplace. While I am encouraged by NBC\u2019s response to date, I am in awe of the courage my client showed to be the first to raise a complaint and to do so without making any demands other than the company do the right thing.\u201d\n\nSavannah Guthrie, Lauer's colleague on NBC's \"Today\" show, made the announcement Wednesday and read Lack's statement on-air.\n\n\"We are devastated,\" she said.\n\nLauer had been a fixture on NBC since the early 1990s, traveling the world to report on a variety of subjects. He hosted \"Today\" for two decades.\n\nLauer reported live from the Winter Olympics in 2014 and interviewed both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump reacted Wednesday morning in a tweet: \"Wow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for 'inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.' But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack's past!\"\n\nNBC's dismissal of Lauer marks the latest in a string of entertainment and media personalities being ousted in response to accusations of inappropriate behavior.\n\nMark Halperin and Charlie Rose were recently fired from television roles after being accused of sexual misconduct at work.\n\nLauer is married to Annette Roque Lauer, a Dutchwoman and former model. He has three kids.\n\nWatch the full statement below:", "images": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/rebrand/newsletter-bull.png", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/privacy-options.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=politics", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png", "https://i.insider.com/57d16ce309d293d50f8b689e?width=700", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f0b17f914c359018b6cdc?width=1280&height=866&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/bottom-right.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/newsletters/insider-today-logo.png", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/top-left.svg", "https://i.insider.com/57d16ce309d293d50f8b689e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/57d16ce309d293d50f8b689e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Lockie"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/matt-lauer-reportedly-fired-for-inappropriate-workplace-behavior-2017-11", "title": "NBC host Matt Lauer fired for 'inappropriate sexual behavior' at work", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "NBC host Matt Lauer fired for 'inappropriate sexual behavior' at work", "datePublished": "2017-11-29T12:19:00Z", "dateModified": "2017-11-29T20:15:47Z", "news_keywords": "Politics, News, Advertising, Media, NBC, News, Politics", "description": "The NBC host and prominent TV journalist Matt Lauer has been fired after an accusation of \"inappropriate sexual behavior,\" the network said Wednesday.", "author": "Alex Lockie", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "Politics", "og": {"title": "NBC host Matt Lauer fired for 'inappropriate sexual behavior' at work", "description": "The NBC host and prominent TV journalist Matt Lauer has been fired after an accusation of \"inappropriate sexual behavior,\" the network said Wednesday.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/matt-lauer-reportedly-fired-for-inappropriate-workplace-behavior-2017-11", "image": "https://i.insider.com/57d16ce309d293d50f8b689e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "NBC host Matt Lauer fired for 'inappropriate sexual behavior' at work", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-29", "sailthru.tags": "Matt Lauer, NBC, News, Politics, Alex Lockie", "sailthru.description": "The NBC host and prominent TV journalist Matt Lauer has been fired after an accusation of \"inappropriate sexual behavior,\" the network said Wednesday.", "sailthru.author": "Alex Lockie", "sailthru.verticals": "politics, news, advertising, media", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/57d16cd209d29325008b697c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/57d16cd209d29325008b697c?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@PoliticsInsider"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"pb_2": "holdout", "smart-banner": "control", "ir-als": "v2"}, "ii-split-test": {"bii-media-show-lock": "variant", "ii-finance-email-lock": "variant", "ii-retail-show-lock": "control", "iab-fb-throttle": "control"}, "viking-id": "5a1ea1db3dbef4ae448b88ad", "env": "prod", "parsely-tags": "Matt Lauer,NBC,News,Politics", "parsely-section": "politics", "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2023-11", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511906400.0, "source": "http://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
