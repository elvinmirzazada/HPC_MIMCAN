This is a historic moment. I\u2019d like to be a part of history,\u201d he told the website.\n\nThomas Markle told the celebrity news site TMZ on Tuesday that he wanted to walk his daughter down the aisle, but was not sure if he could.\n\nWhether Meghan Markle\u2019s father shows at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday was the subject of fevered speculation among royal obsessives on Tuesday.\n\nHe said he was back in the hospital after suffering chest pains and wasn\u2019t sure if the doctors would release him in time.\n\nHe also told TMZ website that Meghan tried calling him on Monday, but he missed the call. She then texted him saying she loved him and was concerned about his health, the website said.\n\nHis latest chat with TMZ comes after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle asked for \u201cunderstanding\u201d amid claims that her father would not attend the royal wedding.\n\nKensington Palace, the official residence of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, issued a statement late on Monday following reports that Thomas Markle, who lives quietly in Mexico, had pulled out of the wedding. The statement did not confirm or deny speculation surrounding his attendance.\n\n\u201cThis is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMeghan Markle, right, attending the closing ceremonies of the Invictus Games with her mother, Doria Ragland, in Toronto last September.

The website also claimed that he had recently suffered a minor heart attack.\n\nTMZ said that he had regretted posing for pictures, which included photographs of him getting measured for his wedding suit and another of him looking at pictures of his daughter and future son-in-law. Thomas Markle told the website he looked \u201cstupid and hammy.\u201d\n\nThe 73-year-old retired Hollywood lighting director told TMZ he was \u201cpopping Valium\u201d because of chest pains brought on by \u201cemotional upset\u201d. Markle worried he might return to the hospital soon.\n\nThe reports of a possible no-show by Markle\u2019s father were splashed across the front pages of several British newspapers on Tuesday.\n\nMarkle\u2019s half-sister, Samantha Markle, said that she was the one to blame for the snaps and that they were intended to portray her father in a positive light.\n\n\u201cThe bad press over my father doing staged photos is my fault,\u201d she said, according to tweets seen by the BBC.\n\n\u201cThe media was unfairly making him look bad so I suggested he do positive photos for his benefit and the benefit of the royal family. We had no idea he would be taken advantage of. It was not for money.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Samantha Markle tangled with host Piers Morgan on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain show.\n\n\u201cYou say that this is all the media\u2019s fault that he\u2019s not coming to the wedding because of this,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cMany of our viewers may have watched your activities in a year and a half and noticed you have been treating your sister in a shabby way.\u201d\n\nBritish police patrol Windsor Castle in Windsor, England, on Tuesday, ahead of the wedding on Saturday of Britain\u2019s Prince Harry to the American actress Meghan Markle. Photo: EPA-EFE\n\nSamantha Markle defended her father\u2019s granting permission to be photographed. \u201cThe goal of those photographs was basically because he\u2019s feeling defenceless,\u201d she said. \u201cA person has the right to say enough is enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah but here\u2019s the problem. The media have been bombarded with letters from Kensington Palace and Thomas Markle as well,\u201d claiming the press should not intrude on his privacy, Morgan said.\n\n\u201cNow it turns out he was actively invading his own privacy for a check from a photographer,\u201d he said.\n\nThen the TV host lashed into Samantha Markle for cashing in as well by publishing her book, The Diary of Princess Pushy\u2019s Sister.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no bigger media vulture than you,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been trashing her for two years, you little vulture.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/05/16/dc41876e-5877-11e8-a7d9-186ba932a081_1320x770_072211.jpg", "https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/05/16/351efae0-587a-11e8-a7d9-186ba932a081_1320x770_072211.jpg", "https://img.i-scmp.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=contain,width=60,format=auto/sites/default/files/styles/118x118/public/the-washington-post-250.jpg?itok=qoGv5M98", "https://assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif", "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_scmp_120/public/images/methode/2018/05/16/cd090ede-5877-11e8-a7d9-186ba932a081_image_hires_072211.jpg?itok=KO42A2vE&v=1526426537", "https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/05/16/dbd2a390-587b-11e8-a7d9-186ba932a081_600x_072211.JPG", "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/768x768/public/images/methode/2018/05/16/cd090ede-5877-11e8-a7d9-186ba932a081_1280x720_072211.jpg?itok=jg7OywN4"], "top_img": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_scmp_120/public/images/methode/2018/05/16/cd090ede-5877-11e8-a7d9-186ba932a081_image_hires_072211.jpg?itok=KO42A2vE&v=1526426537", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Washington Post"], "canonical_link": "https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2146295/meghan-markles-father-says-he-wants-walk-his-daughter-down-aisle", "title": "Meghan Markle\u2019s father now says he will walk his daughter down the aisle \u2013 if he can make it to the UK", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Thomas Markle says, \u2018I\u2019d like to be a part of history\u2019, but is not sure if he will be able to travel to Britain and attend the royal wedding because of his health", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SCMPNews"}, "fb": {"app_id": 282931841805811}, "og": {"title": "Meghan Markle\u2019s dad now says he\u2019ll walk her down aisle \u2013 if he can get to UK", "description": "Thomas Markle says, \u2018I\u2019d like to be a part of history\u2019, but is not sure if he will be able to travel to Britain and attend the royal wedding because of his health", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/2146295/meghan-markles-father-says-he-wants-walk-his-daughter-down-aisle", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_scmp_120/public/images/methode/2018/05/16/cd090ede-5877-11e8-a7d9-186ba932a081_image_hires_072211.jpg?itok=KO42A2vE&v=1526426537", "site_name": "South China Morning Post"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_store_id": 623201967, "app_name": "SCMP", "url": "scmp://news/world/europe/article/2146295/meghan-markles-father-says-he-wants-walk-his-daughter-down-aisle?entity=node&type=article&id=2146295"}, "android": {"package": "com.scmp.newspulse", "app_name": "SCMP", "url": "scmp://news/world/europe/article/2146295/meghan-markles-father-says-he-wants-walk-his-daughter-down-aisle?entity=node&type=article&id=2146295"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=623201967", "keywords": "Royal wedding, Meghan Markle, Thomas Markle", "news_keywords": "Royal wedding, Meghan Markle, Thomas Markle", "article": {"section": "Culture", "tag": "Celebrity children", "published_time": "2018-05-16T04:11:17+08:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-16T07:22:15+08:00"}, "pocket-site-verification": "25fd909c3fd10ded451415fc076ba8", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1", "cXenseParse": {"articleid": 2146295, "author": "The Washington Post", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/768x768/public/images/methode/2018/05/16/cd090ede-5877-11e8-a7d9-186ba932a081_image_hires_072211.jpg?itok=i5G4hjoe&v=1526426537"}, "next-head-count": 48}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526415077.0, "source": "http://www.scmp.com", "summary": ""}
