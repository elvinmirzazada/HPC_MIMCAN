What is clear is that Rihanna is a super fan of the tournament \u2014 she was even cheering from the stands when Germany bested Argentina 1-0 to win the 2014 World Cup.\n\nThe \u201cWild Thoughts\u201d hitmaker remained coy while talking about her current relationship in Vogue\u2018s June cover story.\n\n\u201cI used to feel guilty about taking personal time, but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before,\u201d she explained.\n\nBack in June 2017, the Ocean\u2019s 8 star and Jameel were spotted kissing and grabbing coffee together. Since then, the two have been photographed together a few times \u2014 including in October, when a source told PEOPLE they were \u201ccanoodling all night\u201d while grabbing dinner and bowling with a group of friends in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Rihanna Wears Pope Hat, Robe and Intricately Bejeweled Dress to Catholic-Themed 2018 Met Gala\n\nIn December, Rihanna also sparked rumors of an engagement when she rocked a sizable diamond on that finger to Chris Rock\u2019s show at Madison Square Garden in New York City. However, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that the Doyle & Doyle antique brown diamond cluster ring is not linked to an engagement.\n\nGetty; Abdul Latif Jameel\n\nJameel is an heir to the Abdul Latif Jameel business dynasty of Saudi Arabia. The company owns the right to sell Toyota Motor vehicles in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries (among other ventures) and Hassan serves as the president of the charitable organization within the company, Community Jameel.", "images":
