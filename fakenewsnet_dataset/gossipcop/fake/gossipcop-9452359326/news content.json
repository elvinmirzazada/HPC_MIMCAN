Angie has told some friends she isn't ready to date, but she has been seeing a handsome, older-looking man who is a real estate agent,\" the source claims. \"He isn't a celebrity or high profile in any way.\"\n\n\"Angie was in a very bad place after [her] split [from Brad],\" the source adds. \"Just having another adult to spend time with has been helpful.\"\n\nThe source says that Pitt has also moved on, and any possibility of him getting back together with Jolie is highly unlikely.\n\n\"People talk about them reuniting, but it will never happen,\" the source tells us. \"Things between Brad and Angie really ended poorly, and while they've attempted therapy with the [six] children [they share], they can barely be in the same room together.\"\n\nET has reached out to Jolie's rep for comment.\n\nDespite the highly publicized breakup, Jolie appears to be enjoying her day-to-day life. In addition to her job as an actress, filmmaker and humanitarian, the brunette beauty has been spending a lot of quality time with Shiloh, Maddox, Vivienne, Zahara, Pax and Knox, the six kids she shares with Pitt.\n\nEarlier this month, she took a few of them to go see the new Tomb Raider reboot, which stars Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft, the iconic role she originally played in 2001's Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, and again in 2003 for the sequel, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life. She's also been spotted out and about, doing normal, everyday activities, like grocery shopping.\n\nWhile Jolie has seemingly started to become comfortable on her own, Pitt (who's notoriously private), has become a changed man, going out more and enjoying time with close friends, an additional source told ET on Monday.\n\n\"He has made changes in his life since the split,\" the source said. \"When they first split, he spent a lot of time at home and was often very down about what was going on. He was a homebody for many months, but in the last month or two, he\u2019s been going out more. He enjoys going out to eat with close friends.\"\n\n\"He's very private about who he\u2019s seeing, but he does continue to casually date,\" the source added. \"The women he sees are not in the public eye.\"\n\nHear more in the video below.\n\nReporting by Adriane Schwartz.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-11/eto_news_daily_pete_ariana_110118.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fbrad_pitt_902019780.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-03%2Fjolie_920231356.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/jolie_920231356.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2Fangelina_jolie_shiloh_zahara_gettyimages-913996924.jpg%3Fh%3Dc9cc6ce1&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/jolie_920231356.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/inside-angelina-jolies-post-split-life-without-brad-pitt-exclusive-99099", "title": "Inside Angelina Jolie's Post-Split Life Without Brad Pitt (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/jolie_920231356.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "ET breaks down all the ways the actress has been moving on since calling it quits from her estranged husband in September 2016.", "title": "Inside Angelina Jolie's Post-Split Life Without Brad Pitt (Exclusive)", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/inside-angelina-jolies-post-split-life-without-brad-pitt-exclusive-99099", "type": "Article"}, "description": "ET breaks down all the ways the actress has been moving on since calling it quits from her estranged husband in September 2016.", "twitter": {"description": "ET breaks down all the ways the actress has been moving on since calling it quits from her estranged husband in September 2016.", "title": "Inside Angelina Jolie's Post-Split Life Without Brad Pitt (Exclusive)", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/inside-angelina-jolies-post-split-life-without-brad-pitt-exclusive-99099", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/jolie_920231356.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Inside Angelina Jolie's Post-Split Life Without Brad Pitt (Exclusive) | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, News, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
