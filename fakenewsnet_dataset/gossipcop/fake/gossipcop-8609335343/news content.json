Photo: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images\n\nThe first rule of going solo: Distance yourself as far as possible from the group and fan base that jump-started your career. Or so goes the advice Liam Payne is apparently following from Zayn: He\u2019s the last to venture out on his own and the first to come out burning a bridge he still has to cross when it\u2019s all said and done. On Liam\u2019s first single, \u201cStrip That Down,\u201d he\u2019s dissed One Direction plain as day. \u201cYou know I used to be in 1D, now I\u2019m out free,\u201d he sings. \u201cPeople want me for one thing, that\u2019s not me. I\u2019m not changing the way that I used to be, I just want to have fun and get rowdy.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut with nearly all remaining members of One Direction releasing new music of their own within weeks of each other, this song is not the only opportunity Payne has had to make his thoughts on his bandmates known. Speaking with Music Choice, he complimented Niall Horan\u2019s new singles, but Harry Styles, not so much. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s not my sort of music. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d listen to,\u201d he said. But he did have a quick save: \u201cI think he did a great job of doing what he wanted to do. That\u2019s the way I\u2019d put it best, I think.\u201d Liam also noted that Harry would probably say the same about his music since Harry doesn\u2019t listen to hip-hop. \u201cMy song\u2019s more \u2018Rack City\u2019 and his song is more of a different era to something I\u2019d listen to, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cStrip That Down\u201d does feature a rapper, Migos\u2019s Quavo, but a redux of the only song of note that Tyga has ever made it is not.\n\n", "images": ["https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/7a4/a30/75f8858697b92dcf7d2fa4305d2ab756ff-succession-with-eyes-open.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.png", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b3d/336/bc7bcc6907915cf93226c8212d877b2c3e-cynthia-nixon.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e75/055/c0d568146f8824ed7a619cd514fca1aeb6-airbnb-alt-01.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/96c/4df/d6f03c9ccb2f0a0d51adcd1841c74c2dac-19-liam-payne.rsquare.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/96c/4df/d6f03c9ccb2f0a0d51adcd1841c74c2dac-19-liam-payne.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1ef/d78/c6483531413874e8eacdd0a203bf8a486e-dee-lockett.2x.rsquare.w168.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2e2/98e/99818d3d7a6a16d9c4b41dca7a9760ec10-2423Cov-4x5-CONFLICT.w240.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/96c/4df/d6f03c9ccb2f0a0d51adcd1841c74c2dac-19-liam-payne.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dee Lockett", "A Senior Editor On The Culture Pages At New York"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/05/liam-payne-strip-that-down-one-direction-diss.html", "title": "Liam Payne\u2019s Solo Career Has Started With a One Direction Diss", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "liam payne, one direction, diss tracks, where's the beef?, right click, music, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Liam Payne\u2019s Solo Career Has Started With a One Direction Diss", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/05/liam-payne-strip-that-down-one-direction-diss.html", "description": "\u201cYou know I used to be in 1D, now I\u2019m out free.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/96c/4df/d6f03c9ccb2f0a0d51adcd1841c74c2dac-19-liam-payne.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Hear Liam Payne Diss One Direction on His First Solo Song", "description": "\u201cYou know I used to be in 1D, now I\u2019m out free.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/96c/4df/d6f03c9ccb2f0a0d51adcd1841c74c2dac-19-liam-payne.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "description": "\u201cYou know I used to be in 1D, now I\u2019m out free.\u201d", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "article": {"tag": "liam payne, one direction, diss tracks, where's the beef?, right click, music", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "sailthru.tags": "liam payne, one direction, diss tracks, where's the beef?, right click, music", "author": "Dee Lockett", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "sectionOverride": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.vulture.com/media/sites/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
