Kim Kardashian welcomed her third child \u2014 a daughter named Chicago \u2014 on January 15. Then Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian became first-time moms (They have daughters Stormi, 5 months, and True, 3 months, respectively.)\n\nKris marvels at how Kylie has adjusted to parenthood. \u201cKylie is more calm than I was,\u201d she tells Us. \u201cI look at the way she she loves Stormi and takes care of her. She doesn\u2019t go anywhere without her.\u201d The businesswoman is equally in awe of Khloe \u2014 through she never doubted the Good American denim cofounder\u2019s mothering skills.\n\nRelated: True Thompson\u2019s Baby Album Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian has been a doting mommy ever since her first baby with Tristan Thompson, daughter True, arrived in April 2018.

True is the light of her life.\u201d\n\nJust before Khloe gave birth, videos and photos surfaced of her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, getting close with other women during her pregnancy.
