Lindsay Shookus, his current girlfriend, doesn\u2019t see their friendliness as a good thing as OK! has exclusively reported that she gave him an ultimatum about their relationship during a dramatic showdown in Hawaii recently.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAn insider claimed that Lindsay started to feel unsettled about their year-long relationship after she heard of a secret sleepover in early March between Ben and Jen at the California home they once shared with their children Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel. Lindsay, who has a 5-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, \u201cunderstands that Ben needs to be there for his children,\u201d says the source, \u201cbut she found it strange that he went to the marital home and spent the night.\u201d\n\nEven though she tried to brush off his overnight stay, she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that \u201cevery time things seem to be going well, something happens to remind her that Jen and the kids come first,\u201d according to the source. Lindsay decided to move past Ben\u2019s indiscretion by flying to Hawaii where he is filming the upcoming movie Triple Frontier. The two enjoyed some quality time together before Jen decided to show up with their children, which brought Lindsay right back to reality.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cJen and the kids stayed in a hotel, but when she showed up to Ben\u2019s rental, Lindsay was furious,\u201d the source claimed. \u201cShe ultimately blew up at Ben, telling him she\u2019s confused about his intentions and yelling, \u2018It\u2019s either her or me!\u2019\u201d It seemed his response was not so reassuring. The source said that although Ben is not reconciling with his wife, he did indicate how proud he is of how hard they work at their relationship, and that he\u2019ll always choose Jen\u2019s wishes for their family over everything else.\n\nThe source also claims that Ben is sober, healthy, and \u201cin a really good place\u201d minus the tension with Lindsay. For her part, the source adds, \u201cLindsay gets that there will be holidays and birthdays to share, but Ben and Jen\u2019s friendship is unnerving.\u201d Is Lindsay in the right here regarding Ben\u2019s relationship with his ex, or is she overreacting?
