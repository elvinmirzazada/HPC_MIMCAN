Georgina was one of the 22 people killed in Monday night's bombing at Manchester Arena at Ariana Grande's concert. But she was also a superfan of ABC's fantasy fairy tale series. She went to a convention to meet the likes of Emilie de Ravin (Belle), Rebecca Mader (Zelena), and Lana Parrilla (Regina), and was incredibly excited, documenting her amazing time in a Twitter thread spanning more than 70 posts. View full post on X\n\nIn one of the tweets, Georgina raved about getting the chance to speak with and have her picture taken with de Ravin, who plays Belle on the show.\n\nAnd it seems that meeting had left a huge impression on the actress, as she paid tribute to the superfan after learning that she had passed away.\n\n\"RIP Georgina, you beautiful soul,\" Emilie wrote on Instagram. \"Words can't express my anger and sadness towards the people involved in planning and carrying out the attack last night in #manchester .\n\n\"\ud83d\udc94 is an understatement. My love and courage goes out to Georgina's family and friends and to all the families and friends of the victims last night. Praying for eternal peace for Georgina and all involved.\"\n\nDe Ravin wasn't the only Once Upon a Time star to reminisce, either.\n\nMader and Parrilla also shared their tributes, as well as Sean Maguire (Robin Hood) and Karen David (Jasmine).\n\nColin O'Donoghue (Hook) tweeted as well:\n\nAn emergency number has been set up for those who are concerned about loved ones or anyone who may have been in the area \u2013 0800 096 0095.\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?
