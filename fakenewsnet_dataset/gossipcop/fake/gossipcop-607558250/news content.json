But some negativity ensued, too.\n\n\u201cThe divorce rumors came and then we really knew the perceptions had changed,\u201d the Arrested Development star, 45, told Us Weekly exclusively at the General Public x RH Celebration in West Hollywood on Wednesday, June 27. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding. I know it sounds ridiculous, but when that started happening I thought, \u2018Oh, now we\u2019re finally accepted.\u2019 We get the same s\u2013t as every celebrity couple.\u201d\n\nRelated: Gay Celebrities\u2019 Coming Out Stories Take a look back at LGBT celebrities' emotional, inspiring coming out stories from over the years -- including Wentworth Miller, Ellen Page, Jodie Foster and more\n\nSplit rumors aren\u2019t the only ones that de Rossi has faced. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, this is great that I\u2019m pregnant, not pregnant, divorced, not divorced, whatever,\u201d she added. \u201cThat means there is an acceptance for this.\u201d\n\nThe actress said she and DeGeneres, 60, don\u2019t necessarily laugh off the speculation. In fact, they try to ignore it completely.\n\n\u201cI was at a newsstand \u2026 and there was a cover of Brad [Pitt] and Jen [Aniston],\u201d she recalled. \u201cI literally just stared at it, and I was like, \u2018They haven\u2019t seen each other. \u2026 How is this even a thing? I know for a fact.\u2019 \u2026 I actually took a picture of it and sent it to Ellen and said, \u2018Can you believe this?\u2019 Anyway, no, in other words, we avoid it. We don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity LGBT Allies In honor of Gay Pride Month, see which stars support marriage equality\n\nDe Rossi also spoke with Us about launching The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund in honor of her wife\u2019s birthday in January. \u201cAll of it was a complete surprise, which was very difficult. It was so difficult to keep it from her,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s so observant. I literally had to take my email address off all of our shared devices at home \u2026 because I knew that if she saw an email coming in from Africa, it would be all over. She would put it all together.\u201d\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.

I wouldn\u2019t call myself an expert, I\u2019m just a fan,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw the disparity between the quality of art that you can get in the fine art market and decorative art that is available to most people. I just thought that it was kind of a shame that you have to be extremely interested in art \u2014 or interested enough to go to an art gallery or learn the art market \u2014 in order to get a better quality of art than what is available. I really wanted to bridge the gap a little and just introduce more artists into this kind of vortex in between and really support them because most of the art that you see that\u2019s available at retail is made by graphic designers or computer generated. I wanted actual artists to be able to share their work.\u201d", "images": ["http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/a360media-logo-color.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Portia-de-Rossi-and-Ellen-DeGeneres-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=1600%2C900&quality=86&strip=all", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AmazonIsh.png?crop=35px%2C0px%2C1281px%2C1281px&resize=300%2C300&quality=86&strip=all", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Prince-William-Feels-Exasperated-by-Cruel-Narratives-in-New-Book-Endgame-569.jpg?crop=0px%2C39px%2C1406px%2C795px&resize=600%2C338&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Portia-de-Rossi-and-Ellen-DeGeneres-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=40&strip=all", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Portia-de-Rossi-and-Ellen-DeGeneres-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/portia-de-rossi-ellen-divorce-rumors-make-us-feel-accepted/", "title": "Portia de Rossi: Ellen Divorce Rumors Make Us Feel \u2018Accepted\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "ahrefs-site-verification": "0c593552a61f5d2f07d12f3629456cc24366510fb83bd76eb9504919faac5af7", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Exclusive", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Portia de Rossi opened up to Us Weekly exclusively about the rumors that she and Ellen DeGeneres are headed for a divorce \u2014 find out what she said", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Portia de Rossi: Ellen Divorce Rumors Make Us Feel \u2018Accepted\u2019", "description": "Portia de Rossi opened up to Us Weekly exclusively about the rumors that she and Ellen DeGeneres are headed for a divorce \u2014 find out what she said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/portia-de-rossi-ellen-divorce-rumors-make-us-feel-accepted/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T22:10:56+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Portia-de-Rossi-and-Ellen-DeGeneres-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Portia-de-Rossi-and-Ellen-DeGeneres-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-06-28T16:26:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T22:10:56+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Portia de Rossi: Ellen Divorce Rumors Make Us Feel \u2018Accepted\u2019", "description": "Portia de Rossi opened up to Us Weekly exclusively about the rumors that she and Ellen DeGeneres are headed for a divorce \u2014 find out what she said", "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Portia-de-Rossi-and-Ellen-DeGeneres-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.3.2", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-28 12:26:07", "sailthru.title": "Portia de Rossi Opens Up About Her Love for Art and Wife Ellen DeGeneres", "sailthru.tags": ",Exclusive,Celebrity News,celebrity families,celebrity relationships,dating and relationships,Ellen DeGeneres,family,marriage,pop culture,Portia De Rossi,society", "sailthru.author": "Nicholas Hautman", "sailthru.description": "Portia de Rossi believes that people\u2019s perceptions of same-sex marriage changed for the better when she tied the knot with Ellen DeGeneres in 2008.
