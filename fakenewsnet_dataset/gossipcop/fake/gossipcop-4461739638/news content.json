Which is exactly why we are so shocked by what Tish Cyrus has to say about him. Miley Cyrus\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t get the pressure to marry Liam Hemsworth.\n\nSay what?!!\n\nWhile the rest of the world drools over Miley and Liam\u2019s beautiful relationship, Tish just doesn\u2019t see the big deal. Guess visiting children\u2019s hospitals together and raising a bunch of animals doesn\u2019t warm her heart like it does for us! Regardless of what the rest of the world wants, Tish thinks Miley has plenty of time before she even has to start thinking of marriage.\n\nShe even gave us their relationship update!\n\nBut don\u2019t get her wrong. Tish totally supports her daughter\u2019s relationship.\n\nTish Cyrus spoke with Mario Lopez on his radio show on Wednesday, and revealed that Miley and Liam are stronger than ever. But, wedding bells are not in their immediate future.\n\n\u201cShe is not eloping. She is not getting married. They are so freaking happy and living in Malibu,\u201d\n\nHonestly, what else would we want for the power couple that is giving us ultimate #RelationshipGoals?\n\nHappy valentines \ud83c\udf39 A post shared by Liam Hemsworth (@liamhemsworth) on Feb 14, 2017 at 7:36pm PST\n\nWhatever A post shared by Liam Hemsworth (@liamhemsworth) on Dec 26, 2016 at 12:53am PST\n\nIt seems like Miley and Tish are in agreement about not rushing into a legal binding marriage.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so happy, and she\u2019s always like, \u2018I don\u2019t know why everybody wants us to get married. It\u2019s so perfect.'\u201d You know what they say \u2014 if it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\n\nRegardless \u2014 we\u2019re sure shippers will still freak out whenever they see Miley wearing white. Like that one time Miley\u2019s dad Billy Ray Cyrus posted a photo of his daughter wearing white with the caption, \u201cI\u2019m so happy\u2026you are happy @mileycyrus.\u201d Everyone was convinced Billy Ray just witnessed his daughter get married, but that was soo not the case.\n\nI'm so happy...you are happy @mileycyrus. A post shared by Billy Ray Cyrus (@billyraycyrus) on Mar 9, 2017 at 5:05pm PST\n\nMiley\u2019s dad later had to clarify that Miley was NOT getting married, and that he simply was just stating that he\u2019s happy for her. Because, ya know, women can look happy in white dresses without having to get married. Miley is probably enjoying her successful career as a musician \u2014 and as she should, girl hustles and works hard.\n\nWhoa! Don't jump the gun. Been at work #StillTheKing Glad to see so many love @MileyCyrus the same as I do #happy A post shared by Billy Ray Cyrus (@billyraycyrus) on Mar 11, 2017 at 9:22am PST\n\nAs long as Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are happy together, how \u201cofficial\u201d their relationship is shouldn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re just glad to see those two kids back in each other\u2019s lives.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170829021112im_/http://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hg/images/newsletter-illustration.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829021112im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/28052313/redcarpet-350x350.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829021112im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/06/24024452/mileyliam-700x525.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829021112im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/06/24024452/mileyliam.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829021112im_/http://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hg/images/illustrations/3.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829021112im_/http://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hg/images/xoxo.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829021112im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/06/24024452/mileyliam.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dasha Fayvinova"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829021112/http://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/miley-cyruss-mom-doesnt-get-everyone-wants-daughter-marry-liam-hemsworth/", "title": "Miley Cyrus's mom doesn't get why everyone wants her daughter to marry Liam Hemsworth", "meta_data": {"fb": {"admins": 100001889240714, "pages": 209123339112078}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@hellogiggles", "creator": "@@TheDasha92", "title": "Miley Cyrus\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t get why everyone wants her daughter to marry Liam Hemsworth", "description": "This is what Miley Cyrus's mom has to say about Liam Hemsworth", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829021112im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/06/24024452/mileyliam-376x283.png"}, "description": "While everyone else seems to be on board with wedding bells, Miley Cyrus's mom doesn't get why everyone wants Miley to marry Liam.", "keywords": "miley cyrus, liam hemsworth, billy ray cyrus, Tish Cyrus, Miley Cyrus Malibu, Miley engaged, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth married,Celeb", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Miley Cyrus\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t get why everyone wants her daughter to marry Liam Hemsworth", "description": "This is what Miley Cyrus's mom has to say about Liam Hemsworth", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829021112/http://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/miley-cyruss-mom-doesnt-get-everyone-wants-daughter-marry-liam-hemsworth/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829021112im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/06/24024452/mileyliam.png", "width": 1102, "height": 858}}, "article": {"tag": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth married", "section": "Celeb", "published_time": "2017-06-24T09:46:51-07:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.8"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498322811.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
