The \u201cHands To Myself\u201d singer shocked the world when she revealed on Sept. 14 that her best friend Francia Raisa, 29, donated one of her kidneys to Selena after her Lupus condition required the operation earlier this summer. Justin found out just like the rest of her fans via her Instagram post about it because they just don\u2019t talk anymore.\n\n\u201cHe is hearing about this just as everyone is hearing about it. He\u2019s he is happy that she is okay, but he has no interest in contacting her to see how she is doing. This will not be a catalyst for them to talk again. He is generally happy she is okay, but that is all he wants to deal with right now when it comes to her,\u201d a source close to the Biebs tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. See pics from Selena\u2019s kidney transplant, here.\n\nEven though they both go to Hillsong Church, Selena kept word of her surgery super quiet and the news never made it back to Justin, according to TMZ. The site says that the pair actively keeps their distance at services. \u201cThey don\u2019t talk. Period,\u201d their source claims. Another source said, \u201cIt was a childhood thing. They\u2019ve both had other relationships. It\u2019s over.\u201d Isn\u2019t that the truth! Selena\u2019s been blissfully happy dating The Weeknd, 27, for nine months now and he was totally her \u201crock\u201d during the medical crisis. Even though the singer was on tour, he stayed in constant contact to make sure his lady was doing well. Oh man, how stressful that must have been! If these two can make it through something as serious as an organ transplant ordeal, there\u2019s nothing that can break their union.\n\nHollywoodLifers, would you donate a kidney to your BFF if they needed it?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/rexfeatures_9231673y.jpg?quality=100&w=293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/rexfeatures_9231673s-1.jpg?quality=100&w=440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/justin-bieber-had-no-idea-about-kidney-transplant-ftr.jpg?quality=100", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/selena-gomez-rex-gallery-05.jpg?quality=100&w=440"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/justin-bieber-had-no-idea-about-kidney-transplant-ftr.jpg?quality=100", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/09/14/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-kidney-transplant-surgery/", "title": "Why Justin Bieber Had No Idea Selena Gomez Had A Kidney Transplant", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Justin Bieber was totally in the dark about Selena Gomez's kidney transplant, as the two don't stay in touch anymore.", "google-site-verification": "-fFtY3InnBG-L4jhda35PWMnefeOSa7tU_YdarFQyIc", "news_keywords": "Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "auto-social": "always", "author": "Beth Shilliday", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Why Justin Bieber Had No Idea Selena Gomez Had A Kidney Transplant", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/09/14/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-kidney-transplant-surgery/", "description": "News that Selena Gomez underwent a kidney transplant earlier this summer shocked her fans, and it also took her ex Justin Bieber by surprise as well!
