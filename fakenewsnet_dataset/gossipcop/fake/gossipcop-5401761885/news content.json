However, the family maintains the show ended after she got a restraining order against Rob, making it difficult to film a show about them. Blac Chyna first filed the lawsuit back in October 2017. Just last month, Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian were tentatively dismissed from the case.\n\nRelated\n\nIt's not completely clear, TMZ notes, why the sisters were added back to the lawsuit. Though, allegedly, shady comments were made about the show by one or both of the women.\n\nAs for Kim and Kris, after they were tentatively dismissed, the judge did allow for Blac Chyna to someday create a new case against them in the future, should she want to do that.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/48/847/170727_3559065_Blac_Chyna___Rob_Kardashian_s_Relationship_T.jpg?itok=GvLEduck", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-021518-blac-chyna-kardashians.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/themes/custom/reality/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/rhom-lisa-hochstein_0.jpg?itok=qb_ygHZ4", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/sutton-stracke.jpg?itok=hhQduioE", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/bravolebs-chaos-dinner-party-fashion.jpg?itok=w6IPg42I"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-021518-blac-chyna-kardashians.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/blac-chynas-kardashian-lawsuit-update", "title": "Blac Chyna's Lawsuit Against the Kardashians: Khloe, Kylie Added", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1133873, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Blac Chyna's Lawsuit Against the Kardashians New Twist\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/02\\/dish-021518-blac-chyna-kardashians.jpg?itok=0ol01KkE\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/02\\/dish-021518-blac-chyna-kardashians.jpg?itok=uxRTt2bO\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/02\\/dish-021518-blac-chyna-kardashians.jpg?itok=XJmxveR2\",\"70x70\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/fp_scale_crop_70x70\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/02\\/dish-021518-blac-chyna-kardashians.jpg?itok=QfUPpck1\"}}", "description": "Blac Chyna's ongoing legal battle with the Kardashians has taken an interesting new turn as Rob Kardashian's ex and the mother of his child, Dream, has added Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner to", "og": {"site_name": "Bravo TV Official Site", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/blac-chynas-kardashian-lawsuit-update", "title": "Blac Chyna's Lawsuit Against the Kardashians Has Taken a New Twist | Bravo TV Official Site", "description": "Blac Chyna's ongoing legal battle with the Kardashians has taken an interesting new turn as Rob Kardashian's ex and the mother of his child, Dream, has added Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner to", "image": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-021518-blac-chyna-kardashians.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-15T10:54:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2023-10-12T14:49:02-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1592250694320227}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Blac Chyna's ongoing legal battle with the Kardashians has taken an interesting new turn as Rob Kardashian's ex and the mother of his child, Dream, has added Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner to", "site": "@bravotv", "title": "Blac Chyna's Lawsuit Against the Kardashians Has Taken a New Twist | Bravo TV Official Site", "url": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/blac-chynas-kardashian-lawsuit-update", "image": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-021518-blac-chyna-kardashians.jpg"}, "Generator": "Drupal 9 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "vertical_name": "The Daily Dish"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518710060.0, "source": "http://www.bravotv.com", "summary": ""}
