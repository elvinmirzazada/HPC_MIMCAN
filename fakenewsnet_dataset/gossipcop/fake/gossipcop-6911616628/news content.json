adopting her second child (a little girl named Laila!)\n\nWhen asked if she could see herself getting married again, the 51-year-old Oscar winner responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think so, but I can see myself in a committed, safe relationship where there is lots of love and laughter, and \u2018making memories\u2019 is No. 1 on the to-do list.\u201d\n\nSandra is reportedly currently dating photographer Bryan Randall (who actually photographed the cover story spread for People mag\u2019s reveal).\n\nSandra also was asked if her family, including son Louis, 5, was traditional.\n\n\u201cIf a traditional home is one that is filled with lots of love and poop jokes, no sleep, schedule books filled with more kids\u2019 social events than adults\u2019 and lots of yelling over who touched who first \u2026 then I have a very traditional family,\u201d Sandra added.\n\nPictured inside: Sandra\u2018s boyfriend Bryan out on a photo shoot in Hollywood on Sunday (December 6).", "images":
