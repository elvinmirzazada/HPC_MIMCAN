News she\u2019s thrilled her ex-boyfriend found love with Nikki Reed. (The couple tied the knot April 26 in Malibu, California.)\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about the wedding, I thought it was beautiful. They look happy, and I am happy, and so I don\u2019t see why there should be a problem with that,\u201d Dobrev said. \u201cThe drama is in the media, it\u2019s not with us. But, of course, we\u2019re on a teen drama show, everyone\u2019s going to look for drama. If there\u2019s no drama, there\u2019s nothing to write about. I just ignore it.\u201d\n\nDobrev, 26, and Somerhalder, 36, split in 2013 after about three years together.\n\n\u201cI love him, and the friendship is still strong, and I think he\u2019s great, and I care about him,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that didn\u2019t change. Yes, we\u2019re professional, and that\u2019s fine. We were friends long before we dated, and we still are now.\u201d\n\nNina Dobrev: Ian Somerhalder And Nikki Reed s Wedding \u2018Was Beautiful\u2019\n\nFor more on Dobrev\u2019s Vampire Diaries exit ,
