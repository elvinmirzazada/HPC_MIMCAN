We have so much more to hash out,\u201d Kim told the camera, adding that she felt like they were all \u201cwalking on egg shells.\u201d\n\nMaking things worse? Kourtney didn\u2019t want Scott Disick, the father of her three children, invited to Kris\u2019 annual blowout \u2014 because then-boyfriend Younes Bendjima would be there.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still part of our family,\u201d Kris insisted.\n\n\u201cWhat about my dad?\u201d Kendall Jenner interjected, referring to Caitlyn Jenner, who\u2019d fallen out with Kris and the Kardashian girls following the publication of her explosive memoir.\n\n\u201cNobody thats coming would even know how to respond to her,\u201d Kris argued, adding that she has a friendly relationship with Scott and wanted him present.\n\n\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t have a relationship with my dad for 25 years?\u201d Kendall asked angrily.\n\nBut Kim and Khlo\u00e9 were on Scott\u2019s side.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Attend Sister Therapy with Kourtney After Calling Her a \u2018Raging Bitch\u2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care that Kourtney has a boyfriend. I have a girlfriend. i don\u2019t give a s\u2014,\u201d he told them later. (He\u2019s been dating Sofia Richie since the fall.)\n\nMeanwhile, Kourtney found an ally in Kendall.\n\n\u201cIt should be Younes going to the party and Scott coming to Christmas morning,\u201d Kendall said, adding that it \u201cblew my mind\u201d how her mom and sisters didn\u2019t recognize that banning Caitlyn yet welcoming Scott was hypocritical.\n\n\u201cWhy is Scott coming to the party more important than my feelings?\u201d Kourtney asked, mentioning that she was considering taking her kids out of town for the holiday to avoid drama.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not okay,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 said when Kendall relayed the news.\n\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s like a cry for help, a cry for attention? Is she the new Rob?\u201d Kim asked.\n\nKourtney brought Kendall to an ice-skating trip with her kids, and they discussed the rift further.\n\n\u201cYou have to spend Christmas with us,\u201d Kendall said.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to get along if we\u2019re all in the same place,\u201d Kourtney replied. \u201cThe meanness and stuff, it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\n\nLuckily, Kendall convinced her to stick around Calabasas. \u201cI think you guys should make up and not worry about it, because it\u2019s the holidays,\u201d she said\n\nAnd when Kourtney realized she wanted her kids to be around their cousins and aunts, she agreed.\n\nSo, she decided to talk to Scott directly about her concerns.\n\n\u201cI heard through the grapevine you\u2019re the one person who doesn\u2019t want me to go,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that our lives are changing,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my boyfriend is going to the party, if you\u2019re there, I just don\u2019t want any disrespect. I\u2019ve been feeling super anxious \u2026 but I don\u2019t want the kids to not have their dad there.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Scott and Younes both attended, and even Caitlyn was invited, though she skipped out on the festivities.\n\n\u201cNot sharing this whole experience with my family and my kids, it wouldn\u2019t have felt right,\u201d Kourtney concluded, adding that getting in the Christmas spirit helped her resolve her issues with her sisters.", "images":
