However, days after Foxx was seen getting cozy with another woman, reports broke today that he and Holmes had actually been separated for months.\n\nHere, take a look back at all of the key moments in Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx's secretive courtship, from how they met to their secretive split.\n\n2004: Foxx works with Tom Cruise on Collateral.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBefore Cruise meets and marries Holmes, he works with Foxx on the movie Collateral.

She is seen chatting to Foxx on the field, who is clearly an acquaintance, as she attends the game with Cruise.\n\nJune 29, 2012: Holmes files for divorce from Tom Cruise.\n\nCruise's rep releases a statement (reported via Yahoo!) which says, \"Kate has filed for divorce and Tom is deeply saddened and is concentrating on his three children. Please allow them their privacy.\" CBS reports that Cruise is blindsided by the divorce, and tells a German television station, \"I didn't expect it.\"\n\n\n\nAugust 2013: Foxx and Holmes are seen dancing together in the Hamptons.\n\nOver a year after Holmes has separated from Cruise, rumors about a new relationship start when Holmes and Foxx are spotted at the same event in the Hamptons.

'Katie just couldn\u2019t get over her trust issues.'\"\n\nHowever, Holmes's rep tells People, \"The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,\" which appears to confirm that the relationship is still on.\n\nRelated Story Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Hold Hands in Rare PDA\n\nDecember 2018: They show PDA in Miami.\n\nFoxx and Holmes were seen kissing on a luxury yacht and racing on wave runners together in Miami, FL ahead of New Year's Eve.
