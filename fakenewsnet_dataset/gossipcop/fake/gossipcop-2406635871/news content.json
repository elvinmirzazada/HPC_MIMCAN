The Stranger Things couple on and off screen started dating in October 2016 before going public about a year later, but they allegedly just couldn\u2019t make it work. \u201cCharlie broke it off with Natalia. She\u2019s heartbroken. She doesn\u2019t know what went wrong,\u201d a source told Life & Style. Poor Natalia! HollywoodLife.com has reached out to both Charlie and Natalia\u2019s reps on this report.\n\nThe reported breakup was amicable, but obviously Natalia\u2019s hurt. To make it sting worse, she thinks Charlie\u2019s allegedly rubbing it in her face by very publicly partying and having fun without her. \u201cPartying with his sister [has] been a kick in the teeth for Natalia,\u201d the source said. \u201cShe\u2019s basically been pushed aside without a second thought.\u201d\n\nBreakups are always awful, but if Natalia and Charlie did split, it\u2019s going to be extra awkward. The two actors play lovebirds and partners in ass-kicking Jonathan and Nancy on Stranger Things. The third season of the show hasn\u2019t even started filming, and there\u2019s no indication that their characters will break up. They finally just got together in season 2! But, they\u2019re professionals; they would be able to make it. It\u2019s not the first time that costars have broken up and still played TV lovers (*cough* One Tree Hill), and it wouldn\u2019t be the last.\n\nNatalia stood by Charlie\u2019s side when he was stopped at customs at LAX coming into the United States (he\u2019s British) because his luggage reportedly had traces of cocaine. He was not arrested or charged with a crime, but it was still a public snafu. He apologized to his family and Stranger Things cast members, including Natalia. This situation is just the worst!", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/stranger-things-star-natalia-dyer-looks-gorgeous-in-floral-dress-at-event-with-costar-bf-charlie-heaton-gal.jpg?quality=100&w=440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/unnamed-237.jpg?quality=100&w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/unnamed-237.jpg?quality=100", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Natalia-Dyer-BF-Charlie-Heaton-ss.jpg?quality=100&w=293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/shutterstock_editorial_12639321db.jpg?quality=100&w=293"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/unnamed-237.jpg?quality=100", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Wilson"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/14/did-charlie-heaton-natalia-dyer-break-up-stranger-things-dating-split/", "title": "Did Charlie Heaton & Natalia Dyer Break Up? \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Couple Reportedly Split Before Season 3", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Did Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer break up?", "google-site-verification": "-fFtY3InnBG-L4jhda35PWMnefeOSa7tU_YdarFQyIc", "news_keywords": "Charlie Heaton, Natalia Dyer, Stranger Things", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "auto-social": "always", "author": "Samantha Wilson", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Did Charlie Heaton & Natalia Dyer Break Up? \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Couple Reportedly Split Before Season 3", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/14/did-charlie-heaton-natalia-dyer-break-up-stranger-things-dating-split/", "description": "Not Jonathan and Nancy!
