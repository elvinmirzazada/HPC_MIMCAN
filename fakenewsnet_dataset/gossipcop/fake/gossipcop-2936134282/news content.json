(Yes, #JustinPeeber was a thing.)\n\nBut the \u201cLove Yourself\u201d singer has a totally reasonable explanation.\n\nLate in the evening on Thursday, Biebs set the record straight about the source of the stain. \u201cSomeone got me flowers and I was driving, made a turn, and the water spilled on my d\u2014 area,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nYou ain't cool unless you pee your pants A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Feb 23, 2017 at 12:58pm PST\n\nWhile most celebrities might have been peed-off about the embarrassing photos, Bieber has a good sense of humor about it.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t bother me if it made ya laugh nice!\u201d he added.\n\nHe also took to his newly reinstated Instagram to joke about the photos, posting a meme comparing his soaked sweatpants to the wet pants Adam Sandler rocked in Billy Madison.\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t cool unless you pee your pants,\u201d Bieber wrote \u2014 quoting the scene from the 1995, in which Sandler pretends to pee his pants to so that school bullies will stop teasing another kid who actually did pee his pants.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Justin Bieber Says the Weeknd\u2019s Music Is \u2018Wack\u2019 Following Selena Gomez Romance Rumors\n\nBieber is apparently a big fan of 1990s comedies. On Valentine\u2019s Day, he quoted 1994\u2019s Dumb and Dumber on his Instagram Story \u2014 admitting he didn\u2019t have \u201cSomebody to Love\u201d for the romantic holiday.\n\n\u201cI got no food, I got no job, our pets heads are falling off and I got no Valentine!\u201d he said, adding his own spin to highlight his single status.", "images":
