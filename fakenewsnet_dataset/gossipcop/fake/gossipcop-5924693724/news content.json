{"url": "ew.com/article/2016/07/29/crazy-stupid-love-ryan-gosling-emma-stone-chemistry/", "text": "Crazy, Stupid, Love. tells the story of a middle-aged husband, Cal (Steve Carell), who turns to a 30-something ladies\u2019 man, Jacob (Ryan Gosling), for help hitting on girls at bars after his wife, Emily (Julianne Moore), asks for a divorce. Cal and Emily\u2019s relationship is at the center of the film, but so, too, is that of Jacob and Hannah (Emma Stone), who just so happens to be Cal and Emily\u2019s daughter.\n\nHannah pulls Jacob away from his womanizing ways and into monogamy, and together they are absolutely adorable. Credit that to the insane, amazing chemistry of Gosling and Stone, a dynamic duo that continues to captivate filmmakers and audiences alike. Following Crazy, Stupid, Love., which was directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the pair were brought back together for 2013\u2019s Gangster Squad; later this year, they\u2019ll appear as the romantic leads in La La Land.\n\nFive years after Crazy, Stupid, Love.\u2019s release, Ficarra tells EW what he remembers about casting Gosling and Stone, what made each right for their roles, why he thinks they continue to be cast together, and more. (You know we had to ask about the play on Dirty Dancing, and the heart-melting dialog-heavy scene that followed.) Read on for how Gosling and Stone came to be our favorite rom-com couple, and much more.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Looking back on auditions, what was it about Ryan and Emma together that worked so well for you?\n\nGLENN FICARRA: It was very evident very early. We had narrowed down to a few incredibly talented candidates for Emma\u2019s part. They all read with Ryan, [who] was off screen, and I think in most cases they were a little taken by Ryan\u2019s presence, so nervous at the sight of Ryan. When Emma came in, she sat down, she was ready to go; Ryan walked in, immediately flubbed his first line, and she just laid into him, like, \u201cOh, you\u2019re killing this buddy.\u201d She was the only one not to be intimidated by him, and in that moment John and I knew, \u201cAll right this is it, she\u2019s right for the part.\u201d She continued that, and they just got along really well. They have a very similar sense of humor\u2026 they riff off each other really well.\n\nWhat was it about Ryan that made him right for the role of Jacob?\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you work with Ryan? We had heard that he was interested. We were surprised because at that point he really hadn\u2019t done any substantial comedy. I found that his role in Lars and the Real Girl was a comic performance, but a lot of people read it as drama; you could see in the movie, the timing, it\u2019s all there. He was really interested in doing a comedy, and we thought he could really access the character, and so we met; we talked for a really long time, and Steve met him too. We were all like, \u201cOf course, no brainer.\u201d He\u2019s a really funny guy naturally. No one had seen that side of him before.\n\nYou talked about why Emma was a good match for Ryan, but can you expand on why she fit the bill as Hannah?\n\nIf I remember correctly she wasn\u2019t exactly what was described on paper, but John and I had both been taken with her in Superbad and then in Zombieland. It felt inevitable that she was going to hit. Her wit is sharp and it played into what we thought of the character as being \u2014 too smart for that kind of guy and almost too smart for herself, where she can get a little ahead of herself because her mouth and mind works a little bit faster than she\u2019s expecting.\n\nThat all played into Emma and the way she really is. She comes across as much older, and definitely wasn\u2019t technically the right age. I think she was too young when we were casting, but we were pretty confident she could play older and she\u2019s phenomenally talented. I was sitting next to her in between takes when we were shooting one of the bar scenes. She got the news that she got her first magazine cover and she was over the moon. I was like \u2018Oh, wow, what\u2019s going on?\u2019 She goes \u2018Oh, I got this movie coming out, Easy A.\u2019 The rest is history.\n\nA big moment for the two of them in the film is when Jacob lifts Hannah, Dirty Dancing style. It\u2019s super charming, but also sort of sexy. How did that scene come together, and what do you remember about shooting it?\n\nThat was not in the script. That was Ryan\u2019s idea. He mentioned he knew that move, and he wanted to do it. He took ballet as a kid and is a musical guy, so he was very confident doing that. That came out of a lot of conversations with Ryan and [writer] Dan Fogelman. Dan took the ball and ran with it and it\u2019s fantastic. That\u2019s where the really great scenes come from, ideas kind of whip around the room and next thing you know\u2026 and those are real nerves. Emma was really nervous he was going to drop her. She played into it all. It was really great.\n\nThey\u2019re also so great together in the dialog-heavy scenes. Right after the Dirty Dancing bit, they go to the bedroom and talk all night. What did the two of them bring to those quieter moments?\n\nThat was all improv. They did a couple scripted lines interspersed. The crew, I think, thought John and I were crazy because we said we were going to throw the script away. We were going to stick them in a bed together and keep shooting. We shot for a really long time. We let them go, we let them talk about whatever they wanted, we poured a couple of drinks, and they just riffed. They really amuse each other in real life. At one point, I think it was Ryan came up to me, he was like, \u201cIs this okay, what we\u2019re doing? I\u2019m not sure.\u201d I was like, \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s going to be great. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nThey were making each other laugh and we\u2019d throw lines at them, throw scenarios at them. The thing about the massage chair, I think that might have been in the script, so we had a massage chair we stuck in the garage, went down there and shot that. Originally in the script, it was a montage over several weeks of them falling in love. It seemed clich\u00e9 to do the walking-on-sunshine love montage, and we thought it would be a little more novel if the first night was kind of love at first sight. It\u2019s a tall order to ask the actors \u2014 \u201cOkay, you guys just met, and you have to basically fall in love\u201d \u2014 and they totally pull it off.\n\nIt feels very real, the love they show on screen.\n\nThey love each other in real life, and they get on like a house on fire. It wasn\u2019t a lot of heavy lifting on our part. It\u2019s making a move to hire the right chemistry.\n\nWhat else stands out to you about their performances in the film?\n\nThey\u2019re so much fun to work with, willing to try anything. They both like to laugh, so that\u2019s a great plus when you\u2019re doing a comedy, but they\u2019re not outside the characters because they\u2019re serious actors. I remember working with Emma on one of the scenes with Josh Groban. She went to this dramatic place when she realizes that she doesn\u2019t want to marry him. I remember being totally taken off guard by how deep she went. You could see it in her eyes. I remember turning to John and going, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be a phenomenal dramatic actress. I would love to see her in a drama or direct her in one.\u201d Consequently, she\u2019s top of our list all the time.\n\nEmma and Ryan have gone on to take roles in Gangster Squad, and they have La La Land coming up (due Dec. 16). How do you think they\u2019ve translated into other films? Why do you think they have such staying power as a cast-able couple?\n\nJohn and I are always kicking ourselves. When we were working with them we kept talking to people about how we have to put them in another movie together, so everybody took the idea. We should\u2019ve kept our mouths shut. Again, they have great chemistry, and they have fun together. I think it shows in everything they do. I haven\u2019t seen La La Land yet, but I hear it\u2019s fantastic; I have some friends who worked on it. Knowing Ryan and Emma, [with] Gangster Squad, the chance to re-do that era I think was really appealing to them. I think La La Land was a challenge as a musical, and I know Ryan loves dance and Emma\u2019s just such an all-around entertainer. It\u2019s going to be fantastic. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be the last time they work together.", "images":
