Reportedly, Amber Rose asked a Miami club not play the music of her exes\u2014those would be Kanye West and Wiz Khalifa (and Machine Gun Kelly).\n\nReports Page Six:\n\nWe hear Rose hosted a bash at Ora nightclub, and requested no songs by Kanye West or Wiz Khalifa be played. \u201cRose was specific in asking for no Kanye, and definitely no Wiz songs. She wanted the night to be about herself and she succeeded,\u201d a spy said. She was seen in town with rapper French Montana.\n\nWait, is French Montana on the body list now, too?! This guy.\n\nOkay, they\u2019re just friends. Carry on.\n\nUPDATE: Rose says the report is not true (see on the flip).\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BUDDc-MhHR7/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BUDVYl5Bm_k/\n\n\u2014\n\nPhoto: WENN.com\n\n1 2Next page \u00bb", "images": ["https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/16976396907574.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=150&crop=0,0,100,150px", "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/11/17006965428046.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=350&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C200px", "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/11/17001016428302-e1700101756258.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=150&crop=0,0,100,150px", "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/11/17011979517992.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=1024&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C683px", "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/11/17011979517992.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=150&crop=0,0,100,150px", "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/16971431745117.png?strip=all&quality=85&w=150&crop=0,0,100,150px", "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/10/16964483542497.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=150&crop=0,0,100,150px", "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/11/17000649926061.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=150&crop=0,0,100,150px", "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/11/17001940100586.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=150&crop=0,0,100,150px", "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/11/17009398349598.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=150&crop=0,0,100,150px", "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/01/151620727635021-e1516418440863.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=1012&crop=0,0,100,930px"], "top_img": "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2018/01/151620727635021-e1516418440863.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=1012&crop=0,0,100,930px", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robert Longfellow"], "canonical_link": "https://hiphopwired.com/543661/amber-rose-asked-club-not-play-songs-exes/", "title": "Amber Rose Asked Club Not To Play Songs By Her Exes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Amber Rose Asked Club Not To Play Songs By Her Exes", "description": "This story might be absolutely false, but it\u2019s deliciously petty.
