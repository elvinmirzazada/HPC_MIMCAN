Which is fair enough, really.\n\n\"So many people think that taking so many selfies is just ridiculous,\" she says. \"For me, what's so funny is I love taking pictures and posting them on social media for memories.\n\n\"I'm kind of letting them know, yes, it is ridiculous, but it's all fun. I can look at a photo on social media and see a picture and know exactly where I was by the outfit I had on or who I was with. I take it more as a fun, emotional scrapbook that I love to look back on.\"\n\nIn fact, Kim says she took her first selfie way back in 1984 when she was just five years old and, just like the rest of us, remembers the days when you had to lug an actual camera around with you.\n\nBear Grylls // Digital Spy\n\nSo, why is she covering Adweek?
