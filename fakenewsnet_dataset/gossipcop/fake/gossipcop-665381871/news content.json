Did the photos of them cuddling signify that they were dating, or were they just collaborating on new music? How much could one read into reports that they spent New Year\u2019s together, and he was buying her at least one of the rocks that she got? And how did this all end so that she could embark on a new relationship with fellow New York City treasure Alex Rodriguez?\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nNow, there are some answers: Drake dropped his album More Life on Saturday night, and E.W. reports that Lopez is all over it, but not on it exactly. \u201cGet It Together,\u201d which first \u201cleaked\u201d to the public when TMZ published videos of J.Lo and Drake at a prom-themed party, dancing to the song, sounded as though it featured Lopez\u2019s vocals. British singer Jorja Smith is the one singing on the final version, though.\n\nMore pointedly still, \u201cTeenage Fever\u201d samples the entire hook from \u201cIf You Had My Love,\u201d Lopez\u2019s 1999 hit from her first album, On the 6, but slows it down so it\u2019s more somber. Is that a dig? Or is that the collaboration part that they were hinting at all along?\n\nThe most pointed reference to Jenny from the Block arrived on the opening track \u201cFree Smoke,\u201d in which he raps, \u201cMiraval to the face\u201d (i.e., Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u2019s shared wine label that specializes in ros\u00e9), followed by, \u201cI drunk text J. Lo / Old number so it bounce back.\u201d How perfectly Drake that he learns he\u2019s been rejected by Lopez via a passive number change while tipsy on ros\u00e9. Almost too Drake, really.\n\nThis was the problem all along. The stories circling these two were on the nose, a little too convenient for drumming up album excitement. Their matching intimate Instagrams arrived too suddenly with not enough confirmed clarity from either camp.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fe7ae5f9f2d6c81700a52e/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58a119271fce8b83738d9d25/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/beyonce-performance-grammys-2017.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5898b79b1eeeaa1f3b7f600f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/pregnant-performers-kelly-clarkson.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6566170fa07f97a6dc41374c/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c17c3a208b4945c3920cfa/1:1/pass/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-dating.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660f10fa28999da8edabc8/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65563745811fa04e15f2edbd/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c9acdc55c69a50ab88e702/1:1/pass/Jennifer-Lopez-Alex-Rodriguez.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5898b79b1eeeaa1f3b7f6010/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/pregnant-performers-alicia-keys.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/656510d0affa7b4408631071/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5682b3cd2c593fd3139281d6/1:1/pass/year-in-drake-memes.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Kenzie Bryant", "Josh Duboff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/03/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-more-life-album", "title": "Drake, Jennifer Lopez, and Alex Rodriguez: The Lopsided Love Triangle", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "One woman and two rumored relationships, not a Y.A. novel.", "id": "58cfeff60990073437620952", "keywords": "jennifer lopez,alex rodriguez,drake,more life,vanities", "news_keywords": "jennifer lopez,alex rodriguez,drake,more life,vanities", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58cfeff60990073437620952", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"One woman and two rumored relationships, not a Y.A. novel.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "One woman and two rumored relationships, not a Y.A. novel.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Drake, Jennifer Lopez, and Alex Rodriguez: The Lopsided Love Triangle", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/03/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-more-life-album"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-03-20T18:36:40.208Z", "modified_time": "2017-03-20T18:36:40.208Z", "author": "Kenzie Bryant"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "One woman and two rumored relationships, not a Y.A. novel.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Drake, Jennifer Lopez, and Alex Rodriguez: The Lopsided Love Triangle"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1490035000.208, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
