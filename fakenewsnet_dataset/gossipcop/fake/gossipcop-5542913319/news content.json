Over the weekend, she shared an Instagram video of her trip to the doctor\u2019s office, and she was straight-up terrified of getting poked with a needle. Like, she really wasn\u2019t having it.\n\nThe visit was for a routine check-up, and even though she\u2019s a fan of tattoos, this type of needlework is definitely not her favorite. She might be well on her way to conquering the world, but that doesn\u2019t make her immune to irrational fears, not being able to fall asleep at night included.\n\nAt least Sel\u2019s hate of needles and insomnia gets us some hilarious Instagram videos though, right? This is basically us every single time we have a little too much sugar before bed. No more fro-yo past 9pm, guys.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nRelated:\n\nWatch Selena Gomez Rap This Drake Track Like a Boss\n\nAbigail Breslin Has Some Thoughts About Selena Gomez\u2019s Vacation Photos\n\nSelena Gomez Just Cut Her Hair", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/65440c37390f7f3a096b0b5e/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6554dabc0c9c314c5413f528/1:1/pass/undefined", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/558308f4c3f29bdf1f2b3855/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/entertainment-2015-05-selena-gomez-doctor-th.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/55ce6df609459990134a82b1/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/654121465161e7ee2c52fc1c/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/654529d55ad4271b80603346/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/558308f4c3f29bdf1f2b3855/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/entertainment-2015-05-selena-gomez-doctor-th.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Alyse Whitney"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-doctors-office", "title": "You and Selena Gomez Probably Have One Big Thing in Common", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "You and Selena Gomez probably have one big thing in common.", "id": "558308f4fb1995762be2a4dd", "keywords": "news,selena gomez", "news_keywords": "news,selena gomez", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "558308f4fb1995762be2a4dd", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"You and Selena Gomez probably have one big thing in common.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/558308f4c3f29bdf1f2b3855/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/entertainment-2015-05-selena-gomez-doctor-th.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/558308f4c3f29bdf1f2b3855/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/entertainment-2015-05-selena-gomez-doctor-th.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "We feel ya, Sel.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/558308f4c3f29bdf1f2b3855/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/entertainment-2015-05-selena-gomez-doctor-th.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "You and Selena Gomez Probably Have One Big Thing in Common", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-doctors-office"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2015-05-11T11:52:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-11T11:52:00.000Z", "author": "Alyse Whitney"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "We feel ya, Sel.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/558308f4c3f29bdf1f2b3855/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/entertainment-2015-05-selena-gomez-doctor-th.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "You and Selena Gomez Probably Have One Big Thing in Common"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/558308f4c3f29bdf1f2b3855/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/entertainment-2015-05-selena-gomez-doctor-th.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1431345120.0, "source": "http://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
