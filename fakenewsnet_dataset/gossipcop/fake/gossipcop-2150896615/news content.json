But on Friday, photographers saw the aftermath of what looked like a nasty argument between the two, who have been together since 1983 but never walked down the aisle. Look at RadarOnline.com 's gallery of Hawn and Russell's surprising dustup.\n\nHawn, 71, left her Malibu house looking angry after an apparent disagreement with Russell, 65. The usually bubbly former Laugh-In star was clearly in no laughing mood as she scowled while walking to her white Range Rover.\n\nLooking disheveled as she wore a sloppy sweater and no makeup, Hawn reached up to slam her car's trunk in disgust after the incident.\n\nOn Britain's ITV chat show, Loose Women, Hawn said she and Russell \"would have been long divorced\" if they had wed.\n\nHawn has said she and the rugged Escape from New York star \"liked the choice\" of not marrying each other. However they did have a son, Wyatt , together.\n\nThe star who had a big hit with Private Benjamin doesn't look camera ready as, in her obvious anger, she forgot to close her car door. Hawn was driving through Malibu when she realized her mistake and pulled over to slam the passenger side shut.\n\nShortly after Hawn left, Russell emerged from the house and stared at a traffic cone wedged under his GMC truck. He drove away with the cone still stuck under the vehicle.\n\nHawn and Russell are going into their golden years together and both look great for their age. The giggly gal is never afraid of showing off her body at Hollywood events or on vacation, as RadarOnline.com's photo have shown.\n\nWhile they've stood the test of time, Hawn has admitted that celebrities may have \"a harder time\" with relationships because \"the cameras are on them all the time.\" Indeed!\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
