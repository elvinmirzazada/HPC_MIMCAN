And you're in an art gallery? And you're an artist?\" she asks. \"This is amazing!\"\n\nTrying to connect with her new artist pal, she then asks, \"Are you going to Art Basel again this year?\" to which he responded, \"Absolutely.\"\n\nIn case you missed it, in another clip released earlier this week, Khloe accuses her mom of \"art shaming\" her when Kris suggests she go to an art class after she inquires about a piece of artwork in Kris' office.\n\n\"Just because I'm not as knowledgeable as you, you shouldn't turn your nose up,\" Khloe argues. \"You should be like, 'Well Khloe, Jeff Koons is\u2026' instead of making me feel less than and uneducated.\"\n\n\"You can't art shame people just because they know less than you,\" she continues. \"I'm your f**king daughter and you're art shaming me and it's mean.\"\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on E! In the meantime, watch the video below to hear the nicer things Kris has said about her daughter in a recent interview with ET.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-07%2Fkriskylie.jpg%3Fh%3D9db51067&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-08/gettyimages-1025492630.jpg?h=0ec75886&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/scott_disick_450148290.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2Fscott_disick_450148290.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-08%2Fkris-jenner-youtube.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-08%2Fkriskhloe.jpg%3Fh%3Dd3ca253d&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/scott_disick_450148290.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/scott-disick-hires-fake-artist-to-prank-kris-jenner-as-revenge-for-art-shaming-khloe-kardashian", "title": "Scott Disick Hires Fake Artist to Prank Kris Jenner as Revenge for 'Art Shaming' Khloe Kardashian", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/scott_disick_450148290.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "In a sneak peek clip from Sunday's 'KUWTK', the reality star pulls an epic prank on the famous momager.", "title": "Scott Disick Hilariously Pranks Kris Jenner -- Watch!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/scott-disick-hires-fake-artist-to-prank-kris-jenner-as-revenge-for-art-shaming-khloe-kardashian", "type": "Article"}, "description": "In a sneak peek clip from Sunday's 'KUWTK', the reality star pulls an epic prank on the famous momager.", "twitter": {"description": "In a sneak peek clip from Sunday's 'KUWTK', the reality star pulls an epic prank on the famous momager.", "title": "Scott Disick Hilariously Pranks Kris Jenner -- Watch!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/scott-disick-hires-fake-artist-to-prank-kris-jenner-as-revenge-for-art-shaming-khloe-kardashian", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/scott_disick_450148290.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Scott Disick Hires Fake Artist to Prank Kris Jenner as Revenge for 'Art Shaming' Khloe Kardashian | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, News, TV, Scott Disick, Khloe Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Keeping Up With The Kardashians", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
