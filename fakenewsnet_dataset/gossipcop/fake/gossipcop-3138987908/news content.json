Keep scrolling to find out what cosmetic procedures she\u2019s had done over the years.\n\nHas Priscilla Presley Undergone Plastic Surgery?\n\nThe mother of two has spoken out about the botched cosmetic procedures she\u2019s had done in the past. Her spokesperson claimed that she unknowingly had industrial low-grade silicone \u2014 similar to what mechanics use to grease car parts \u2014 injected into her face by a doctor who wasn\u2019t licensed to practice medicine in the U.S.\n\n\u201cPriscilla Presley was one of many documented victims of Dr. Daniel Serrano,\u201d the actress\u2019 rep shared in 2008. \u201cAn investigation which uncovered his misconduct ultimately led to his imprisonment. Ms. Presley dealt with this matter years ago and everything is now well.\u201d\n\nSerrano, who wasn\u2019t licensed to practice medicine in the U.S., was deported to Argentina after serving 18 months in federal prison. Some of his injections caused lumps, paralysis and holes in his clients\u2019 faces.\n\nSipa/Shutterstock\n\nWhat Was Priscilla Presley\u2019s Life Like With Elvis?\n\nThe former Dallas star met music icon Elvis Presley in 1959 during a party at his home in Germany when the legendary singer was serving overseas in the U.S. Army. Her stepfather was a member of the U.S. Air Force stationed there at the time. The two kept in touch and Priscilla eventually moved to Elvis\u2019 home in Memphis, Tennessee, to be with him in 1963.\n\nThe pair wed on May 1, 1967, in a brief Las Vegas ceremony when she was 21 years old. The couple welcomed their only child, daughter Lisa Marie Presley, on February 1, 1968. Elvis and Priscilla were only married for four years, separating in 1972 and divorcing the following year.\n\nMoviestore/Shutterstock\n\nPriscilla would be the King of Rock and Roll\u2019s only wife, as he tragically died on August 16, 1977, at the age of 42 after suffering a heart attack at his Memphis home, Graceland.\n\nOver the years, Priscilla has helped keep Elvis\u2019 memory alive with his fans. She led the celebration for what would have been the singer\u2019s 75th birthday on January 8, 2010, with a large party at Graceland. Lisa Marie and her children, Riley and Benjamin Keough, were there to honor the grandfather they never met.\n\nPriscilla and Lisa Marie were heavily involved in director Baz Lurhmann\u2018s 2022 biopic, Elvis, based on the singer\u2019s life and his close connection to his manager, Col. Tom Parker. Both of the ladies were in the audience for the 2023 Golden Globe Awards to watch star Austin Butler win the award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture: Drama. Austin told Priscilla and Lisa in his acceptance speech, \u201cThank you for opening your hearts, your memories, your home to me,\u201d adding, \u201cLisa Marie, Priscilla, I love you forever.\u201d\n\nScroll down to see her transformation over the years.", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/shutterstock_editorial_742698c.jpg?fit=400%2C614&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C614", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Copy-of-Single-Bubble-White-10.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C2400px%2C1261px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Copy-of-Single-Bubble-White-10.jpg?crop=0px%2C7px%2C2400px%2C1359px&resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Copy-of-Single-Bubble-White-10.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C2400px%2C1261px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/priscilla-presley-plastic-surgery-103194/", "title": "Did Priscilla Presley Get Plastic Surgery?
