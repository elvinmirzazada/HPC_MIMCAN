I\u2019m not 18, or 19, or 20. I cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn\u2019t right. But that doesn\u2019t mean caring for someone ever goes away.\u201d\n\nThat goes for \u201cpeople in general,\u201d she added. \u201cI mean, I grew up with Demi [Lovato]. Nick and Joe [Jonas] and Miley [Cyrus] \u2014 we\u2019ve gone through seasons in our lives. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as serious as people make things out to be half the time. It\u2019s just my life. I grew up with all of these people, and it\u2019s so cool to see where everybody is. It comes back to the idea of me remaining full. I think a true representation of love is beyond just yourself. \u2026 The littlest things are impactful.\u201d\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
