Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nKristen Wiig might be sticking her claws into Wonder Woman. According to Deadline, the Bridesmaids star is being considered to play Cheetah, a classic comic-book villain, in the upcoming highly anticipated movie sequel. Wiig, who is mostly known for her comedy chops, would be the adversary to Gal Gadot\u2019s Diana Prince. This time the superhero has skipped ahead in time from World War II to fight crime in the 1980s. Cheetah, who was originally depicted as the alter ego of a socialite, will probably fit right in with Reagan\u2019s America. Though, then again, since this is the Cold War she could suddenly become a Soviet. Patty Jenkins is also returning as the film\u2019s director.", "images": ["https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/7a4/a30/75f8858697b92dcf7d2fa4305d2ab756ff-succession-with-eyes-open.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.png", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b3d/336/bc7bcc6907915cf93226c8212d877b2c3e-cynthia-nixon.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e75/055/c0d568146f8824ed7a619cd514fca1aeb6-airbnb-alt-01.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/33f/174/776d396f08c2175a4688dfa94413b1e150-18-kristen-wig.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/33f/174/776d396f08c2175a4688dfa94413b1e150-18-kristen-wig.rsquare.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2e2/98e/99818d3d7a6a16d9c4b41dca7a9760ec10-2423Cov-4x5-CONFLICT.w240.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/33f/174/776d396f08c2175a4688dfa94413b1e150-18-kristen-wig.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tolly Wright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/kristen-wiig-might-play-the-villain-in-wonder-woman-2.html", "title": "Kristen Wiig Might Play the Villain in Wonder Woman 2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "kristen wiig, casting couch, wonder woman 2, wonder woman, gal gadot, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Kristen Wiig Might Play the Villain in Wonder Woman 2", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/kristen-wiig-might-play-the-villain-in-wonder-woman-2.html", "description": "She\u2019s reportedly in talks to play Cheetah.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/33f/174/776d396f08c2175a4688dfa94413b1e150-18-kristen-wig.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Kristen Wiig Might Play the Villain in Wonder Woman 2", "description": "She\u2019s reportedly in talks to play Cheetah.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/33f/174/776d396f08c2175a4688dfa94413b1e150-18-kristen-wig.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TollyW", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-28T20:32:00.435-05:00", "tag": "kristen wiig, casting couch, wonder woman 2, wonder woman, gal gadot", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Kristen Wiig may play Cheetah, a villain, in \u2018Wonder Woman 2\u2019, opposite Gal Gadot as Diana Prince.
