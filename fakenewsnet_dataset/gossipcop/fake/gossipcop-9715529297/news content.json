Travel + Leisure magazine reported last month that the twosome will stay at Namibia's newest luxury camp, Natural Selection's Hoanib Valley Camp.\n\nHarry and Meghan have spent time together in Africa before. In the couple's first joint interview with BBC News after announcing their engagement last November, Harry revealed he and Meghan went camping together in Botswana early in their courtship, solidifying their relationship.\n\nWhy Meghan Markle Won't Have a Maid of Honor for Her Royal Wedding With Prince Harry\n\n\"We met once and then twice, back-to-back, two dates in London, last July,\" Harry said. \"I think about three, maybe four weeks later, I managed to persuade her to come join me in Botswana and we camped out with each other under the stars. We spent five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. Then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure we had a chance to get to know each other.\"\n\nSee more on the couple in the video below, and keep up with all of ET's coverage of the royal wedding as we count down to May 19.\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry's Royal Wedding: Here's What Time Everything Is Happening", "images": ["http://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_ENT-532x120.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/87b5a38b-kate-middleton.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/brigitte.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/c4f7b18a-f99c-45fb-ab25-fdace0e2171f/1d23ddf0-c1ed-4cf8-9020-6e145c0ff556/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/03/694940094001_5763214500001_5763197623001-vs.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/74ae340b-m4.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/3516a2a4-048c-4661-8c16-be1d4ceb8129/cebd5aa9-fb18-4890-b33b-287379ca27f1/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/evan-ellingson.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/Luke_Evans.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/03/896/500/694940094001_5763214500001_5763197623001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/03/694940094001_5763214500001_5763197623001-vs.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-are-reportedly-postponing-their-royal-honeymoon", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly postponing their royal honeymoon", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "description": "Meghan Markle\u00a0and\u00a0Prince Harry\u00a0will be staying in town after their\u00a0May 19 wedding.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly postponing their royal honeymoon", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:63cc366a-6357-58e6-9249-248de2d21f9d", "dc.source": "ET Online", "dc.date": "2018-05-05", "dcterms.created": "2018-05-05T09:04:05-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2018-05-05T12:27:03-04:00", "og": {"title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly postponing their royal honeymoon", "description": "Meghan Markle\u00a0and\u00a0Prince Harry\u00a0will be staying in town after their\u00a0May 19 wedding.", "type": "article", "image": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/03/694940094001_5763214500001_5763197623001-vs.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-are-reportedly-postponing-their-royal-honeymoon", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly postponing their royal honeymoon", "description": "Meghan Markle\u00a0and\u00a0Prince Harry\u00a0will be staying in town after their\u00a0May 19 wedding.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/03/1024/512/694940094001_5763214500001_5763197623001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-are-reportedly-postponing-their-royal-honeymoon"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/CELEBRITY NEWS/Meghan Markle,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/EVENTS/Royal Wedding", "classification-isa": "meghan-markle,entertainment,royal-wedding", "classification-tags": "meghan-markle,royal-wedding"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525467600.0, "source": "http://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
