Someone who knows the couple described them as \u201cover the moon\u201d to the New York Post. Now, while we\u2019d usually gloss over that line as standard PR-speak, we can\u2019t help but wonder whether the source was hinting at the location of Olivia Land \u2014 a magical and practical place Wilde described to Vulture in October. In Olivia Land, prostitution is legal, \u201cthe streets are paved with dark chocolate,\u201d and \u201cpeople are free of body hair and menstrual cramps.\u201d Sounds like the ideal place for a lasting marriage! On the other hand, Olivian law limits relationships to \u201cseven years, without an option to renew.\u201d So, maybe just the ideal place for a nice marriage?", "images": ["https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5f4/5db/7163f6afeee122ae3b94145677c76ea2c6-22-oliviawilde.rvertical.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/7a4/a30/75f8858697b92dcf7d2fa4305d2ab756ff-succession-with-eyes-open.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.png", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e75/055/c0d568146f8824ed7a619cd514fca1aeb6-airbnb-alt-01.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b3d/336/bc7bcc6907915cf93226c8212d877b2c3e-cynthia-nixon.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2e2/98e/99818d3d7a6a16d9c4b41dca7a9760ec10-2423Cov-4x5-CONFLICT.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5f4/5db/7163f6afeee122ae3b94145677c76ea2c6-22-oliviawilde.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5f4/5db/7163f6afeee122ae3b94145677c76ea2c6-22-oliviawilde.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caroline Bankoff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2013/01/wilde-and-sudeikis-are-getting-married.html", "title": "Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis Are Getting Married", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "celeb weddings, movies, olivia wilde, jason sudeikis, featuretype:feature", "og": {"title": "Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis Are Getting Married", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2013/01/wilde-and-sudeikis-are-getting-married.html", "description": "Whether or not the wedding will be in Olivia Land is unclear.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5f4/5db/7163f6afeee122ae3b94145677c76ea2c6-22-oliviawilde.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis Are Getting Married", "description": "Whether or not the wedding will be in Olivia Land is unclear.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5f4/5db/7163f6afeee122ae3b94145677c76ea2c6-22-oliviawilde.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "description": "Whether or not the wedding will be in Olivia Land is unclear.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "article": {"tag": "celeb weddings, movies, olivia wilde, jason sudeikis", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "sailthru.tags": "celeb weddings, movies, olivia wilde, jason sudeikis", "author": "Caroline Bankoff", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "sectionOverride": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.vulture.com/media/sites/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
