(Khlo\u00e9, 33, and Thompson, 27, welcomed their first child together, daughter True, on April 12 \u2014 just two days after allegations surfaced that he cheated on her throughout her pregnancy.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to give too much away, because we genuinely had those conversations and sometimes we were filming and sometimes we weren\u2019t,\u201d said Kim, 37. \u201cIt was more maybe when Khlo\u00e9 wanted her privacy and no cameras when she was in Cleveland going through that, [but] the sisters were still all filming and talking [about] how to approach it and what to do.\u201d\n\nKim admitted the situation was a first for the famous family.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely new territory for us when you have a new baby coming into the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI think ultimately, we always want her to be happy, but it gets all clouded when there\u2019s a baby, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer motherly instincts kicked in and she has to do what makes her happy,\u201d she added of Khlo\u00e9 standing by Thompson. \u201cSo we\u2019ll support that.\u201d\n\nReflecting on Khlo\u00e9 going into labor in Cleveland while the rest of the family was in Los Angeles, Kim said her sister wanted to keep the news under wraps.\n\n\u201c[Khlo\u00e9] didn\u2019t want anyone to know she was in labor so my mom just left and got on a plane,\u201d said Kim. \u201cThen me and my other sisters get on another plane and we were like, \u2018This is so stupid, we all need to be together and go through this!\u2019 And it was so much drama getting there. You\u2019ll see it all \u2014 season 15. \u2026 This season, honestly, it\u2019s one of our best. It\u2019s so crazy. And I\u2019ve seen crazy.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kris Jenner Struggles Not to Cry as She Talks About Khlo\u00e9 Giving Birth During Cheating Scandal\n\nKim has been most outspoken member of the family about the cheating scandal, previously calling it \u201cso f\u2014ed up,\u201d which resulted in Thompson blocking her on Instagram. They\u2019ve since smoothed things over, and Thompson officially unblocked her after she playfully teased him about it while they were celebrating Khlo\u00e9\u2019s birthday together in June.\n\nThough Khlo\u00e9\u2019s decision to reconcile with Thompson initially didn\u2019t go over well with her famous family, a source told PEOPLE at the time that they \u201crespect her decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone knows Khlo\u00e9 plans on staying with Tristan, so things have been civil so far,\u201d said the source. \u201cThey still have opinions about Tristan\u2019s bad behavior, of course, but no one wants to upset Khlo\u00e9.\u201d\n\nLast week, another source told PEOPLE that it\u2019s been a \u201ctough learning lesson\u201d for Thompson.\n\n\u201cThe whole family had to deal with the public\u2019s perception of him and his relationship with Khlo\u00e9 changing dramatically,\u201d said the source. \u201cHe also doesn\u2019t fully \u2018get\u2019 that she\u2019s been through this before [with ex-husband Lamar Odom], except that this time there\u2019s a child involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he got with Khlo\u00e9, he tried to adapt to the best of his ability but he struggled with being part of such a high-profile family and crossed lines he shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d added the source. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t expecting such major backlash from the public and it\u2019s been a lot for him to handle.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the source said everyone just wants the best for the couple and their baby girl.\n\n\u201cThe whole family is there to support both him and Khlo\u00e9 through everything,\u201d said the source. \u201cBut they also need his commitment in order for the relationship to succeed. All of them are really hoping for a positive outcome for Khlo\u00e9\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nSeason 15 of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on E!", "images":
