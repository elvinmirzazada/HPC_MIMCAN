Taylor Swift sent fans into a frenzy when opening up about the meaning of her new album, Reputation, and how she found love again.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Couples and How They First Met: Love Story Beginnings Star-crossed lovers! Ever wonder how celebrity couples like Brangelina, Tom and Gisele, and the Beckhams first met? Whether it was through mutual friends or at work, check out their love story beginnings here!\n\n\u201c[I] think there was a bit of a bait-and-switch that happened with this album when we put out \u2018Look What You Made Me Do\u2019 and we\u2019re like, \u2018Guys, this album is gonna be one thing.\u2019 And then the album came out,\u201d Swift, 28, told fans at her intimate Taylor Swift NOW concert hosted by AT&T in Chicago on Wednesday, August 29, according to Entertainment Tonight. \u201cIt\u2019s legitimately an album about finding love throughout all the noise.\u201d\n\nThe Grammy winner elaborated on her remarks, seemingly referencing her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn. \u201cI starts with the noise and how that makes all you feel and how it makes you feel when people are saying things about you that you feel, like, aren\u2019t true and living your sort of life in defiance of that. And then, sort of, in the middle of the album you kind of realize, \u2018How much do I really value that?\u2019 she explained. \u201cIf you can find something real in spite of a bad reputation, then isn\u2019t that what matters the most to you? And doesn\u2019t it matter the most to you that you know who your real friends are now?\u201d\n\nRelated: Taylor Swift\u2019s High-Profile Flames While she's recently taken a self-proclaimed hiatus from men, the 1989 songstress has been linked to a slew of hotties over the years.
