This past Father\u2019s Day especially got her thinking about the future, as Alex\u2019s sweet relationship with his daughters made a major impact on her. Jennifer herself has 10-year-old twins Emme and Max, while Alex is the proud father of daughters Ella, 10, and Natasha, 13. And not only does Jennifer love Alex as a partner, she adores seeing him with the kids.\n\n\u201cJen and Alex are the real thing. They have found a love for each other that is very strong and very amazing for them both,\u201d a source close to Jennifer shared with HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cDuring Father\u2019s Day she saw a certain side of Alex that impressed her, and seeing all along the father that Alex is has her thinking about maybe trying for one more with Alex.\u201d How sweet is that? At the same time though, Jennifer loves what she and the former MLB player currently have. For her, it\u2019s all about taking things one step at a time.\n\n\u201cAfter a little more thinking, she\u2019s realizing what they have together already is great, and she would be just as happy with the family she has now,\u201d our insider explained. \u201cShe is actually mostly looking forward to making Alex her future husband instead of her future baby daddy. That is her priority moving forward.\u201d So despite the singer\u2019s current bout of baby fever, it seems the two are not focused on growing their family at the moment. First things first, and J.Lo has her heart set on walking down that aisle!\n\nJennifer paid tribute to her man on Father\u2019s Day, June 17, via Instagram with a heartfelt message accompanied by a video of Alex opening gifts. \u201cAppreciating you and loving you today and everyday for being our fearless leader, our everyday hero, for making us all laugh and enjoy this adventure we are all on together in every moment\u2026\u201d Jen wrote. \u201cFor being the ringmaster to this traveling circus we call our life!! We love you today and everyday\u2026 Happy Fathers Day to the most loving daddy to Tashi and Ella!! And thank you my love for being so beautifully loving to Emme and Max. Your kindness and generosity is never taken for granted. We are all so lucky to have you in our lives\u2026\u201d", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Jennifer-Lopez-Alex-Rodriguez-meeting-pencil-skirt-mega.jpg?quality=100&w=293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jennifer-lopez-50-completely-slays-in-plunging-white-top-after-being-confirmed-as-super-bowl-perfomer-gal.jpg?quality=100&w=275", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/J.lo-and-a-rod.jpg?quality=100&w=248", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jennifer-lopez-alex-rod-baby-fever-ftr.jpg?quality=100&w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jennifer-lopez-alex-rod-baby-fever-ftr.jpg?quality=100"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jennifer-lopez-alex-rod-baby-fever-ftr.jpg?quality=100", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/19/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-want-kids-baby-family-fathers-day/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Getting Baby Fever With Alex Rodriguez After \u2018Amazing\u2019 Father\u2019s Day", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Jennifer Lopez &amp; Alex Rodriguez are more in love than ever, and after a perfect Father's Day, J.Lo has babies on the brain!
