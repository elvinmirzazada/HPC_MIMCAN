West had mentioned the sunken place in previous tweets this week, writing that he was producing music from there.\n\n\n\nTwitter/@kanyewest\n\nKim Kardashian retweeted the initial post calling her hubby out on publishing pics of their home, which they\u2019ve agreed was off limits. The mogul made light of the photos and asked if this means her hit show, \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians,\u201d could start filming there. Kanye and Kim are notorious for keeping their private residence away from cameras, making shooting a reality show of Kim\u2019s life a smidge more difficult.\n\n\n\nTwitter/@kimkardashian\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Kim has thrown herself into the recent flurry of tweets coming from Kanye. Last week after he said he wanted to get rid of everything, she jokingly responded asking if that meant her too. Chrissy Teigen came to her defense and hilarity ensued.\n\nHowever, many people in Kanye\u2019s inner circle say the tweets are part of a larger issue that most certainly isn\u2019t light-hearted or hilarious. As we previously reported, sources close to the rapper say his \u201cerratic\u201d behavior has his team worried about the state of his mental health. In addition to the endless mercurial tweets, we also reported that West parted ways with his manager and members of his legal team. Our story became fodder for more Kanye tweet rants earlier today about the split.\n\nThe Kardashian side is singing a different tune, however. Sources told The Blast that they are steadfast in their belief that the \u201cI Am a God\u201d rapper has \u201cnever been better.\u201d", "images": ["https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2022/11/MEGA812972_014-scaled-e1668168338768.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/previous/611cb9afb0c8b94901c1a692907f1fb2.png", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2021/05/social_share.png", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/11/23052327/MEGA920812_001-scaled-e1700745843267.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/01/Senada_Greca_Kim_Kardashian-e1676138527478.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2021/06/theblast-logo.png", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/05/mega969047_009-scaled-e1683152435875.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/08/28215816/The-Idol-premiere-e1693285111314.jpeg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2022/09/Untitled-design-10.png?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/previous/2892b66dc67a0065ea79fd64df2a42d7.png", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/11/28132341/Tina-Knowles-Beyonce.png?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/01/Johnny-Depp-scaled-e1672684376866.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/previous/1593c9035ca812a70889721aad098f94.jpg?aspect_ratio=13:6&width=1300", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/previous/7ab2d8783c9af197b4fc958aa17e8a65.png", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/08/14114030/tiffany-haddish-resize-e1692038599412.jpeg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/05/mega981411_001-e1684334124511.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2022/05/MEGA382176_004-scaled-e1651600815845.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/previous/541e959b628c11724d140c1a97150f9f.png", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2022/11/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West-Divorce-Settlement-scaled-e1667934962539.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2023/03/mega865716_007-scaled-e1678464032398.jpg?aspect_ratio=390:219&width=390", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2022/12/mega885475_001-scaled-e1672376309224.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180"], "top_img": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2021/05/social_share.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/54669/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-tweets/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Jumps into Kanye West Twitter Storm with \u2018KUWTK\u2019 Joke", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian Jumps into Kanye West Twitter Storm with 'KUWTK' Joke", "description": "Kanye West triumphantly returned to Twitter with a barrage of wild tweets and for the second time, his wife Kim Kardashian is jumping in to mitigate.
