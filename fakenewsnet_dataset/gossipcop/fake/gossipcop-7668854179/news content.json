Her fans responded on Twitter and Instagram, but they seemed to be paying more attention to arguing whether Rihanna was pregnant or just thick than to her musical success, as the Inquisitr reported. While social media was debating Rihanna\u2019s rumored baby bump, the songstress was celebrating at 1Oak Nightclub in New York City with her rumored billionaire beau, Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel, according to People.\n\nHassan and Rihanna kept the party going until after 3 a.m. at the club. The 29-year-old singer stunned in her third outfit of the evening, glittering in a gold crop top and gold jewelry. Rihanna received her award at the Grammys for Best Rap/Sung Performance for her collaboration with Kendrick Lamar.\n\nAlthough the songstress was immersed in celebrating with Jameel after the Grammys, she also reportedly became aware of the rumors soaring on Twitter and Instagram about her alleged pregnancy. An insider told Hollywood Life that Rihanna had an unexpected reaction to the reports that she was sporting a baby bump rather than flaunting thicker curves during her Grammy Awards performance. And part of the songstress\u2019 reported reaction involved her beau.\n\nThe pregnancy speculation began after Rihanna flaunted her curvy body as she danced during her \u201cWild Thoughts\u201d performance at the Grammys. The songstress didn\u2019t try to hide her thicker figure, according to the source, but she reportedly didn\u2019t anticipate that she would face baby rumors.\n\n\u201cSome fans jumped to the conclusion that the 29-year-old was pregnant after her tight costume showed a little belly bump.\u201d\n\nRather than go public with denial of a baby bump, Rihanna is just laughing off the pregnancy claims and trying to ignore them, said the insider. She reportedly is not pregnant and not even trying to have a baby.\n\nRihanna Happy With Thick Curves, Talks Hassan As Baby Daddy\n\nThe source also revealed how Rihanna and her boyfriend feel about her thicker curves.\n\n\u201cRihanna\u2019s been happy with her thicker look, and her billionaire boyfriend Hassan Jameel loves her curves.\u201d\n\nIn addition to trying to laugh off and ignore the pregnancy rumors, however, Rihanna reportedly brought Jameel into the baby bump discussion. According to the insider, the songstress revealed that she does want children and believes that Hassan will be a fabulous father. Rihanna isn\u2019t ready right now to have children, but she reportedly is eager to welcome one or more babies into her life with her beau.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s simply not ready to start a family\u2026 just yet,\u201d clarified the insider.\n\nRihanna Caught Canoodling With Jameel\n\nThe source revealed that Rihanna thinks Jameel is the perfect partner for having children together, describing him as \u201ckind and patient, and a loving person.\u201d And while Rihanna anticipates that Hassan will become a terrific daddy to her children, the insider said that the songstress will be a great mother.\n\n\u201cRihanna loves children\u2026 She\u2019s a natural mom, and she thinks Hassan will make an amazing father.\u201d\n\nFor now, however, Rihanna reportedly is focused on her career rather than starting a family. The insider revealed that Rihanna hasn\u2019t even met her future baby daddy\u2019s family yet, and fans should be aware in the future that when they see her belly protruding, it\u2019s probably a \u201cfood baby\u201d rather than a pregnancy.\n\nRihanna and Jameel have been a couple since June. They were seen kissing in Spain during her vacation, dining at a restaurant in London in September, and visiting Boston in October. For Halloween, Rihanna and Jameel enjoyed dinner, bowling, and \u201ccanoodling all night,\u201d an insider told People.\n\nAn heir to the Abdul Latif Jameel business dynasty of Saudi Arabia, which has the right to sell Toyota Motor vehicles in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries, Hassan works as the head of a charitable group in the company, Community Jameel. Rumors soared last month that Rihanna and Jameel were engaged when she was seen wearing an enormous diamond. But an insider told People that the couple is not yet engaged.", "images": ["https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/inquisitr_cross.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v3/assets/search-icon.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joanne Eglash"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4761834/rihanna-shockingly-reacts-to-pregnancy-claims-by-involving-future-baby-daddy-hassan-jameel-rumors", "title": "Rihanna Shockingly Reacts To Pregnancy Claims By Involving Future Baby Daddy Hassan Jameel [Rumors]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Rihanna had a 2018 Grammy Awards night to remember, from a performance that drew cheers from the audience to an award.
