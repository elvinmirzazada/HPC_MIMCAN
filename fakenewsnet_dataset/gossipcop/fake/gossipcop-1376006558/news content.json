Drake however, is calling BS.\n\nSophie Brussaux has already hired a big NYC lawyer, Raoul Felder, to get the paternity/child support ball rolling. She claims she's 3 1/2 months pregnant and pins down conception to either January 20 or 21. The pic was taken January 24 at a Japanese restaurant in Amsterdam.\n\nThe woman, a retired porn star, has what she says are text messages between her and Drake, which purport to say the following:\n\nDrake: I want you to have an abortion.\n\nBrussaux: I can't kill my baby simply to indulge you sorry.\n\nDrake: Indulge me? F*** you.\n\nBrussaux: What?\n\nDrake: You do know what you're doing you think you're going to get money.\n\nShe says she's having a girl.\n\nWe reached out to Drake's people, who say, \"This woman has a very questionable background. She has admitted to having multiple relationships. We understand she may have problems getting into the United States. She's one of many women claiming he got them pregnant.\"\n\nThe rep goes on, \"If it is in fact Drake's child, which he does not believe, he would do the right thing by the child.\"\n\nThe rep says he has no idea whether the purported text message is even real or out of context because they haven't seen the actual text.\n\nThe rep says Brussaux had sex with another big rapper at the same time as Drake, adding the other rapper has all but acknowledged it's his kid.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/85/4by3/2023/11/28/85299c59a419494c866f9d7f7afaaca7_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/aa/4by3/2023/11/28/aaf21212f28d46209aaa8ec790f835a7_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/39/4by3/2023/11/28/390b233d1e924975a1e5a1f05a29953b_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/33/4by3/2023/11/28/33a341607d6a41e1ae52ed39af932768_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/45/16by9/2023/11/28/45438662648f46ffbfebf301a40f4f09_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/14/4by3/2023/11/28/1482c046cfc04610b0546e0ba5ea8b4d_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/74/o/2017/05/03/74e8938d302c5381ab550a211a22befb_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/6c/4by3/2023/11/29/6c2a3b45ec684d769dadf8c117d2a7ea_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/29/16by9/2023/11/28/29d403855ca4449eb50fcdb7cbba6f62_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/db/4by3/2023/11/28/dba399b3df2b4e4abc5bab424843dbfc_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/7e/16by9/2023/11/28/7e6829b0675f491bb105dc457c107fad_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/56/4by3/2023/11/28/5685edfc344b4d12a042649930d0c439_md.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/dc/4by3/2023/11/28/dc35f957aad2483d8360ab6d7fed6fb4_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/45/4by3/2023/11/28/45438662648f46ffbfebf301a40f4f09_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/df/4by3/2023/11/28/df695469b843407f99a6969bf331d35a_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/fc/4by3/2023/11/06/fc495e2b7c124f7096078a54da4d554f_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/de/4by3/2023/11/28/de840a574ccd433ebb7cfabbde8bfcc0_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/98/4by3/2023/11/28/981c338dfd4d4f1480713af0d99594d7_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/1f/16by9/2023/11/28/1fe1f731eb2b43349563899cebf6693d_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/39/16by9/2023/11/28/390b233d1e924975a1e5a1f05a29953b_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/61/16by9/2017/05/03/61e66361a13d57b59f877ae71015b1b2_xl.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/02/4by3/2023/11/28/029b12ad1e5d41948f96a752511057c1_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/67/o/2017/05/03/672f90c3806b520ca4047801de4346f8_md.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/61/16by9/2017/05/03/61e66361a13d57b59f877ae71015b1b2_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2017/05/03/drake-porn-star-pregnant/", "title": "Drake Gets Former Porn Star Pregnant and She Has Text Messages ...
