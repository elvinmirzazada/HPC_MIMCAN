In 2015, he told The Real of his season 13 partner, soccer star Hope Solo, \u201cThat\u2019s literally the only person that I could dislike from my past, present or future.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Chmerkovskiy and Olympic skater Meryl Davis, who won season 18, brought out the best in each other.\n\n\u201cI feel that I can really be myself with Maks,\u201d she told PEOPLE in 2014. \u201cHe pushes me to stand up for myself, whether it\u2019s in real life or on the dance floor. It\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\nHe added at the time, \u201cShe lets me be creative. I\u2019ve already done more on this season than I\u2019ve done on Dancing with the Stars in 13 seasons.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy Welcome Son Shai Aleksander\n\nAndrews, now 39, has also raved about her experience working with the new dad on season 10. \u201c\u201cThe reason why Maks and I worked out so well was because I come from a world where all I worked with was men, and pretty much I\u2019m like a guy in a lot of ways,\u201d the ESPN personality told PEOPLE in 2015.\n\nWhen it comes to Lachey, though, the insider says last week could\u2019ve been her last performance with Chmerkovskiy: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Maks doesn\u2019t return as her partner for the rest of the season.\u201d\n\nHowever, a DWTS rep says Chmerkovskiy will compete next week.\n\nDancing with the Stars airs Mondays on ABC at 8 p.m. ET.", "images":
