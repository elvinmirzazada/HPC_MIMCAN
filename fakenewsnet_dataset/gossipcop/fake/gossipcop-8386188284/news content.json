Kelley and will be based, in part, on a story by Liane Moriarty. Andrea Arnold has signed on to direct all seven installments, stepping in for Season 1 director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e.\n\nIn addition to Kelly, Arnold, Witherspoon and Kidman, executive producers on the series also include Bruna Papandrea, Vall\u00e9e, Nathan Ross and Gregg Fienberg.\n\nThe first season was a breakout hit for HBO, bringing the premium cable network 16 Emmy nominations and eight wins, effectively sweeping the Limited Series categories in September. The drama also proved to be a big winner at the Golden Globes, taking home four wins, including a supporting actress award for Laura Dern.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Reid-Nakamura.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Reid-Nakamura.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/big-little-lies.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Celebrity-Jeopardy-e1701107404358.png?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Tribeca-Timothy-Olyphant.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/big-little-lies.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ryan-oconnell-diablo-cody.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jane-Lynch-e1701123148569.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/big-little-lies.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reid Nakamura", "Sharon Knolle", "Loree Seitz", "Lucas Manfredi", "Tv Reporter", "Reid.Nakamura Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/big-little-lies-season-2-adds-three-new-cast-members/", "title": "\u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 Season 2 Returns 4 More Cast Members, Adds 2 New Ones", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Big Little Lies' Season 2 Returns 4 More Cast Members, Adds 2 New Ones - TheWrap", "description": "Kathryn Newton, Robin Weigert and Merrin Dungey also confirmed to return", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/big-little-lies-season-2-adds-three-new-cast-members/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/big-little-lies.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-04-03T19:45:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-03T19:51:56+00:00"}, "author": "Reid Nakamura", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Reid Nakamura", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "\u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 Season 2 Returns 4 More Cast Members, Adds 2 New Ones", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/big-little-lies-season-2-adds-three-new-cast-members/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-04-03T12:45:17-07:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Reid Nakamura", "parsely-tags": "big-little-lies, hbo", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522784717.0, "source": "http://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
