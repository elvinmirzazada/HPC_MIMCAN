Good PR is everything, and NeNe\u2019s antics don\u2019t always make that easy.\n\nThoughts on this rumor? Do you think NeNe is a hothead? Does NeNe need to change her ways to keep growing her fortune?\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.\n\nLike AllAboutTRH On Facebook.\n\nFollow the AllAboutTRH Podcast on iTunes & Soundcloud \u2013 Remember to Rate, Comment & Subscribe!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-140x140.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dish-111213-dina-manzo-teresa-giudice.jpg?resize=300%2C168", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/miami.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-logo-lips-small.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-860315656-1014x570.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/watch-what-happens-live-season-15-gallery-15040-04.jpg?resize=300%2C168", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-09-at-11.15.31-AM.png?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nene-leakes.jpg?fit=580%2C326", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-at-4.19.02-PM.png?resize=150%2C150", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nene-leakes.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/https://blog-cdn.feedspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Celebrity-Gossip-100-transparent_216px.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/real-housewives-of-new-york-luann-de-lesseps.jpg?resize=300%2C168", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/all-about-trh-logo.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RHONJ-CAST.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-112x112.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-white.png?w=1320", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/RHONJ.jpg?resize=150%2C150"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nene-leakes.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lara Sophia"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180309002407/http://www.allabouttrh.com/2018/03/02/nene-leakes-turned-weight-loss-spokesperson/", "title": "Was NeNe Leakes Turned Down As A Weight-Loss Spokesperson? - The Real Housewives", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Was NeNe Leakes Turned Down As A Weight-Loss Spokesperson? - The Real Housewives | News.
