in Miami this weekend.\n\nFollowing a report \u2014 blasted as \u201c100 percent untrue\u201d by Katie Holmes\u2019 rep in a statement to PEOPLE \u2014 that the couple had been planning a wedding and called it off because they split due to \u201ctrust issues,\u201d Foxx, 50, traveled to Miami for the Monster 14th Annual Irie Weekend powered by South Florida Ford.\n\nAll proceeds from the annual fundraising event \u2014 founded by Miami-based DJ Irie \u2014 go towards helping the Irie Foundation provide scholarship opportunities and mentoring programs to at-risk youth living in South Florida.\n\n\u201cOf course he\u2019s aware of the headlines surrounding him and Katie but he doesn\u2019t seem worried about that at all,\u201d a source tells PEOPLE. \u201cHe\u2019s just his happy, hilarious self.\u201d\n\nDylan Rives\n\n\u201cJamie is in town to support his friend Irie and just enjoy a guys\u2019 weekend,\u201d the source explains. \u201cHe never misses this but he\u2019s particularly happy for a little escape this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe got in Friday night and headed straight to Top Golf to meet up with his boys and enjoy the festivities,\u201d the source continues, adding that while there are \u201cwomen around,\u201d Foxx isn\u2019t \u201cflirting much this time around.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe seems just happy to get away and kick back,\u201d the insider remarks.\n\nDuring the fun-filled evening, Foxx and friends joined Ludacris onstage to perform one of the rapper\u2019s biggest hits, \u201cMove Bitch.\u201d\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nThough the Beat Shazam host and Dawson\u2019s Creek star, 39, first being seen dancing with one another in the Hamptons in 2013, have never confirmed their relationship, they\u2019ve been stepping out more often since a photographer captured a rare photo of the pair together, walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach in September.\n\nThey also sat together at Clive Davis\u2019 Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, played basketball together on Valentine\u2019s Day and were seen leaving Nobu restaurant in New York City on April 22, followed by Carbone on May 1.", "images":
