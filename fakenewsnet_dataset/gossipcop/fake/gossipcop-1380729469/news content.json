Back in the late 1960s, early 1970s. That was back during the time where, you know, drugs were going to expand our minds and everybody was experimenting and everything. We were really getting high, we didn't know it. And cocaine at that time was considered harmless. You know. I remember magazine articles in People Magazine of doctors saying it is not addicting. It is just\u2014alcohol is worse. So I think we all fell into that. But that's not the way it was.\"\n\nWhen asked if he believed he had ever been addicted to the drugs, Quaid responded, \"It was a gradual thing. But it got to the point where I couldn't have any fun unless I had it.
