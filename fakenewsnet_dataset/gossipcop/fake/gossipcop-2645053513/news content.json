Marvel vs DC: It\u2019s on!\n\nThor Odinson, who also goes by the name of Chris Hemsworth, has \u2018threatened\u2019 not to come on TV host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s show after latter revealed himself for the treacherous person he is, someone who sides with team Batman. Chris Hemsworth also challenged Jimmy Kimmel to find \u201canother Avenger named Chris.\u201d It seems Kimmel, a mortal and surely not a superhero, is stuck in this altercation of superheroes and he had to choose sides. It all started with Ben Affleck, who plays Batman in DC\u2019s film universe, and when he quoted a \u2018news\u2019 report stating that Matt Damon has replaced Ben Affleck with Chris Hemsworth as his new best friend. Is there going to be a battle between the God of Thunder and the Dark Knight?\n\nAffleck said to Hemsworth that he can have Damon, and that he is team Jimmy Kimmel \u2018anyways\u2019. \u201cHey @chrishemsworth, you can have him!
