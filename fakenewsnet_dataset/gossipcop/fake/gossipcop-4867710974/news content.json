I take full responsibility for my absence. And want to apologize to my partner Vanessa. We are both looking forward to dancing for our fans next week!\u201d the father of one wrote.\n\nPEOPLE\u2019s special issue, 25 Seasons of Dancing with the Stars, is on stands now.\n\nOn Monday, Chmerkovskiy\u2019s wife \u2014 and fellow DWTS pro \u2014 Peta Murgatroyd shared with PEOPLE that even though \u201ca lot was made of the fact that Maks missed last week\u2019s show,\u201d only a \u201cfew people know how crazy this show really gets \u2014 not only physically on your body but mentally as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe care about our partners, and that\u2019s what makes it so hard sometime, because you care and love each other, and you want them to do so well. You invest so much time-wise, and you just want them to be the best and get the best results possible at the end of the day on the Monday night. But it is difficult to deal with life, stresses, rehearsals and then show time and everything that goes along with that,\u201d she added.\n\nRob Latour/Variety/REX/Shutterstock\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t the first time Chmerkovskiy has been rumored to clash with his DWTS counterpart \u2014 in 2015 he told The Real that his season 13 partner, soccer star Hope Solo, is \u201cliterally the only person that I could dislike from my past, present or future\u201d \u2014 an insider insisted that he and Lachey are a unified pair.\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Cost of Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Mirrorball Trophy\n\n\u201cMaks and Vanessa are a team and completely support each other 100 percent,\u201d the insider told PEOPLE. \u201cThey are so friendly backstage and are great to work with. You can tell they are genuinely enjoying themselves and are here to have a good time.\u201d\n\nDancing with the Stars airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/HnUwhYg1bOy4RC5x2a3JZsJJrvQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Peta-Murgatroyd-and-Maks-Chmerkovskiy-Reveal-the-Sex-of-Baby-042723-2-e1cbdf71181d4e61bce5ed684e307016.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/5lq1O6U8YBl6QteEUOd44H2OwI4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/carrie-ann-inaba-len-goodman-bruno-tonioli-dancing-with-the-stars-042423-5-d4f8266f16a84c89bfb58f320fd58a75.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hjRyvC-wJcbJGVQfYTZfd-HhO0E=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/len-goodman-dancing-with-the-stars-042423-1-ebe6406ef0d74da2a31e62fce6ae6ea5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rrri3fwO5YWSy938H3zXH2z7ow4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(599x0:601x2)/lindsay-arnold-baby-050423-tout-677ec0e2b962424a95754b790a8c13ff.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/vf8X-nz_sn_KJvuOPvqUOjMx32Y=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x149:751x151)/Cheryl-Burke-26-seasons-02-111822-8f403b5f489247a69242c040936feff0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/RAZjEEo10Vc2wv_d9ca01I2BlbQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x318:1001x320)/mark-ballas-annouces-dwts-retirement-031323-7638b1612afe47f0b16420bf6f8d461f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/OWux4FnhbZRAJoYDMSHH6H6DaHY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(743x0:745x2)/dwts1-1-19fdd0abed4943cc825744fec0c1b1d9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7n5NXJexs0r5i_IZJ92BwtqOBGg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x289:751x291)/Peta-Murgatroyd-Maks-Chmerkovskiy-2a68109c514c42e49bc9030467b19496.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/he2Y1gK6k5jykouHLYnYxq7widQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1099x172:1101x174)/Maksim-Chmerkovskiy-and-Valentin-Chmerkovskiy-Napa-Valley-030623-03-8f6f0f0699b9482eb858e2b348d7f40a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/07Wiwmj_SUoXe3rZI0pRynyMspU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x9:736x11)/Maks-and-Val-chmerkovskiy-Rave-About-Wives-Peta-and-Jenna-Ahead-of-Mothers-Day-050123-1-a7754d0bbe1144719e38d16eeb010c80.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/iywp4UIw11EzS4OilpSPGKj0uuI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/PetaMurgatroydMaternity06072023-73-3aaf57004dde4a47ba24c1deb14cd80e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/SHozjlT7IcCT6oirJX-FFSVolcw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/peta-murgatroyd-rihanna-022723-1-ef3d8ecede944587b504aaf7f6b2ebc6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/5rrzCNQnZ5xOPnQTfsyOOglNnhk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Maks-Chmerkovskiy-and-Peta-Murgatroyd-06212369-e258ec05f8224d2b8ea84a4922bf1e60.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Y13U6vXd4gKen7FBPeptU87Jmh0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(680x0:682x2)/maksim-chmerkovskiy-445247d413f842738997fab3a813e033.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/57VbHYdNJ5kHVZ9skp2M4P9V29k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(344x399:346x401)/Maksim-Chmerkovskiy-Instagram-01-040623-0625da429aae4f17a9a687033cae5d23.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/XBLIr_i3I5vP4Jcsy9RLjLaKIrM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(619x379:621x381)/val-chmerkovskiy-jenna-johnson-cinderella-red-carpet-071422-2000-1258a35725174541a1aa89193150d321.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/WxaAta4n8lcwdJM4RwqMZI9avjk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(682x0:684x2)/dwts-season-25-13-1-2000-2c9ad80a697c46d6a291122ff4d1289c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KvVnGOi1LluGfNeJz659v6MTQyY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1109x349:1111x351)/Maksim-Chmerkovsiky-Sherri-Shepherd-01-030223-9aa2456e816e40e3b478abe8b7403b11.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/WxaAta4n8lcwdJM4RwqMZI9avjk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(682x0:684x2)/dwts-season-25-13-1-2000-2c9ad80a697c46d6a291122ff4d1289c.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Staff Editor For Human Interest S Digital Vertical At People.
