{"url": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Jenner", "text": "American media personality, socialite, and businesswoman\n\nKristen Mary Jenner (n\u00e9e Houghton HOH-t\u0259n, formerly Kardashian; born November 5, 1955) is an American media personality, socialite, and businesswoman. She rose to fame starring in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians (2007\u20132021) with her family. The success of their show led her and her family to star in multiple spin-off series, including Kourtney and Khloe Take Miami (2009), Kourtney and Kim Take New York (2011), Khloe & Lamar (2011), Rob & Chyna (2016) and Life of Kylie (2017). She acted as executive producer for most of her family's reality programs. In 2013, she hosted a six week long pop culture-driven daytime talk show, called Kris. Following her family's decision to sign off from E! in 2021, they then went on to star in The Kardashians on Hulu from 2022.\n\nShe has four children from her first marriage to lawyer Robert Kardashian: Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9 and Robert, and two children from her second marriage to television personality and retired Olympic Games medalist Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn): Kendall and Kylie. From all of her children, she has 12 grandchildren.\n\nEarly life\n\nJenner was born in San Diego, California, on November 5, 1955, the elder of two children born to Mary Jo \"M. J.\" Shannon (n\u00e9e Campbell; born 1934), who owned a children's clothing store, and Robert True \"Bob\" Houghton (1931\u20131975), an engineer.[1][2][3][4] When she was seven years old, M. J. and Bob divorced, and she and her younger sister, Karen Casey (n\u00e9e Houghton; born 1958), were raised by their mother. M. J. would eventually remarry, to businessman Harry Shannon (1926\u20132003), who helped raise Jenner and her sister. By her mother's marriage to Harry, she gained a half-brother, Steven \"Steve\" Shannon.[5]\n\nThree months after moving to Oxnard, California, Shannon's business partner allegedly left with all the company's capital, so the family moved back to San Diego.[6] In San Diego, Jenner worked at Shannon & Company, a children's clothing store that belonged to her mother.[7] Jenner attended Clairemont High School[8] and graduated in 1973.[9] In 1975, when Jenner was 19, her biological father died in a car crash.[10] She worked for American Airlines as a flight attendant for a year in 1976.[11]\n\nCareer\n\nTelevision\n\nJenner met with Ryan Seacrest in 2007 to pursue a reality television show based on her family. Seacrest, who had his own production company, decided to develop the idea, having the popular family-based show The Osbournes in his mind. Jenner further commented on the possible series:[12]\n\nLike, there's the little girls, and there's the older girls, and then there's my son. [...] Everybody thinks that they could create a bunch of drama in their lives, but it's something that I felt I didn't even have to think about. It would be natural.\n\nThe show eventually was picked up to air on the E! cable network, with Jenner acting as the executive producer. The series focused on the personal and professional lives of the Kardashian\u2013Jenner blended families.[13] The series debuted on October 14, 2007 and became one of the longest-running reality television shows in the country.[14]\n\nThe series was successful for its network, E!, and has resulted in the creation of numerous spin-offs[15] including Kourtney and Kim Take Miami (2009), in which Jenner has made multiple guest appearances.[16] Jenner was also featured as a recurring cast member in Kourtney and Kim Take New York, which premiered in January 2011. Also in 2011, Jenner made an appearance in her daughter's show, Khloe & Lamar when it debuted, and the series focused on Khloe Kardashian and her then husband Lamar Odam's personal life and relationship.[17] On March 26, 2014, E! announced a Keeping Up with the Kardashians spin-off series titled Kourtney & Khlo\u00e9 Take the Hamptons. The Hamptons follows Kourtney, Khlo\u00e9, and Scott Disick as they relocate to The Hamptons while the girls work on the New York Dash store plus open a pop-up store.[18] The show also featured their family including Jenner.

The show's six-week trial run was not extended.[23]\n\nIn 2015, Jenner appeared as a recurring cast member in six episodes of the E! reality series I Am Cait. The show followed the journey of her ex husband Caitlyn Jenner's (formerly Bruce) gender transition.[24][25][26] Even after their 2015 divorce, they continued to co-star on Keeping Up with the Kardashians together with their children.\n\nIn 2021, Jenner and her family announced that their reality show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, would be ending after twenty seasons and almost 15 years on air.[27][28][29] The final (twentieth) season premiered on March 18, 2021.[30][31]\n\nIn April 2022, Jenner and her family returned to the television screens with their brand new reality television show, titled The Kardashians, after they left the E!
