The \u201cAll I Have\u201d singer took the stage for her Las Vegas, Nevada residency on Wednesday, May 24, and threw a little shade in the middle of her performance. One fan was filming when Jennifer was dancing around the stage with her backup dancers behind her. Suddenly the music slows down and plays what sounds EXACTLY like Drake\u2019s \u201cHotline Bling,\u201d and J.Lo stops dead in her tracks. She puts her hand on her hip an stares at the audience, then tells them: \u201cHuh. Booty call.\u201d The crowd roars as Jennifer\u2019s own music kicks back in, and she continues dancing like the moment never happened. Incredible!\n\nSo, is this a diss? Is this just Jennifer\u2019s way of telling her fans what was really going on for those months she was linked to Drake? Or is she just being a little sassy on stage for fun? Well, a source close to JLo explains that, \u201cthe \u201cbooty call\u201d line has been in the show since opening night and is actually just used to set her up to sing her next song.\u201d Despite what\u2019s up with Jennifer and Drake these days, she\u2019s happily in love with her new man, Alex Rodriguez, 41. J.Lo and A-Rod are going so strong, he\u2019s even been visiting her on the set of her show, Shades of Blue, which films in their hometown of New York City. Meanwhile Drake was fawning over every woman in existence at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards on Sunday, May 21, including Vanessa Hudgens, Nicki Minaj and even Kate Beckinsale! Too funny.\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 What do YOU think about J.Lo calling Drake a \u201cbooty call\u201d in concert?
