TMZ also reported that the duo grabbed dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills on Monday.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, Jenner and Simmons were spotted hitting up the Nice Guy in West Hollywood on Wednesday night. Though they arrived separately and exited through different doors, they left in the same SUV at the end of the night, according to video obtained by TMZ.\n\nThe Blast published a video of the couple entering the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Beverly Hills together around 2 a.m.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about Jenner\u2019s rumored beau.\n\nGetty (2)\n\nHe\u2019s Up for the NBA\u2019s Top Rookie Prize\n\nFollowing a successful stint playing college basketball for Louisiana State University, Simmons became the NBA\u2019s number one draft pick in 2016, signing a contract to play with the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nAlthough Simmons ended up sitting out the 2016-2017 season after injuring his ankle during training, he made his NBA debut in October 2017.

The winner will be announced later this month.\n\nSimmons is also signed to LeBron James\u2018 management company, Klutch Sports Group, alongside Tristan Thompson, who is currently dating and shares a child with Jenner\u2019s sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?
