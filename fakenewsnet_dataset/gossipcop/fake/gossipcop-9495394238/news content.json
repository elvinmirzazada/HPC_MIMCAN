Roberts, the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and the 2004 presidential election.[16] CNN president Jonathan Klein later said he regretted not hiring Kelly as a reporter at the beginning of her career, because she was \"the one talent you'd want to have from somewhere else\".[17]\n\n2004\u20132017: Fox News\n\nIn 2004, Kelly applied for a job at Fox News.[16] She contributed legal segments for Special Report with Brit Hume and hosted her own legal segment, Kelly's Court, during Weekend Live.

Or is this real?\"[23][24][25][26]\n\nKelly left America Live in July 2013 and took maternity leave.
