After all, it comes with the territory, considering the word came from the opera world.\n\nBut Celine Dion takes the term to new heights.\n\nShe may look and sound great to her adoring fans in the audience at tonight's Madison Square Garden concert, but it takes a village \u2014 or at least 11 onstage bodyguards \u2014 to keep the Canadian chanteuse happy.\n\nThough Dion rates as a world-class entertainer, what's more entertaining are her lists of demands. Apparently her royal divaness won't take the stage without a supply of Bavarian figs and French cherries in her dressing room.\n\nWhen the Brits heard about this for her London shows, they were up in arms about her not wanting to eat local food \u2014 but hey, it's \u00adEnglish food, so can you blame her?\n\nAccording to the South African newspaper The Times \u2014 which ran a story about her 67-page contract with the concert promoter Kusasa, the organizer of the South African leg of her current tour \u2014 she has some interesting personnel requirements, as well.\n\n\n\nOnstage with her at all times must be those 11 security guards \u2014 eight of whom are to be on chairs that can swivel 30 degrees. (I know there's a lot of kidnapping in South Africa, but that's going a little overboard.)\n\nShe also requires her own physio-therapist and a voice or throat specialist on call from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. But her medical demands go even further: One of Dion's travel accessories is a dentist. Apparently, she had some bad teeth in the 1980s, which led to a nasty nickname, \"Canine Dion,\" so she got her front teeth capped. (I guess all that warbling must loosen them up mighty fast.)\n\nSays VH1 commentator Bex Schwartz: \"Bringing her own dentist with her on tour is actually really nice and compassionate, since studies show that excessive exposure to Celine Dion rots teeth quicker than caramel.\"\n\nRemember her days as a diva-in-residence at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas? We're betting some wardrobe folks sure do. According to Star magazine, she was less than thrilled to see the wardrobe setup for her show \"A New Day.\" When she saw what they had in mind, she said, \u2018Non!' Costumers winged their way in from Hollywood and Canada to produce 10 new ensembles just for her, tout de suite!\n\n\"She's the only diva I know who has four costume changes for breakfast \u2014 and that's just when she's at home!\" says Leon Hall, fashion critic and Zink magazine editor at large.\n\nKidding aside, at home Dion does like to keep on the diva, too. According to the Palm Beach Post, over the past two years at her Jupiter, Fla., residence \u2014 it's one of many \u2014 6.5 million gallons of water were used. Was she trying to re-create the sinking of the Titanic in her backyard?\n\nABC, which did some investi\u00adgation into these waterworks, found that it amounted to \"18,000 gallons of water a day, about 100 times more than the 170 gallons per day the average resident uses, according to the Florida-based U.S. Water Institute.\n\n\n\n\"Dion's annual water usage,\" continued the report, \"could fill more than 10 Olympic-sized swimming pools.\"\n\nKeep in mind that her Florida house is in a region of the country that has been in the middle of a water shortage for years, and the effects of that drought have resulted in an increase in water rates.\n\nThere are divas, and then there are divas, and Dion's divaness has not gone unnoticed by those who know. But if you were once married to one of the biggest \u2014 Mariah Carey \u2014 and you call Celine one, that's saying something. According to Tommy Mottola, Mariah's ex, Celine is the \"ultimate diva.\" That's gotta hurt. (Though let's face it, he probably intended it as a compliment.)\n\nThere's even an infamous \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch lampooning Celine and her out-there behavior. In it, she's the host of her own talk show, with \"guests\" Carey, Gloria Estefan and Shania Twain, all of whom had performed together on VH1's \u2014 what else? \u2014 \"Divas Live\" concert.\n\nOne guess as to which singer outdiva-ed them all in the skit.\n\nFor every Celine watcher, there is a favorite Dion-as-diva moment. For Schwartz, it came during the VH1 \"Divas Las Vegas\" concert (notice a trend here?) when Dion played the hambone (using her thigh as a guitar) while massacring the AC/DC song \"You Shook Me All Night Long.\"\n\nSays Schwartz: \"Only a true diva would dare to play air guitar to AC/DC on her thigh.\"\n\n", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20160714082819im_/http://multimedia.nydailynews.com/css/rh/i/envelope.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160714082819im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2710799.1468478611!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/prick-wall-july-14-2016.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160714082819im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.322936.1314416498!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/amd-celinedion-jpg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160714082819im_/http://multimedia.nydailynews.com/css/rh/i/nydn-logo.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160714082819im_/http://multimedia.nydailynews.com/css/rh/i/rh-app.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160714082819im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.322936.1314416498!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/amd-celinedion-jpg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160714082819im_/http://multimedia.nydailynews.com/css/rh/i/rh-subscribe.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160714082819im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.322936.1314416498!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/amd-celinedion-jpg.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caroline Waxler"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160714082819/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/celine-world-class-prima-dion-na-article-1.322934", "title": "A world-class prima Dion-na", "meta_data": {"nydn_section": "Music & Arts", "fb": {"app_id": 107464888913, "admins": 1594068001, "pages": 268914272540}, "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "title": "A world-class prima Dion-na", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160714082819/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/celine-world-class-prima-dion-na-article-1.322934", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160714082819im_/http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.322936.1314416498!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/amd-celinedion-jpg.jpg", "description": "People almost expect great performers to be divas.
