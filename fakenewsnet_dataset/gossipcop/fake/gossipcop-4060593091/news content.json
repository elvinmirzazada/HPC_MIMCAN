From day one, I have denied the outrageous allegations against me. Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit. I have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one. In this country, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. However, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused. I understand and look forward to clearing my name once and for all. In the meantime, I want to express my gratitude to the cast and crew that I\u2019ve worked so closely with over the past three seasons. I wish them nothing but success. I am also so thankful to the fans that have supported me and continue to do so.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you shocked over the allegations against Danny Masterson?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ashton-kutcher-danny-masterson-firing-ftr.jpg?quality=100", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ashton-kutcher-with-former-stepdaughter-rumer-willis-backgrid-gal.jpg?quality=100&w=293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ashton-kutcher-marathon-splash-gak.jpg?quality=100&w=293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ashton-kutcher-photos-12.jpg?quality=100&w=359", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ashton-kutcher-danny-masterson-firing-ftr.jpg?quality=100&w=384&h=216&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ashton-kutcher-danny-masterson-firing-ftr.jpg?quality=100", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/06/ashton-kutcher-danny-masterson-firing-the-ranch-rape-allegations-netflix/", "title": "Ashton Kutcher Rocked By Danny Masterson Firing: \u2018He\u2019s Trying To Protect The Show\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Ashton Kutcher's is shocked over the sexual misconduct allegations against his friend, Danny Masterson; who has since been fired from Netflix's 'The Ranch,' which Kutcher is a producer on.", "google-site-verification": "-fFtY3InnBG-L4jhda35PWMnefeOSa7tU_YdarFQyIc", "news_keywords": "Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Netflix", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "auto-social": "always", "author": "Jenna Lemoncelli", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ashton Kutcher Rocked By Danny Masterson Firing: \u2018He\u2019s Trying To Protect The Show\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/06/ashton-kutcher-danny-masterson-firing-the-ranch-rape-allegations-netflix/", "description": "Ashton Kutcher\u2019s world has been turned upside down amidst the sexual misconduct allegations against his friend, Danny Masterson.
