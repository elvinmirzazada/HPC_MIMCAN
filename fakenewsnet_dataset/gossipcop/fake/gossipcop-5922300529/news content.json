When she refused ... Karrueche says Chris became aggressive.\n\nKarrueche explained that in text messages between herself and Chris post-breakup, he would say things like \"I'm not being nice to you no more, if I see you out in public again and I'm there I will make you hate me even more, don't be anywhere I'm out in public, I'm going to ban you from all events.\"\n\nShe claims he also texted her more violent threats like ... \"I can get my money back and I'm tired of playing games\" as well as \"Bitch I will beat the s**t out of you\" and \"I promise you I will make your life hell.\" She says he also once wrote \"Imma kill blood\" under a photo of her and actor Michael B. Jordan.\n\nKarrueche also testified that Chris had beaten her before.\n\nChris Brown's attorney, David Gammill, grilled Karrueche on cross-examination, and pressed her on allegedly taunting Chris about the rings by saying she had sold them. Karrueche told Gammill she never planned to return the rings because they were hers. Gammill also brought up the point of Karrueche never reporting any of the alleged behavior to authorities.", "images":
