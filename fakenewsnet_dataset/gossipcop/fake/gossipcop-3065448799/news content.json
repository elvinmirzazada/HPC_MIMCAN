Garner and Affleck also have not \u201ccalled off\u201d their divorce. Gossip Cop can exclusively bust these untruths.\n\nThe latest cover of Star features photos of Garner and Shookus that were taken from side angles, giving the false illusion of protruding stomachs. These misleading pictures are being used to sell an entirely fabricated narrative about Affleck impregnating both women. It\u2019s evident right in the sub-headline inside the issue that this is all bogus, with the magazine writing, \u201cSources Say Ben Affleck May Be Gearing Up For New Babies \u2014 With Both His Girlfriend And His Ex-Wife!\u201d Garner is not Affleck\u2019s \u201cex-wife,\u201d as they are still legally married, and the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d indicates the outlet doesn\u2019t have any legitimate confirmation to back up its claims.\n\nIn fact, the publication goes on to contend Affleck \u201ccould be expecting a child not only with Lindsay \u2014 but also with Jen.\u201d Notably, neither \u201cmay\u201d nor \u201ccould\u201d appear on the cover, where it\u2019s declared Shookus and Garner are \u201cboth pregnant.\u201d The tabloid lures readers in with what appears to be an announcement, but then changes course in the actual story, which is apparently about the possibility that they\u2019re both carrying the actor\u2019s babies. Following this bait-and-switch, a so-called \u201csource\u201d calls the situation a \u201cmess,\u201d but asserts \u201cthe initial shock is wearing off,\u201d and Affleck is \u201cactually feeling good about it.\u201d\n\nBut how is it not known for sure then whether or not Garner and Shookus are expecting? The logic is faulty throughout the piece. It\u2019s alleged that Affleck possibly impregnated Garner when he supposedly spent the night at her home back on March 7. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret Ben was trying to woo Jen back, even while seeing Lindsay,\u201d claims the tabloid\u2019s untraceable \u201cinsider,\u201d while the unnamed \u201csource\u201d theorizes Affleck and Garner \u201cmay have had a brief magic moment\u201d during the unverified \u201csleepover.\u201d Meanwhile, another anonymous \u201cinsider\u201d contends that unidentifiable \u201cpeople\u201d are now \u201cbuzzing she\u2019s pregnant, and that the timing lines perfectly up with the night Ben slept at her place.\u201d\n\nAs for Shookus, the magazine asserts she\u2019s \u201crumored to be pregnant, too,\u201d with another purported \u201csource\u201d alleging there\u2019s \u201ctalk of a baby on the way.\u201d She and Affleck are said to be \u201cboth very happy, in spite of the unusual circumstances,\u201d which is a clear contradiction from the cover line that maintains Shookus\u2019 \u201cbaby joy\u201d has been \u201cshattered.\u201d In another red flag, there\u2019s nothing said in the article about Affleck and Garner calling off their divorce, despite that also being touted on the front of the issue.\n\nGossip Cop also already busted this same outlet a few weeks ago for falsely claiming Shookus is pregnant. As we pointed out then, just days before that tale was published Shookus and Affleck went on a double date with her parents, where she was seen drinking wine. That same weekend, Shookus and Affleck were photographed on a hike with her family, and it was clear from her pictured bared midriff that she does not have any kind of a baby bump. That was on June 24, a week after the misleading June 16 photo of Shookus that Star uses on its cover. Basically, she didn\u2019t have a baby bump and then eight days later it disappeared.\n\nIn regards to the actor reconciling with his estranged wife, People examined the state of Affleck and Garner\u2019s relationship on the one-year anniversary of the divorce filing, and reported that while they co-parent and support one another, he is in a \u201cvery committed relationship\u201d with Shookus. That means no dalliances with Garner. Furthermore, Garner just did a YouTube live stream with Martha Stewart this week, and it\u2019s apparent from the video that she, too, doesn\u2019t have a baby bump. The photo of Garner on the cover was taken on July 4, a full 12 days before her later flat-stomach appearance with Stewart.\n\nConclusion: More recent photos of Garner and Shookus than the ones used by the tabloid show that neither of them has a baby bump. There is also independent reporting about Shookus drinking wine after the cover picture was taken, and another reputable outlet has reported that Garner and Affleck aren\u2019t involved romantically any more. That rules out pregnancies for both women. In addition to all this transparent evidence, Garner\u2019s spokesperson, who is authorized to speak on her behalf, confirms to Gossip Cop that she is neither pregnant nor having a rendezvous with Affleck. For his part, Affleck\u2019s rep tells us on the record that the double pregnancy cover story is \u201cso crazy\u201d and untrue that it\u2019s \u201camusing almost.\u201d And a Shookus confidante, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, calls the claims both \u201chilarious\u201d and \u201cnot true.\u201d", "images": ["http://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/9QSKD2N.jpg?resize=500%2C250", "http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhw_W80hB1qSLjM9coWwH25V0PMCC0d00odVviIAvRkuEGhQqwfqgZluhELFkkutyk4UKOFz9bdv1ag1aeHkXGHPGMrjVuWyf4JO0Ifxy9ox0Xi_gIU6iL3pI-L_4HY2Vd0me6-Uvap1F4zRTt9ke8kH6X6KtiUv-5dTnrCvoqTjjnkZ4fjcvI44L_b=w563-h303", "http://mylifeofcrime.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/morrisg-info.jpg?w=468&h=381", "http://c2.vgtstatic.com/thumbll/1/8/185615-v1/wolfgang-marguerres-house.jpg", "http://www.rssing.com/inc2/img/matult.jpg", "http://www.gfxtra31.com/uploads/posts/2023-11/1701112554_00a54e29_medium.jpg", "http://www.rssing.com/inc2/img/tsbtn.png", "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/files/2012/08/aaagrabin-270x270.jpg", "http://www.rssing.com/inc2/img/star_full.png", "http://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/047/390/cover8.jpg", "http://footballfonts.com/u/img/premier-league-23-24-otf-font-installation.jpg", "http://images.dailykos.com/images/1250449/large/F_NHCuWXgAEwmnf1.jpg?1701005344", "http://i1.wp.com/4.bp.blogspot.com/-JwKOpDHBQAw/VyoOC2mN_zI/AAAAAAAACog/aD8odnlNJTsQj78AzVONN2ep6JRvv3iwACLcB/s1600/Slumdog%2BMillionaire%2B%25282008%2529%2BBluray.jpg?resize=350%2C450&ssl=1", "http://gantdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Haselhuhn-Timothy-6-4-86-265x300.png", "http://www.aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IAM-Logo-300x165.png", "http://audioz.download/uploads/posts/2018-03/thumbs/1521643996_b.jpg", "http://www.rssing.com/favicon.ico", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CUkIv712kCY/VYo5KIYsbmI/AAAAAAAAdBM/3fpj_vqkp_s/s400/Bukan-Wanita-Sempurna-Syawal-Aidilfitri4.jpg", "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-PufEKtYy6uI/Vhf3giItgqI/AAAAAAAACn4/0k5uVgdJA7w/s400/this%2Bis%2Bthe%2Bboyfriend%2Bi%2Bwas%2Btalking%2Babout.jpg", "http://i0.wp.com/publictv.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/U_19TEAM_INDIA.jpg?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1", "http://www.nagpurtoday.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Burglar.png", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KygWsHah2_7Qa.gif", "http://assets.suredone.com/1517/media-pics/cp039028-ac-heater-blower-fan-motor-vw-rabbit-mk1-cabriolet-a-c-genuine-175-820-021-d.jpg", "http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisNetjGqLrNAxN-B6IipvrUWH2xLZPo1mCo7KffSudwRAUC4LRlnByuYonbfEWPG33xVcdkKcpKt9FzOeYg5zFE5vhTp-GoDexEMgOpgO3wUSZoDXOM-IcAUvK3ZnRKi9mIDs2eBN3aW325vaN1sSoCtdt3ubflKyOFzZpkKGWn4kDAf4w4HqsFjLeXUc/w369-h256/ncert-solutions-for-trikonomiti-ka-parichaya-exercise-8-1-class10-maths-hindi-9.JPG", "http://prints.mikeschley.com/img/s6/v135/p2665005923-3.jpg", "http://www.donegaldaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/James-Brennan-228x300.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--H9mby7tAMI/ULbtVcWqzHI/AAAAAAAAACY/ykOJjy2vq0g/s1600/redmananne.jpg", "http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEixPXKhjpTOkx66SzDV9l6eqIaryTKWOnxgVUlZu8JVSLxKQp8QIy19319Z5h8BuM_6LTRiL0GcDDuMJBwBwIQ4sSNIqZ8y5pvWI-C5NylG94h-HgwJ2ArRnRMCaYfCRE2JckbSGgeM58WclMiaRSAQjARH4lA4Nb2lEfpywzdYby7fZLAhcGhz8huDoHM/s16000/Gates-2-678x381.jpg.webp", "http://media.moddb.com/cache/images/downloads/1/93/92326/thumb_620x2000/eeeeeee.jpg", "http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhblK3yuStl8rVLG-OkChVs0ARBO8j5RwEnq7yC5qk-Q9z7G7Hu3mMxT3W-OmmGN-5CIU88YHmHmt3iP_jbd4q51gL1M0c7akLCHW7vJpEihCiWkTBkDaa4S9mAS0ocxfNpqlMNRukGnXrD04z-daOM0kSS-g2AX6FYrxtUQW4VsYeg0LTrWhZQI7_vbcGo/w640-h356/IOR%20Nelson%2010-11-2023%20(2).JPG", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61xAjXtg-tL.jpg", "http://cdn.singpromos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Public-Transport-Career-feat-singpromos.com-20-Nov-2023-550x289.jpg", "http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zFk-juC_mB8/Ui49BobEGiI/AAAAAAAAAY8/TCNvBGnnPhU/s320/Help-Ism-Ghawth-al-Adhim-3.jpg", "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sebLMREQ6tA/U9RPapDvxPI/AAAAAAAAEds/4GEkFDe_Cr4/s1600/Barbra-Streisand-Plastic-Surgery.jpg", "http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZNGiuPCRVqE/UYuZfjlPPNI/AAAAAAAADiI/1_CRHpTJ83A/s320/11.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.rssing.com/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Jennifer Garner \u2013 Gossip Cop", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "optiads": "OTZZUW5CQ2xBSFgrN0FUUlYxUHRTZz09"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://garner315.rssing.com", "summary": ""}
