The first episode for Caitlyn Jenner\u2018s brand-new E! docuseries, I Am Cait, shows the former Olympian continually moving along in her transition from male to female, with the support of close friends and her famous family members.\n\nUs Weekly rounds up the top five moments from the premiere, screened to press in NYC and L.A., on Tuesday, July 21, including revelations like Caitlyn\u2019s friendship with Kris\u2018 former best friend Ronda Kamihira, her mom\u2019s reaction to her debut as a woman, as well as Kanye West\u2018s thoughts on her societal impact.\n\n1. Who Is Ronda Kamihira?\n\nAfter Caitlyn (previously known as Bruce) finalized her divorce last fall, the former decathlete stepped out with her ex\u2019s longtime best friend and former assistant Ronda Kamihira \u2014 and it was rumored that they were dating. A source told Us at the time that while Kamihira and Caitlyn attended an Elton John concert together, joined by Brandon and Leah Jenner last October, it was unclear whether they were actually a couple.\n\nIn the debut episode, Kamihira\u2019s relationship with Caitlyn is fully revealed, and it\u2019s not romantic at all. She is introduced as Caitlyn\u2019s assistant and her close friend, and the two share a surprising bond. Caitlyn says in her docuseries that she began confiding in Ronda about transitioning close to two years ago. Ronda even helped her pick the name \u201cCaitlyn.\u201d\n\n2. Esther Jenner Meets Caitlyn for the First Time Ever\n\nEsther Jenner \u2014 Kylie, Kendall, Brandon, and Brody\u2018s maternal grandmother \u2014 has continually voiced her public support for Caitlyn, even prior to the star\u2019s sit-down interview with Diane Sawyer, during which the athlete confirmed, \u201cFor all intents and purposes, I am a woman.\u201d\n\nIn the first few scenes of I Am Cait\u2018s premiere, Caitlyn is seen nervously pacing at home, because her sisters and her mother are on their way over. This is the first time the family has been all together in a whopping four years, and Caitlyn is fretting because Esther has yet to meet Cait. She wonders how she should sign her mother\u2019s birthday card \u2014 as Bruce or as Caitlyn? (Spoiler alert: She ends up signing it as Caitlyn).\n\nWhen the family arrives, Cait says to her mom, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.\u201d Esther replied, \u201cI knew it would be,\u201d as the entire clan hugs in the entryway. In her one-off with the camera, the Jenner family matriarch has sweet notes about Cait\u2019s new appearance. \u201cI think he\u2019s a very good looking woman,\u201d Esther muses. \u201cHe\u2019s still Bruce. I love him so much.\u201d While making an effort, she admits that the transition will require \u201ca lot of getting used to.\u201d They also meet with a therapist, who helps facilitate a larger conversation with the family. \u201cI really want to learn more,\u201d Esther repeats throughout the episode. \u201cI need to understand more\u201d\n\nIn another scene, Caitlyn\u2019s mom tears up as she discusses how \u201cit\u2019s not easy\u201d getting used to the newfound identity of her child. The supportive mom gets visibly emotional. \u201cYou have the same soul you were born with,\u201d she notes to Cait.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Kardashian Christmas cards through the years Enlisting the help of celeb photographer David LaChapelle in 2013, the family changed up their Christmas card style by posing on a futuristic, carnival-like set for a panoramic snapshot. Noticeably missing from the photo were Rob Kardashian, Scott Disick, Lamar Odom, and Kim\u2019s fiance Kanye West and daughter North. Thank You! You have successfully subscribed. [\u2026]\n\n3. Kylie Sees Caitlyn for the First Time Ever \u2014 Via FaceTime!\n\nCaitlyn\u2019s youngest daughter Kylie, 17, sees her for the first time ever as a woman via FaceTime. The teen, who graduated from high school this past week, is waking up from anesthesia in a dentist\u2019s chair when she sees Cait in her female form. \u201cYou look so pretty!\u201d Kylie gushes, still slightly out of it from her operation.\n\nLater, Kylie comes over to see her in person and puts teal ombre hair extensions (from her own line, ha!) in Cait\u2019s hair. Kendall\u2019s younger sister says she was Google-imaging snapshots to figure out the best color scheme.\n\nAfter Kylie leaves, Cait expresses how excited she is about her daughter being accepting and gracious. Cait tells her sister that Kylie never really wanted to come by before, and she\u2019s glad that she finally did.\n\n4. Kim and Kanye Make a Brief and Memorable Cameo\n\nThe superstar couple\u2019s brief appearance in the premiere is marked with their usual antics \u2014 Kanye West gives a very sincere and philosophical statement, while stepdaughter Kim Kardashian pulls some tricks in the closet.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up,\u201d the rapper says to Caitlyn as he gives her a hug. West then tells Cait that she\u2019s \u201cchanging society in the most meaningful way,\u201d adding that what the former Olympian did was \u201cone of the strongest things that have happened\u201d in her entire lifetime. \u201cYou\u2019re a celebrity, your daughter is a supermodel, and you\u2019re saying this is who I am.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kim brings some comic relief to the episode as she raids Cait\u2019s closet and sifts through her newly revamped wardrobe. The Vogue cover girl largely approves most of the items in Cait\u2019s closet with the exception of one maxi dress. Caitlyn has a lot of items from Diane von Furstenberg and Tom Ford that the designers themselves have sent over directly.\n\n\u201cI love this Tom Ford dress,\u201d Cait tells North West\u2018s mom. Kim then notes that Kris has the same Tom Ford dress in a different color. The two joke about setting the momager up for a \u201cWho Wore It Best\u201d (shout-out to Us Weekly!). Kim jokes that she\u2019ll invite Cait over when Kris is in the dress.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Caitlyn Jenner's best style moments \u2014 so far! She\u2019s here\u2014and she\u2019s fabulous!

Caitlyn, who confessed at one point in the episode that she contemplated suicide, then attends a memorial with Kyler\u2019s friends and family. Together, the group releases memorial balloons on the beach in San Diego.\n\nBONUS!\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
