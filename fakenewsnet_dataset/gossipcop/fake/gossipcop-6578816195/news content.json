Kidman said they call each other instead.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done this since the very beginning. The reason it started at the beginning was because I didn\u2019t know how to text and it just kind of worked for us. So now we don\u2019t,\u201d Kidman told Parade. \u201cWe just do voice to voice or skin to skin, as we always say. We talk all the time and we FaceTime but we just don\u2019t text because I feel like texting can be misrepresentative at times.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve had the thing where I reread texts and I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d and then read it to somebody and go \u2018Can you interpret that?\u2019 I don\u2019t want that between my lover and I.\u201d\n\nNICOLE KIDMAN REVEALS HER 'MASSIVE GRIEF' AFTER HAVING A MISCARRIAGE DURING HER MARRIAGE TO TOM CRUISE\n\n\"The reason it started at the beginning was because I didn\u2019t know how to text and it just kind of worked for us.\" \u2014 Nicole Kidman\n\nAs far as how else to have a long marriage? Kidman said to be open with each other.\n\n\u201cWe never tell anybody any advice about their relationship or think that we have a secret. We just approach it with humility and hope and just really love hanging out,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean it\u2019s that simple. We love spending time together. We have a lot of fun together and we just choose each other. If there is one person I can hang out with, it\u2019s him and the girls and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nKidman and Urban shared their wedding anniversary on Monday. The two shared sweet Instagram messages about their love.\n\nThe two married in 2006 and have two daughters: Sunday Rose 9, and Faith Margaret, 7.
