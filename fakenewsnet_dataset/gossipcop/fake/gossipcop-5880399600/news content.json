Tanaka also was photographed offering Carey a forkful of food.\n\nCarey, 47, had posted a nostalgic photo of a date she shared with Tanaka, 33, on Friday, captioning,\u201c#fbf.\u201d\n\nAfter calling it quits with fianc\u00e9 James Packer in October, Carey embarked on a whirlwind romance with her backup dancer Tanaka, with the pair spending holidays together and traveling the world. News of their split came last month with a source close to Carey telling PEOPLE it was the singer who ended things.\n\n\u201cEveryone hoped that she would,\u201d the Carey source said. \u201cShe has better things to focus on. Mariah is happy. She is focusing on her kids and new music.\u201d\n\nThe insider added, \u201cBryan was a good distraction after she split from James. This is a good time for her to be single and focus on herself.\u201d\n\n#fbf A post shared by Mariah Carey (@mariahcarey) on May 19, 2017 at 9:00pm PDT\n\nFROM PEN: Nick Cannon on His Broadway Inspiration for Wild\u2019n Out\n\nTMZ first reported the news that Carey had broken up with Tanaka due to his spending habits and his jealousy over her relationship with ex-husband Nick Cannon, with whom she shares 6-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan.\n\nThe former couple, who split in 2014 and divorced in November, continue to remain close as co-parents of their children, and their bond reportedly irked Tanaka, leading him to flirt with other women in front of Carey as revenge.\n\nEarlier this month, PEOPLE reported that there was \u201chope\u201d that Cannon and Carey would get back together and the two had been \u201cgetting along great.\u201d", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/beyonce-10.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/swish-swish.jpg?crop=834px%2C152px%2C969px%2C649px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/mariah-carey7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1925px%2C1010.625px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/chris-cornell-17th-4-2000.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1332.7428571429px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/prince-rogers-nelson.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1332.7428571429px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/britney-spears5.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C2001px%2C1338px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/musicians-gone-too-soon-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C802.85714285714px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/mariah-carey7.jpg?w=450", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/gettyimages-681496294.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/ruby-rose2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1560px%2C1045px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/katy-perry-kim-kardashian-1.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1332.7428571429px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/mariah-carey7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1925px%2C1010.625px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Richter"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170521171711/http://people.com/music/mariah-carey-bryan-tanaka-kiss-date-back-together/", "title": "Back On?
