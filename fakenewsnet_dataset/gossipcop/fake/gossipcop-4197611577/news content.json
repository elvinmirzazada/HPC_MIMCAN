In the clip, Rodriguez is giving the camera Blue Steel vibes as he nods along to Lopez's rendition of Journey's 1981 hit, \"Don't Stop Believin'.\"\n\nClad in a white collared shirt, Rodriguez looks thrilled to be spending some time the 49-year-old triple-threat star, who opted for a floral printed dress for the nighttime ride. \"What did you guys think of my performance?! #dontstopbelieving,\" the dad of two captioned the clip.\n\nIt looks like the pair spent all day on the water together! Earlier on his Instagram Story, Rodriguez shared videos and pics of their vacation.

They are both driven business people with the same background and are passionate about their charitable efforts,\" the source noted. \"Their families are now blended and live together.\"\n\nHere's more on the power couple:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/jloarodvidpic.jpg?h=e8a55521", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2Fjloarodvidpic.jpg%3Fh%3De8a55521&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2021-07/Jennifer_Lopez_3x_Getty_MAIN_1920.jpg?h=b8626526&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2Fjennifer_lopez_alex_rodriguez_gettyimages-912865356.jpg%3Fh%3Df8aed7c2&w=256&q=75", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-12%2Fjennifer_lopez_alex_rodriguez_gettyimages-871126986.jpg%3Fh%3Dc146e78c&w=256&q=75", "http://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-05%2Fgettyimages-955778620.jpg%3Fh%3D8b41e9ec&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/jloarodvidpic.jpg?h=e8a55521", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jennifer-lopez-serenades-alex-rodriguez-with-journeys-dont-stop-believin-107457", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Serenades Alex Rodriguez With Journey's 'Don't Stop Believin'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/jloarodvidpic.jpg?h=e8a55521", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "They're so cute!", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Serenades Alex Rodriguez", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jennifer-lopez-serenades-alex-rodriguez-with-journeys-dont-stop-believin-107457", "type": "Article"}, "description": "They're so cute!", "twitter": {"description": "They're so cute!", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Serenades Alex Rodriguez", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jennifer-lopez-serenades-alex-rodriguez-with-journeys-dont-stop-believin-107457", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/jloarodvidpic.jpg?h=e8a55521", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Jennifer Lopez Serenades Alex Rodriguez With Journey's 'Don't Stop Believin' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
