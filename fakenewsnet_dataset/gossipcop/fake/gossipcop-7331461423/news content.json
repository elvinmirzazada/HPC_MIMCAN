He told CNN's Piers Morgan that the tea party's opposition to Mr. Obama, the nation's first black president, is rooted in racism.\n\nFreeman claims tea partiers will do whatever it takes to \"get this black man out of here.\"\n\nHe adds that the tea party shows the \"weak, dark underside of America,\" and that \"we're supposed to be better than that.\"\n\nThe only black Republican candidate for president pushed right back. Businessman and tea party member Herman Cain says most of the people who criticize the movement have never been to a tea party rally.\n\nCain says \"name calling\" will continue because opponents don't know how to stop the tea party movement.\n\nMeanwhile - with black leaders grumbling that Mr. Obama hasn't done enough about staggering black unemployment - the president has evoked language that sounds a whole lot like the civil rights era.\n\nHe told the Congressional Black Caucus to march with him: \"Take off your bedroom slippers, put on your marching shoes.\"\n\nAmericans are split on how Mr. Obama's presidency has changed race relations in the U.S.\n\nA recent USA Today/Gallup poll shows 35% of those surveyed said race relations have improved, while 23% say they've gotten worse under President Obama.\n\n41% percent see no change.\n\nBack in 2008, when the nation voted for \"hope and change,\" Americans had a much rosier view of what this president would do for race relations.\n\nGallup found that the day after Mr. Obama was elected, a whopping 70% predicted race relations would improve.\n\nHere\u2019s my question to you: Has President Obama made racism worse?\n\nTune in to the Situation Room at 5pm to see if Jack reads your answer on air.\n\nAnd, we love to know where you\u2019re writing from, so please include your city and state with your comment.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/header/nav-arrow.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/global/nav/footer/dark/bg_dark/japanese_dark_bg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/1px.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/08/12/tzsrch.obama.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/08/12/tzsrch.2012.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/global/nav/footer/dark/bg_dark/turkish_dark_bg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/08/15/tzsrch.jack.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://a3.twimg.com/profile_images/67228968/icon.jackcafferty_normal.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/misc/logo_ad_choices_footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?cj=1c1=2&c2=7518284", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/global/nav/footer/dark/bg_dark/arabic_dark_bg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/global/nav/footer/dark/footer_cnn_logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/header/hdr-main.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/global/misc/advertisement.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/mosaic/base_skins/right_rail/grey_corner_TL.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/mosaic/base_skins/right_rail/grey_corner_BL.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/08/12/tzsrch.sitroom.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif?m=1308100503g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/global/icons/btn_close.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/global/nav/footer/dark/bg_dark/chinese_dark_bg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/images/1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-18-mFEk4J448M.gif?labels=%2Clanguage.en%2Ctype.wpcom%2Cposttag.cnns-jack-cafferty%2Cvip.cnncaffertyfile", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/sect/blogs/ac360/home.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2011/images/08/12/tzsrch.nyse.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://s0.wp.com/imgpress?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnewspulse.cnn.com%2Fimages%2Fno_image_cnn_90x51.jpg&resize=90,51"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641im_/http://s0.wp.com/imgpress?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnewspulse.cnn.com%2Fimages%2Fno_image_cnn_90x51.jpg&resize=90,51", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110930082641/http://caffertyfile.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/27/has-president-obama-made-racism-worse/", "title": "Has President Obama made racism worse? \u2013 Cafferty File", "meta_data": {"title": "Has President Obama made racism worse?", "description": "FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty: President Obama has made racism worse in America.
