The couple had fun going on a country walk with their dog Olive, and their six-year-old daughter Harper, following the recent speculation that they are separating. Taking to Instagram Stories, Victoria shared footage of their day out, showing David turning around to look lovingly at her as they made their way through the field. \"Happy Saturday\", she captioned the post.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, David and Victoria Beckham were forced to deny that they were splitting up after social media was rife with rumours that the pair were preparing to announce their divorce. The couple addressed the allegations, with a representative for the Beckhams telling HELLO!: \"There is no impending statement, no divorce.\" They also told other outlets that the reports were a \"very bizarre and an embarrassing waste of time\".\n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham enjoyed spending time together in the countryside\n\nMORE: Victoria Beckham ignores divorce rumours in the most STUNNING outfit\n\nThe couple have since been seen out together on a number of occasions, most recently at a meal with their three sons, Brooklyn, Romeo and Cruz, to celebrate a family friend's birthday.
