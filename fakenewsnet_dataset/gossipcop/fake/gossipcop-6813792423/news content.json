He pointed out, \"There's nothing wrong with that. Shit, he's doing his thing.\" *NSYNC's members most recently regrouped for a one-off performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nTMZ's cameraperson also asked if Fatone thought Timberlake would bring Janet Jackson out during his performance as a nod to their controversial wardrobe malfunction incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII.\n\nWhile Fatone couldn't confirm or deny a Jackson appearance, he did say, \"He's not that kind of person. He's not controversial like that.\" Then, appearing to realize that Timberlake has had his share of controversial moments, Fatone added, \"He is in a sense, but not in a sense to do it deliberately.\"\n\nTimberlake is set to perform at the Super Bowl in Minneapolis, MN on February 4, 2018 as the Philadelphia Eagles take on the New England Patriots.", "images": ["https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/19/campaign_images/d352281cd473/baby-keem-navigates-the-melodic-blue-in-new-trail-3-972-1701200839-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/19/campaign_images/874ca2637b5e/young-thugs-lawyer-says-rappers-name-stands-for-t-3-923-1701200650-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/20/campaign_images/b1ce44a7ffd9/travis-scott-tells-couple-to-stop-fighting-during-3-1354-1701202328-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/zxvoGfXi/poster.jpg?width=320", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/user_images/MhdbTlVIz_large.jpg?output-format=jpg", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/21/campaign_images/9346e0158869/tina-knowles-slams-trolls-who-said-beyonce-looks--3-1663-1701207188-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/20/campaign_images/9346e0158869/video-shows-man-being-knocked-out-by-nardo-wicks--3-1424-1701203039-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/29/0/campaign_images/01ac8f36ed7a/uncle-luke-denies-gloria-velezs-grooming-allegati-3-2172-1701216252-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/29/0/campaign_images/01ac8f36ed7a/erykah-badu-on-daughter-puma-being-her-personal-a-3-2303-1701218910-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/23/campaign_images/874ca2637b5e/harvard-university-of-florida-are-latest-schools--3-1592-1701212989-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/22/campaign_images/2c9d5474c342/diddys-partnership-with-charter-preparatory-schoo-3-1558-1701212147-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2022-12/8/4/tmp/181c0e3eec91/tmp-name-3-999-1670474019-15_dblbig.jpg", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/21/campaign_images/20214ffbad8f/gunna-and-young-thugs-pushin-p-referenced-in-ysl--3-1281-1701205224-1_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top"], "top_img": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2022-12/8/4/tmp/181c0e3eec91/tmp-name-3-999-1670474019-15_dblbig.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eric Skelton", "Eric Is The Head Of Music At Complex.
