Markle\u2019s father, Thomas Markle, only added to the speculation when he appeared on the U.K.\u2019s Good Morning Britain this week and said \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a stork in the air yet but I think it will happen sooner or later.\u201d\n\nIn so many ways, Meghan Markle\u2019s life as a Duchess is different from what most newlywed women experience, but in this way, it\u2019s pretty similar. While other women don\u2019t have millions of eyes watching them the way Markle does, constantly being asked if you\u2019re pregnant or trying to conceive can make a woman feel like she does.\n\nActress Gabrielle Union has previously stated that this isn\u2019t just a problem for women in the spotlight, like her and Markle, but for many women. \u201cPeople feel very entitled to know, \u2018Do you want kids?'\u201d Union said while promoting her book, We\u2019re Going to Need More Wine. \u201cA lot of people, especially people that have fertility issues, just say \u2018no\u2019 because that\u2019s a lot easier than being honest about whatever is actually going on. People mean so well, but they have no idea the harm or frustration it can cause.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle did go on record as being team kids during their first post-interview engagement with the BBC. When asked the kid question, Prince Harry replied, \u201cI think eventually, one step at a time and we\u2019ll start a family in the near future.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s happening right this moment.\n\nIf Meghan Markle and Prince Harry ever announce that a royal baby is on the way, we will be so happy for them, but until that day comes, we\u2019d be happy if everyone but the couple kept the stork talk to themselves.\n\nPlanning a pregnancy is a personal, often private decision\u2026even if you are the one of the most famous women in the world.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/themes/motherly/assets/svg/arrowRight.svg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/motherly-logo.svg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/is-meghan-markle-pregnant-featured.jpg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ARTICLE-HERO-Sand-Background-2023-11-28T131847.319-450x360.jpg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tampon-test-tiktok-450x360.jpg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/princess-eugenie-450x360.jpg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/accidental-thc-ingestion-450x360.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20360'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/paris-hilton-christmas-450x360.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2048%2048'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/baby-eating-shopping-cart-450x360.jpg", "http://www.mother.ly/wp-content/themes/motherly/assets/svg/hero-flower-1.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20273%20487'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/is-meghan-markle-pregnant-featured.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Heather Marcoux"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mother.ly/news/celebrity-news/is-meghan-markle-pregnant/", "title": "Meghan Markle\u2019s pregnancy plans are her business\u2014and nobody else\u2019s", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Wondering about Meghan Markle's pregnancy plans?
