The family returned to the US and ultimately settled in Pennsylvania, where they welcomed her younger sister, Rachel, in 1986. Aguilera has spoken out about her father's physically and emotionally abusive behavior.[14] She eventually used music to escape her turbulent household.[15] In 1987, Shelly filed to divorce Fausto and moved with her children to her mother's home in Rochester, a suburb of Pittsburgh.[16] She later married James Kearns with whom she had a son named Michael. In 2012, following decades of estrangement, Aguilera expressed interest in reconciling with her biological father.[18]\n\nDuring childhood, Aguilera explored her grandmother's personal records\u2014which featured mostly soul and blues singers\u2014which increased her interest in music.[19] She also began to practice singing and competing in talent contests. Followed numerous contests, she earned reputation in the neighborhood as the \"little girl with a big voice\" and received attention from local television and radio programs.[22] In 1990, she performed the popular song \"A Sunday Kind of Love\" on the reality competition show Star Search, but was eliminated during the semi-final round.[23] Aguilera eventually was invited to sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, Pittsburgh Steelers football, and Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games, as well during the 1992 Stanley Cup Finals.[25] During her youth in Pittsburgh metropolitan area, she attended North Allegheny Intermediate High School before leaving there to be homeschooled to avoid bullying she experienced at school.[27]\n\nCareer\n\n1993\u20131998: Career beginnings\n\nIn 1991, Aguilera auditioned for a position on The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (MMC), aired on the Disney Channel. She ran against 400 candidates, and while she made the shortlist she was ultimately rejected for not meeting the minimum age requirement. One year later, in 1992, Aguilera received a call from one of the show's producers asking if she was still interested in becoming a \"Mouseketeer\". She once again competed for a spot (this time, against 15,000 candidates) and was selected to join the variety program the following year. Her fellow cast members included Ryan Gosling, Keri Russell, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake.[30] During the show recordings\u2014which included Aguilera performing musical numbers and comedy sketches\u2014she moved with her family to Orlando, Florida.[31] In 1994, it was reported the series would not return for a new season.\n\nAiming to begin a music career, Aguilera moved to Japan in 1997. She was selected to record a duet with Japanese singer Keizo Nakanishi, with whom she performed in concert shows around the country. Their song, \"All I Wanna Do\" was released as a single but failed to reach commercial success. In June 1997, Aguilera went on to Romania to represent the United States in a singers contest during the Golden Stag Festival, but she failed to win over the audience.\n\nSeeking a recording contract, Aguilera recorded numerous demo tapes directed to record labels, including Walt Disney Records, for which she sent a cover of \"Run to You\" by Whitney Houston. She eventually was chosen to record \"Reflection\", the theme song from the animated film Mulan (1998), which reached number 15 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. Following the attention she received with \"Reflection\", Aguilera caught the ear of Ron Fair, the A&R executive from RCA Records, who consequently signed Aguilera to the label.[11] In late 1998, she began to record her debut studio album into which producers reportedly invested over $1 million worth of writers, producers and vocal lessons.[11]\n\n1999\u20132001: Breakthrough with debut album\n\nIn May 1999, Aguilera released the lead single off her long-awaited debut album, \"Genie in a Bottle\", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks and became the second best-selling single of 1999.[37] The song became an international hit, increasing Aguilera's popularity worldwide, topping the charts in over 20 countries.[38] The single also attracted the attention of conservatives including celebrities such as Debbie Gibson that spoke out against its lyrical content, and was eventually considered \"too provocative\" to be sung by a teen idol.[40] Due to the criticism, Radio Disney replaced the song with a censored version.[41] The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[42]\n\nAguilera's self-titled debut album, Christina Aguilera, was released on August 24, 1999 to critical praise and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.[43] It catapulted Aguilera into fame globally and sold over ten million copies in its first year.[44] It was later certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[45] and has sold over 17 million copies worldwide.[46][47] Originally, Aguilera's desire was to create material directly inspired by R&B and soul, but the label opted for a more teen pop production due the genre's high financial return in the late 1990s.[48] At the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, Aguilera won the Best New Artist category for which Time credited the award for \"[helping] certify her credentials as a real singer\".[49]\n\nI was completely blown away, shocked, overwhelmed and thrilled. I didn't expect it. I've dreamed of that since I was eight years old. I was rambling off the top of my head, my knees were shaking and I'm still floating on air because of it! \u2014Aguilera on winning Best New Artist at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nAfter the album's release, \"What a Girl Wants\", topped the Hot 100 and is recognised as the first new number one entry on the chart for the 2000's decade.

She later recalled shaping her singing voice after them in her early years.\n\nAguilera has named Etta James as a \"role model\", and said \"At Last\" made a major impression on her. She later stated, \"I'll still be as raunchy as I wanna be, and I'll have [Etta]'s memory to back me up. She's what I want to be someday\".[327] As a young girl, The Sound of Music (1959) and its lead actress, Julie Andrews, became her early references to sing and perform, in addition to broadening her interest on Broadway.[328] Aguilera's other major influences include Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald.[329] She has also cited rock bands as an influence, specifically the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, and Radiohead.[332]\n\nAguilera was also influenced by Latin music. She later recalled singing her first songs in Spanish during childhood, saying: \"I grew up hearing [Spanish] being spoken in my household [and] hearing a lot of Julio Iglesias on the record player\". Some of her other inspirations in Latin music include Chavela Vargas, Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez, and younger artists such Rosal\u00eda.[334][335] As a performer, Aguilera credits Madonna and Janet Jackson as major inspirations for being \"positive female artists [who] aren't afraid to take chances, be daring, experimental and sexy\".[336] Cher also encouraged her to being a performer and \"a woman who has the guts to do [everything]\".[337]\n\nAguilera's childhood visits to records stores moulded her taste and led to an appreciation for blues and soul music, which she called \"music that really had heart\".[338] Her music has also paid homage to many artists from this genre, including Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye, Nina Simone, and Otis Redding. Her album Back to Basics (2006) features inspirations of musicians from the early 20th century. As she later commented: \"I was just so drawn to that [kind of music] ... [It] has so much pain, so much beauty of raw emotion and passion\".[14] Her other influences in the genre was added for Liberation (2018), including Michael Jackson in \"Maria\" and Janis Joplin in \"Sick of Sittin'\".[339][250]\n\nOutside of the music industry, Aguilera was inspired by actresses from the Old Hollywood.[340] She later stated, \"I'm fascinated with the golden age of film. I wanted to capture the authenticity of the glam era\", after which she cited examples such as Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe, Greta Garbo, Veronica Lake, and the pin-up models.[341] Her \"Tilt Ya Head Back\" music video also recreated Monroe's signature look, while the video for \"Your Body\" includes a directly reference to Lucille Ball.[342][343] The video for \"Ain't No Other Man\" presented Aguilera under the alter ego Baby Jane, which was inspired by Bette Davis's character in psychological horror film What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962).[344] Her other inspirations mostly came from contemporary art, including works by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Banksy.[345][346]\n\nVoice\n\nAguilera is known by her melismatic singing technique, yielding comparisons to Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey.[2][347]\n\nCritics have described Aguilera as a soprano,[15][348] possessing a four-octave vocal range.[349] She is also able to perform the whistle register.[350] Maura Johnston, a journalist with Slate, called Aguilera's voice \"an instrument that despite its ability to leap octaves has a low-end grounding similar to that possessed by opera singers\".[351] The Boston Globe columnist Joan Anderman highlighted her vocal versatility: \"[She] is a real singer ... blessed with the sort of breathtaking elasticity, golden tones, and sheer power that separate the divas from the dabblers\".[352] In addition to sustain high notes, Aguilera is recognized for making use of the melismatic technique.[2] Jon Pareles from The New York Times emphasized that \"she can aim a note as directly as a missile or turn its trajectory into an aerobatic spiral of leaping, quivering, and scalloping melismas\".[250] Ron Fair\u2014A&R executive from RCA Records\u2014was impressed by her \"perfect intonation\", and concluded: \"She's got the pipes to be the next Barbra Streisand or C\u00e9line Dion\".[329]\n\nAguilera's singing technique also yielded comparisons to other singers. Journalist David Browne suggested that, alongside Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston, she \"forms the team of the main proponents\" of the melismatic technique.[347] Richard Harrington from The Washington Post also noticed similarities with both artists: \"She has a genuinely powerful voice that's evoked comparisons [to them], though it for the most part avoids those singers' ornamental mannerisms\".[353] The New Yorker columnist Sasha Frere-Jones also credited the technique by making her become \"a serious singer without needing to reincarnate the Sarah Vaughan\".[354] Songwriter Steve Kipner praises Aguilera's vocal dexterity, including her ability to \"internalize[d] all the riffs from Chaka Khan\".[329] Los Angeles Times music critic Ann Powers wrote that she possesses a \"voice purely powerful as that of Etta James [...] and she's moving toward the expressiveness of Gladys Knight, if not Aretha Franklin\". Powers also associated her vocal ability with Donna Summer when she performs records influenced by rhythm and blues.[355]\n\nAguilera, however, has also been criticized for the excessive use of melisma, as well for oversinging during her concerts shows.[356][129] The Huffington Post columnist John Eskow called her as \"the main proponent of oversouling\". Eskow recognizes Aguilera's voice as a \"great instrument\", although she \"[doesn't] seem to know when to stop\" with the use of \"gratuitous and confected melisma\".[357] Lucy Davies, music critic from BBC Music, raved about her \"stunning voice\", but offered that \"she could be more varied, simply by cutting out some of the 'ye-e-eeeh, woah' in her songs\".[358] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willman credits Aguilera's tendency to oversinging as an influence of Mariah Carey, noting \"her slightly nasal tone that really only becomes obvious when she's overselling a song\".[359] Alexa Tietjen from VH1 acknowledged that Aguilera \"does tend to take it to the extreme at times [...] but her vocal prowess is what's gotten her so far. Love them or hate them, the riffs are a part of who she is as performer\".[360]\n\nMusical style\n\nAguilera's discography is generally categorized as pop, contemporary R&B, soul, and hip-hop.[362][363] According to critics, she has also experimented with other musical genres in her works. In a 2008 interview, she explained that she is \"always inspired by new things\" in music and enjoys \"experimenting with [her] voice\".[154] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian considered the \"boldness in [continually] reinventing\" her music as \"one of her most impressive facets\" as an artist.[364] Initially established as a bubblegum pop singer, she mixed teen pop and dance-pop on her first records, Christina Aguilera (1999) and Mi Reflejo (2000), with the latter also taking inspiration from numerous genres in Latin music.[353][365]\n\nMoving away from the teen niche, Aguilera's post-2000 material mainly incorporated R&B and hip-hop.[362][80] Listed as an executive producer on Stripped (2002), she mixed both genres with Latin pop, rock, neo-soul, gospel, among others, while Back to Basics (2006) was described as a \"throwback with elements of old-school genres combined with a modern-day twist [and] hard-hitting beats\".[366][124] She continued merging R&B with other musical styles on Burlesque (2010), as well on Liberation (2018), which also features hip-hop, soul and blues elements.[367][368]\n\nThe show tune \"Lady Marmalade\" is noted as Aguilera's first musical transformation. Referred to as \"too urban\" by RCA Records executives, the song transitioned her music \"from teen pop to a more mature sound\".[117][369] Despite the renewal in her repertoire, Aguilera continued producing power ballads\u2014which became a signature in her discography\u2014in between her uptempo material.[370] Kelefa Sanneh, music critic from The New York Times, observed the continuous modification in her music, in addition to highlighting her \"decision to snub some of the big-name producers on whom pop stars often rely\".[371] Her notable sonically drastic ventures include the subversive futurepop on Bionic (2010),[372] electropop club on Lotus (2012),[373] and Mexican ranchera numbers on Aguilera (2022).[374]\n\nLyrical themes\n\nThe themes in her music portrays women as full human beings with subjectivity and renders women agency in owning their thoughts, speaking their mind, and practicing self-empowerment.

Critics have acknowledged domestic violence experienced during childhood as one of the main topics in her music.[376][377] Mary Anne Donovan, author of Christina Aguilera: A Biography (2010), noted that she \"channeled her fear and sadness away from the abuse in her family to instead create the music that became her art and her livelihood\". It also influenced Aguilera's transition to adulthood and impacted many of her songs, whose lyrics reference female empowerment. In a 2006 interview, she commented: \"I feel a responsibility to share some of these things that aren\u2019t kind of the brighter sides of my life. People [who] can relate might not feel as alone in the circumstance\".[381]\n\nAguilera has also often defended the sex-positive movement and denounced social double standards in her music.[97] Reviewing Stripped (2002), Sophie Wilkinson from Vice opined that its music \"explores nuanced articulations of sexual desires and fears while highlighting the social double standards\", in addition to giving \"any woman the confidence to take charge of her sexuality and ownership of her body\".[382] Jennifer K. Armstrong, author of Sexy Feminism: A Girl's Guide to Love, Success, and Style (2013), opined that her music has \"reject[ed] the double standards set forth by sexism and patriarchy\".\n\nChin Wai Wong from Hollins University also observed topics such as romance, introspection of vulnerability, gratitude for support, and sexual liberation in Aguilera's music, representing \"multi-dimensional aspects of life [and] different social responsibilities a woman experiences\".[375] While critics noted the feminist message in her works, Aguilera was acknowledged for her \"refusal to sanitize her own sexuality to meet either the norms of mainstream gender politics or mainline Feminism's resistance\".[384] The Guardian journalist Hermione Hoby opined that she \"incites a sisterly spirit of collaboration [and] is not shy of the odd feministic declaration herself\".[385] Other themes addressed in her lyrics include self-respect, body image, and LGBT rights, in addition to \"fighting for creative freedom and gender equality\".[386][387]\n\nCultural status\n\nPublic image\n\nAguilera at the Disney Legends induction ceremony, 2019.\n\nPublications have called Aguilera a pop icon, a triple threat entertainer, and a diva.[388][389][390] Her vocal abilities distinguished her from her peers, and she has been referred to as the \"Voice of a Generation\".

More generally, she has been recognized for her contributions to American television and music competitions. The New York Times, for example, noted that \"She should also be remembered as the person who almost single-handedly reshaped music competition reality programming\" while journalist Jon Caramanica pointed out that this was done at a time where numerous pop stars were becoming coaches and judges from American Idol and The X Factor.[427] As a coach on The Voice, Aguilera was listed among the highest-paid American television stars,[428] receiving $225,000 per episode in 2011,[429] $10 million per season in 2012,[430] $12 million in 2013,[431] $12.5 million in 2014,[432] and $17 million in 2016.[433]\n\nReinventions and personas\n\nWax statue of Aguilera at Madame Tussauds, London\n\nAguilera is noted for having reinvented her public image numerous times during her career.[434][435] Stereogum writer Tom Breihan noted that she \"thought of herself primarily as a [...] young Mariah Carey-type\",[436] but was instead marketed as a bubblegum pop teen idol due to the genre's popularity in the late 1990s,[437][438][15] following the success of Britney Spears's debut album.[11][439] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly noted that Aguilera was \"a good girl pretending to be bad\" when compared to Spears' music and image.[440] In contrast, Christopher J. Farley of Time considered her a more impressive artist than Spears.[49]\n\nAguilera departed from the teen idol image with the release of Stripped in 2002, by dyeing her hair black, getting body piercings, and posing nude for several publications.[81] This was attributed to her provocative and extravagant alter ego named Xtina.[441] Serving as the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, Aguilera opened the show dressed as a nun, accompanied by a choir singing the lead single from Stripped, \"Dirrty\", before showing off a more revealing outfit.[113] While analyzing her new visual, Vice and Rolling Stone magazines wrote that her new clothes echoed as if she were participating in the Girls Gone Wild franchise.[442][443] In a review of her persona, author Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic opined that Aguilera reached \"maturity with transparent sexuality and pounding sounds of nightclubs\".[444] Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Adam White was more positive about her image and recognized that her \"embracing of an overtly sexual image in the wake of adolescent stardom was a tried and tested route to adult success\".[445]\n\nFor the release of Back to Basics in 2006, Aguilera adopted a new persona named Baby Jane, named after Bette Davis's character in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962).[446] The image drew inspiration from actresses of the Golden Age of Hollywood, such as Marilyn Monroe, to go with the album's 1920s\u20131950s musical direction.[447] Starting in 2008, she adopted a futuristic image, which drew comparisons to the image of then-newcomer, Lady Gaga.[448][449] In 2012, she drew criticism over her weight gain from several publications;[450] the following year, she received favorable media attention after a significant weight loss.[451][452] In March 2018, Aguilera appeared on the cover of the spring 2018 issue of Paper, titled \"Transformation\".[453][454] Photographed by Zoey Grossman, the images featured Aguilera with minimal makeup and no photographic manipulation, debuting her freckles.[455][456] Her appearance in the pictures received significant media attention and widespread praise.[457][458][459][460] This led to other celebrities who had posed similarly receiving attention.[461][462] Starting in 2021, Aguilera began showing off a red-haired look for the promotion of her ninth studio album, Aguilera (2022).[463]\n\nLegacy\n\nVarious music journalists and authors have noted Aguilera's legacy in the entertainment industry[391][366][464] and deemed her as one of the greatest artists in pop music.[465][466] In 2004, she was listed as one of the most influential people in the music market according to The Independent,[467] and was ranked as the eight greatest woman in the phonographic industry by VH1.[468] Early in her career, Aguilera was labeled as a teen idol,[437][469] and has been named as one of the artists who revived teen pop in the late 1990s;[470][471] Time magazine stated that she was a \"pioneer [in] a different type of teen stardom\", crediting her vocal ability as responsible for the phenomenon.[49] Since then, she has been named as one of the greatest singers in contemporary pop music;[472][473] by MTV, she was ranked as one of the best voices in music since the 1980s,[474] while Rolling Stone and Consequence of Sound included her in their lists of greatest singers of all time.[475][476] In 2013, Latina honored her as the best vocalist of Latin origin in history.[477] With the recognition of her vocal ability and influence in the music industry, she has been referred in media with the titles of \"Princess of Pop\"[478][479] and \"Voice of a Generation\".[480][481][482]\n\nAguilera's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, received in 2010\n\nUpon launching her music career in the late 1990s, Aguilera was named as one of the artists who shaped the \"Latin explosion\",[483][484] having contributed to the Latin pop boom in American music in early of the century.[485] Considered one of the greatest artists of the 2000s,[125][486] she has been classified between the main references of the Millennials;[487] writing for Vice magazine, Wanna Thompson analyzed her impact in the turn of the century, stating that alongside Britney Spears, \"Aguilera dominated mainstream pop-related discussions. [Her] perfectly packaged music and looks appealed to tweens and teens who wanted to be like the pretty, chart-topping pop stars plastered everywhere\".[488] The commercial success of her first projects as a bubblegum pop singer caused an effect that influenced record labels to invest in new artists who attracted the same youthful appeal, catapulting names like Jessica Simpson and Mandy Moore.[489][490]\n\nCritics also highlighted the impact of her work in popular culture; while Stripped (2002) was called \"the blueprint for divas making the transition from teen idol to adult pop star\",[491] Aguilera is credited for \"paving the way for a generation of pop singers\".[482][492] Jeff Benjamin from Billboard stated that the album explored a \"process of self-identification and declaration still influencing today's mainstream scene\", in addition to \"how of today's biggest pop stars have followed a similar path, exploring and incorporating these strategies into their careers\".[366] In 2007, her self-titled debut album was added to the definitive list from Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, being recognized as one of the \"history's most influential and popular albums\".[493] Since then, Aguilera and her work have influenced various recording artists including Ariana Grande,[494] Ava Max,[495] Becky G,[496] Britney Spears,[497] Camila Cabello,[498] Charli XCX,[499] Demi Lovato,[500] Doja Cat,[501] Dua Lipa,[502] Grimes,[503] Halsey,[504] Hayley Williams,[505] Iggy Azalea,[506] Karol G,[507] Kelly Clarkson,[475] Lady Gaga,[508] Lauren Jauregui,[509][510] Meghan Trainor,[511] Nicki Nicole,[512] Olivia Rodrigo,[513] Rina Sawayama,[514] Rosal\u00eda,[515] Sabrina Carpenter,[516] Sam Smith,[517] Selena Gomez,[518] K.
