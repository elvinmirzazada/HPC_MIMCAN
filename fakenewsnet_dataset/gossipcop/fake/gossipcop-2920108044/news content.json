Her biggest acting job since then is dark British TV comedy \"Sick Note,\" in which she plays a supporting role in the second season that began airing last week.\n\nThe Mykonos beach club is Lohan's third business venture in Greece following the 2016 opening of a nightclub bearing her name in Athens and a beach house in Rhodes which is due to open this summer.\n\nReporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Susan Thomas\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "images": ["https://www.reuters.com/pf/resources/images/reuters/reuters-default.webp?d=163", "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/XHD4O3JBCBMUHOH4E424GMIIXQ.jpg", "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/Z47SQSCY5VIXPCCEHT5CKIMC6U.jpg", "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/AE6BNNRLSVAQTFG5XHTC4AV6YI.jpg", "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/VFYKPTQ53JLPDFYEXAK2FRINCY.jpg", "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/2SV5QUYTGRKPHFAZ2DZCJTRMIM.jpg", "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/LA4GRMEOB5J2XOX2ZN33WZQGDU.jpg", "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/AOAO252U2JOWDPD5442M4DYMH4.jpg", "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/7QDPIOKXGNP3VOW4OCG7JDT4EE.jpg", "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/PSDW5CYMDVIMDFLKCPFH7OQCAQ.jpg", "https://archive-images.prod.global.a201836.reutersmedia.net/2018/07/30/LYNXMPEE6T1IF.JPG", "https://archive-images.prod.global.a201836.reutersmedia.net/2018/07/31/LYNXMPEE6U05W.JPG", "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/QBMDACQ2FZNEVFHMNKHXXGVR3U.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.reuters.com/pf/resources/images/reuters/reuters-default.webp?d=163", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.comarticle/idUSKBN1KK281/", "title": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "meta_data": {"render_timestamp": "2023-11-29T01:35:07.423Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=602660809, app-argument=https://www.reuters.comarticle/idUSKBN1KK281/?id=KBN1KK27E", "fb": {"app_id": 988502044532272, "pages": 114050161948682, "admins": 988502044532272}, "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "CCBot": "nofollow", "og": {"title": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.reuters.com/pf/resources/images/reuters/reuters-default.webp?d=163", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/pf/resources/images/reuters/reuters-default.webp?d=163", "width": 1200, "height": 628, "alt": "Reuters logo"}, "url": "https://www.reuters.comarticle/idUSKBN1KK281/", "description": "Lindsay Lohan, whose promising movie career crashed in a string of legal woes and substance abuse, is returning to U.S. television in a reality series about her nightclub ventures in Greece.", "locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "en_US"}, "site_name": "Reuters", "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-31T04:01:39.000Z"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-31T04:01:39.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-07-30T18:56:24.000Z", "author": "Reuters", "section": "Lifestyle", "tag": "CLEB,ENT,EUROP,GR,LIF,MTPIX,MTVID,PRO,PXP,TELE,US,VID", "content_tier": "metered"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "description": "Lindsay Lohan, whose promising movie career crashed in a string of legal woes and substance abuse, is returning to U.S. television in a reality series about her nightclub ventures in Greece.", "title": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.reuters.com/pf/resources/images/reuters/reuters-default.webp?d=163", "alt": "Reuters logo"}}, "keywords": "CLEB,ENT,EUROP,GR,LIF,MTPIX,MTVID,PRO,PXP,TELE,US,VID", "description": "Lindsay Lohan, whose promising movie career crashed in a string of legal woes and substance abuse, is returning to U.S. television in a reality series about her nightclub ventures in Greece.", "analyticsAttributes.topicChannel": "Lifestyle", "DCSext.DartZone": "/4735792/reuters.com/lifestyle/article", "DCSext.ChannelList": "Lifestyle;", "title": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series | Reuters", "ad": {"template": "article"}, "analytics": {"page_layout": "regular-article", "ad_layout": "leaderboard, right rail, sponsored"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533009699.0, "source": "http://www.reuters.com", "summary": ""}
