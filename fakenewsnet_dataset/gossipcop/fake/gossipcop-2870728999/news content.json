But despite her rising star power, Tamblyn said that her agent encouraged her to lose weight. \"I think at that point I was 128 pounds and I\u2019m 5'7\". I remember my agent saying to me \u2014 and she was a woman \u2014 \u2018You have a real choice here. You can either be Nicole Kidman or you can be a character actress,\u2019 \u201d Tamblyn said during a conversation with New York Times reporter Jodi Kantor in June 2018 night. The mom to daughter Marlow, 1, said that hearing those words impacts your self-esteem for life. \"At that time, I was like 21 years old, so if you look at that and use that as an example and imagine that for over two decades, forms of that from when you\u2019re a child to all the way up, it does something to you.\"\n\n02 of 13 JENNIFER LOPEZ In an interview with InStyle, the singer opened up about the early days of her career, when people in the industry told her to lose weight. Lopez, however, wasn't fazed. \u201cThey didn\u2019t bother me at all. But I got a lot of flak for it from people in the industry. They\u2019d say, \u2018You should lose a few pounds,\u2019 or \u2018You should do this or do that.\u2019 It finally got to the point that I was like, \u2018This is who I am. I\u2019m shaped like this,\u2019 \u201d Lopez said. \u201cEverybody I grew up with looked like that, and they were all beautiful to me. I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it. I still don\u2019t!\u201d\n\n03 of 13 KARLIE KLOSS Francois G. Durand/Getty Images Not even supermodels are immune to body critics \u2014 as Kloss revealed during a candid interview. \u201cI was called both too fat and too thin by a casting agent on the same day,\u201d Kloss said at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, reported the New York Post. But Kloss says she doesn\u2019t worry about her weight, and instead focuses on her health and strength: \u201cI don\u2019t want to please anyone but myself,\u201d she said.\n\n04 of 13 MISTY COPELAND Gabriel Olsen/FilmMagic \"I didn't go through puberty until I was 19, and I was already a professional. So everyone's expecting your body, as your instrument, to look a certain way,\" the American Ballet Theatre's first-ever African-American principal dancer tells SELF. \"Being told to lose weight, and being African American, not having anyone else around who looked like me, caused me so much doubt.\" But the dancer persevered, ultimately proving that her athletic frame could fit in. \"I want to show the ballet world it's possible to do all these things and not be rail-thin or have blonde hair.\"\n\n05 of 13 ASHLEY BENSON Matt Baron/Rex USA Benson is a size 2, yet has still has been told she's too overweight for certain roles. \"It's come up a few times in the last few years, like, 'You're too fat for this,'\" she told magazine. \"I get told all the time to lose weight. I'm just sitting here like, 'Wait, what? Do you want a skeleton?'\" But Benson isn't worrying about numbers. \"I feel good,\" she said. \"I don't want to lose 20 lbs., because I don't need to. I'm a size 2, but I think that size 4 is healthy. I think that all of these sizes are healthy.\"\n\n06 of 13 ASHLEY GRAHAM Splash News Online \u201cI had agencies telling me that I had to lose weight,\u201d Graham told PEOPLE. \u201cI had one that waved money in my face and said, \u2018If you lose more \u201clb\u2019s\u201d \u2013 pounds \u2013 you can make a lot more of this,\u2019 and he was waving $20 bills in my face.\u201d \u201cThat wasn\u2019t even a motivator for me to lose weight. I was peaking at a size 18, and in the plus size fashion industry, models go from a size 8 to a size 16/18. So if you\u2019re on the smaller size or the bigger size, you\u2019re not going to work as much as if you\u2019re in the middle. So he was trying to encourage me to lose weight but it didn\u2019t work, because I was that person where if you told me to go on a diet and lose weight, I\u2019m just going to gain weight.\u201d\n\n07 of 13 KHLO\u00c9 KARDASHIAN Chris Weeks/Getty The youngest Kardashian sister has had to withstand repeated attacks on her physical appearance, especially once her family was thrust into the spotlight on Keeping Up with the Kardashians. \"Right before the show started, I thought I was in good shape, but I guess not good enough for Hollywood's eyes,\" she told PEOPLE. \"I didn't realize I was the 'fat' sister until I went on TV and the media started saying that about me.\"\n\n08 of 13 JENNIFER LAWRENCE Monica Schipper/Getty \"Somebody told me I was fat, that I was going to get fired if I didn't lose a certain amount of weight,\" she told Harper's Bazaar U.K. \"They brought in pictures of me where I was basically naked, and told me to use them as motivation for my diet.\" But if anyone can shut it down, it's J.Law. Now, \"If anybody even tries to whisper the word 'diet,' I'm like, 'You can go f--k yourself.'\"\n\n09 of 13 KOURTNEY KARDASHIAN Jason Merritt/Getty Images It's not just their agents or the media telling them to slim down \u2013 some celebs get it from their own significant others. Kardashian was body-shamed by Scott Disick just a few months after she'd given birth to their second child. In a 2013 episode of Kourtney & Kim Take Miami, she brought up how she was having a hard time losing her baby weight. Despite her eating healthily and exercising in a healthy way, Disick told her to \"lose weight faster.\" (Ummm.)\n\n10 of 13 KELLY CLARKSON Neil Mockford/Alex Huckle/GC Images After Clarkson gave birth to her adorable daughter, she faced ugly criticism on social media. But British journalist Katie Hopkins took it to the next level with cruel tweets about Clarkson's weight. She wrote, \"Jesus, what happened to Kelly Clarkson? Did she eat all of her backing singers?\" and then \"Look chubsters, Kelly Clarkson had a baby a year ago. That is no longer baby weight. That is carrot cake weight. Get over yourselves.\" For the record, Clarkson didn't let the viral criticism get to her. \"She doesn't know me. I'm awesome! It doesn't bother me. It's a free world. Say what you will. I've just never cared what people think. It's more if I'm happy and I'm confident and feeling good, that's always been my thing. And more so now, since having a family \u2013 I don't seek out any other acceptance.\"\n\n11 of 13 TYRA BANKS Paul Archuleta/FilmMagic Banks has talked openly over the years of being told she needs to meet a certain model-esque weight. In a 2007 PEOPLE interview, she recalled that her modeling agency printed out for her a list of designers with the heading, \"Will not book Tyra because of hips.\" A particularly painful moment came when, during a fitting for a show in Milan, she heard two seamstresses calling her \"grasso\" (\"fat\" in Italian). \"I was 126 lbs. at the time!\" she said. \"If some designer said it, it would hurt \u2013 but it hurt even more because maternal women were saying it.\" By age 22, her agency wanted her to lose 10 lbs. Soon it occurred to Banks that her curvy (and fierce) body would be seen as an asset in other markets. Cut to her iconic career modeling for Sports Illustrated, Victoria's Secret and much, much more.\n\n12 of 13 AMBER RILEY Michael Tran/Filmmagic In a 2012 interview for MTV's This Is How I Made It, the Glee alum got emotional discussing all of the body-shaming (disguised as constructive criticism) she faced as she tried to break into the industry. \"Going to the auditions and hearing the casting director say, 'You need to lose a little weight,' I didn't understand why people couldn't accept me for who I was,\" Riley said. \"I'm not gonna conform and hurt myself and do something crazy to be a size 2.\"", "images":
