The programme aims to recognize the work of exceptional young people and the work that they do within the Commonwealth nations.\n\nTaking on his new job in April 2018, Prince Harry said (via The Daily Mail), \"In my new role I will work to support The Queen, my father The Prince of Wales, and my brother William, all of whom know that young people are the answer to the challenges of today.\"\n\nAt the time, he made it clear that he wanted Meghan to join him, saying, \"I am also incredibly grateful that the woman I am about to marry, Meghan, will be joining me in this work, of which she too is hugely excited to take part in.\"", "images": ["http://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.6416a85.svg?primary=%2523ffffff",
