The Weeknd goes on to sing about a relationship, and then seems to point out that he still has feelings for this person.\n\n\u201cYou gave me comfort / But falling for you was my mistake / I put you on top, I put you on top / I claimed you so proud and openly / And when times were rough, when times were rough / I made sure I held you close to me\u2026 I said I didn\u2019t feel nothing, baby, but I lied,\u201d the lyrics say.\n\nSelena and The Weeknd split in October 2017, after they first got together around January of that year.
