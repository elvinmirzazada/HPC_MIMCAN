While the singer used to have basically every popular beauty by her side, including the Hadid sisters, Lily Aldridge, and Serena Williams, she's been riding solo lately, basically since her split from Tom Hiddleston.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBut Karlie Kloss came to the rescue to wish happy birthday to the singer with a cute selfie snap. T-Swift is now 28-years-old.\n\nSource: BACKGRID\n\nWhile Taylor already was losing friends, according to reports, one of her latest singles, \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" didn't help matters at all, as she called out Kanye West, Katy Perry, and others, reportedly leaving a former friend, Kendall Jenner, furious.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: BACKGRID\n\n\u201cSince Taylor\u2019s been in hiding Kendall\u2019s very much the queen bee these days, so what she says goes for the majority of that group. She\u2019s made it clear that anyone listening or supporting Taylor will be banned from her circle instantly, and the likes of Gigi, Bella and Cara are all doing as they\u2019re told,\" a source said.\n\nSource: BACKGRID\n\nGuess it doesn't always pay off to stay off of social media!\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: BACKGRID\n\nBut at least Karlie still is backing Taylor, even if everyone else is remaining silent on her birthday.
