Rumor has it, the \"La La Land\" actor and the \"2 Fast 2 Furious\" actress have been living separate lives for months following the arrival of their second daughter last year.\n\n\"They're past the point of caring now. The biggest sign it's over is the fact that Eva and Ryan don't even bother to argue anymore. The only thing they do agree on is the fact that none of their needs are being met!\" says the source.\n\nAccording to a source, Ryan and Eva's relationship broke up after he chose to celebrate Mother's Day with his mom, Donna, rather than Eva. Their relationship has reportedly been toxic behind closed doors for quite a long time now.\n\nRyan was devastated when Eva refused to accompany him to the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, despite his Best Actor nods for \"La La Land\", according to sources.\n\nThe source claims, \"Everyone's kind of gotten used to Eva shunning the limelight, but no one ever thought for a moment she'd skip the Oscars - especially when Ryan was nominated for a once-in-a-lifetime accolade. It didn't make sense. When they first got together, they were inseparable and were often seen out on dates holding hands. Now that just doesn't happen.\"\n\nEva reportedly refused to accompany Ryan on the annual award shows as she was jealous with his co-star Emma Stone. \"Emma and Ryan have THE hottest chemistry in Hollywood right now. Eva seems to feel totally intimidated by Emma, even though neither Emma nor Ryan have given her any reason to worry,\" shares the source.\n\n\"Since Eva bowed out of the public eye, she's like a paranoid hermit, and it's driven a huge wedge between them,\" the source tells Radar Online, \"She'll go weeks without speaking to any other adult except Ryan. It makes for a pretty intense situation. Eva won't go out, and she avoids his family. Even worse, she's convinced she's not Ryan's only one - when she is!\"\n\nThe source adds, \"Ryan's not a cheating kind of guy and can't stand it when women hit on him. Even worse, he can't stand being accused of something he hasn\u2019t done!\"\n\nYou can share this post!", "images": ["http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/27/00215683.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x400/2023/11/27/00215656.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/28/00215691.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/assets/img/logo.png", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/11/29/00215773e1.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/27/00215661.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-are-splitting.jpg", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/27/00215658.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-are-splitting.jpg", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/11/29/00215770.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2023/07/27/00209189.jpg", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2023/08/07/00209765.jpg", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/28/00215702.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2023/08/07/00209775.jpg", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/27/00215678.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/27/00215674.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2023/08/01/00209471.jpg", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/11/29/00215759.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/11/29/00215771.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/27/00215682.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/11/29/00215772.webp", "http://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/11/29/00215758.webp"], "top_img": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-are-splitting.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aceshowbiz Team"], "canonical_link": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00109988.html", "title": "Report: Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Rumor has it, the 'La La Land' actor and his baby mama have been living separate lives for months.", "author": "AceShowbiz Team", "fb": {"app_id": 320088948016615}, "og": {"title": "Report: Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes Split", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00109988.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-are-splitting.jpg", "alt": "Report: Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes Split"}, "site_name": "AceShowbiz", "description": "Rumor has it, the 'La La Land' actor and his baby mama have been living separate lives for months."}, "twitter": {"title": "Report: Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes Split", "description": "Rumor has it, the 'La La Land' actor and his baby mama have been living separate lives for months.", "image": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/ryan-gosling-and-eva-mendes-are-splitting.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@aceshowbiz", "creator": "@aceshowbiz", "domain": "aceshowbiz.com"}, "googlebot-news": "index,follow", "googlebot": "index,follow", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "language": "en", "geo.country": "US", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "theme-color": "#5F256F", "facebook-domain-verification": "w1cnp2fiw07juij7ioh13nr1t76oqf"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.aceshowbiz.com", "summary": ""}
