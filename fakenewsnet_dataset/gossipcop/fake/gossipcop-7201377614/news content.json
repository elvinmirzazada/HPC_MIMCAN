The first teaser trailer debuted at Comic-Con last week (where we spotted some of the best-dressed celebrities) and the film is expected to debut this November.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the Oscar-winning actress, then you\u2019ll be even more excited to know that the star will be reunited with her My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding co-star, Dermot Mulroney, for the upcoming series.\n\nWhilst we still have a few months to wait for Season 1 of Homecoming (which will make its debut on November 2nd, 2018, on Amazon Video), take a look at the new cast of Charlie\u2019s Angels in the meantime.", "images": ["https://buro247.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/imagesJulia-Roberts-x-small-screen-x-article-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://buro247.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/imagesJulia-Roberts-x-small-screen-x-article-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://buro247.me/culture/films-and-theatre/julia-roberts-is-the-latest-hollywood-heavyweight/", "title": "Julia Roberts is the latest Hollywood heavyweight to move to the small screen", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "It seems that 2018 is the year for some of Hollywood's biggest names to make a switch to the small screen.
