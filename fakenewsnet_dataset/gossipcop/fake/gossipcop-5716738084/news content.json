wrote on Twitter.\n\nDespite there being no suggestion that Lawrence had any involvement in the split, another wrote: \"Jennifer Lawrence broke up Chris Pratt's marriage\".\n\n__________________________\n\nREAD MORE\n\nChris Pratt and Anna Faris announce separation\n\nShowbiz relationship splits we didn't see coming\n\nFilm review: Morten Tyldum\u2019s sci-fi
