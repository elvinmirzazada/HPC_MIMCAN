I can\u2019t deal in hypotheticals and have no idea what any Trump aids hope happens. Of course, real question is if they danced, who would lead?\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Assault\n\nMeanwhile, a source close to the star told PEOPLE on Wednesday that Jenner, who has been an advocate of nondiscrimination legislation, sees the event as an \u201can opportunity to represent and defend the LGBTQ community within the party.\u201d\n\nJenner was not invited by Trump but will be a guest of the American Unity Fund, a non-profit conservative organization dedicated to advancing the cause of freedom and equal opportunity for LGBTQ Americans.\n\n\u201cCaitlyn sees this as a chance to bring attention to LGBTQ causes and she is committed to protecting human rights no matter the political party in power,\u201d said the insider. \u201cShe has no problem speaking out if Republicans fail to protect equal rights.\u201d", "images":
