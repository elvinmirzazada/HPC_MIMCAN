So congratulations, Julianne.\u201d\n\nSeacrest, whose two-year relationship with Hough ended in 2013, said of the scenic wedding destination: \u201cI\u2019ve been on that lake. I\u2019ve seen that lake. We dated years ago and remain friends.\u201d\n\nWhen his co-host Kelly Ripa asked if he was having mixed feelings about hearing about an ex\u2019s big day, Seacrest \u2014 who recently moved in with girlfriend Shayna Taylor \u2014 said, \u201cNo. I\u2019ve got several exes who have gotten married. They\u2019re all married. Then they start having kids.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Ryan Seacrest is Already a Fixture in Kelly Ripa\u2019s House\n\nFor her part, Hough, 29, was over the moon with how her special day turned out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I ever really necessarily dreamed about my wedding as a kid,\u201d Hough, tells PEOPLE exclusively. \u201cBut I know I will always cherish and remember it for the rest of my life.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/PJcqrMNJ3VWfoBfPgSs5ykLHnZA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(629x149:631x151)/Jason-Oppenheim-Marie-Lou-Nurk-8-051923--8b9c55d961964caf97b013bfb5c4ccf6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tTG5EVOefOCr8puPE00Owlq5jCo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x479:981x481)/julianne-hough-dating-history-split-d3d3b805cbc94d28a615e6021323b7c9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zEe8jFednJDNFNEvixuo7F6sfmM=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dana-Rose-Falcone_WebReady_02-cedae131ab8d4905921e9154611fa210.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/WQCBwCCTQGbIwPHxNiuZDyRdIUA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/kelly-ripa-6-041123-839397d137cf473984509dcfc1877e0f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/fUpYKB3SINTaBEetZ-oY35nQ0Qo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Brooks-Laich-split-with-Julianne-Hough-98db156d0cdb4294a7386d46da2532fb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/GYBSKgvteiDjznIyiSeECEvYDw8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kelly-ripa-mark-conseulos-amy-robach-tj-holmes-040723-1-78f3ef6e042f40caa9b601b101a2d337.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rY3oec7p81qesEw3BhKiUaZnxdo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/julianne-hough-d05066077f12459a8d534fb4788bc306.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/GHU1RFk_CLc7PeTV7mHRdY_Ry44=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(683x0:685x2)/ryan-seacrest-01bbc8658285430a8402069a5cb35bb1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/MxtA2nigy95mQhRI4ko0Rf4Y8o4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/live-with-kelly-ryan-021623-2-ae55a8aa27554af1a3fc25fab3178340.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2CKElUNnJdZhGNLu016kYgLD8t0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/Julianne-Hough-Ryan-Seacrest-79b700ee70d8422ca6ae2414836454d9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/UoRYyHFyZWoYRSfxe_w0jvwWj4Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x524:1021x526)/ryan-seacrest-aubrey-paige-tout-f37b30858011411e99b464966cd23ac8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zVUTQHoh_9PtwrbalqkLkrYdPlY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x284:981x286)/kelly-ripa-mark-consuelos-1-0521d2acd54c4bc4ae72a876a0024c1e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/J8oMxj946kA1Ajxy3A2_CjKPN_c=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kelly-ripa-ryan-seacrest-live-with-ryan-and-kelly-041423-1a-047971e4c9cd46ecab51a2cdf8978978.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/KTdGEvJlCr7D1jADCFRPot-0J2A=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/kelly-ripa-1-041123-4ec844aea6b74d4dad1af78cc4142c19.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Sf59jImL_fFPkfNtj6c1F39eCJE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x129:736x131)/kelly-ripa-mark-consuelos-nyc-home-050923-058d4710a4824c59b0d7fdfe9c40c0e6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Dj_fdQCnNj21GVtU_9gp3yY5N-8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x19:706x21)/kelly-ripa-mark-ryan-seacrest-oscars-031223-4347fd88f2364cd0af89f44dda095998.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/GHU1RFk_CLc7PeTV7mHRdY_Ry44=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(683x0:685x2)/ryan-seacrest-01bbc8658285430a8402069a5cb35bb1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dana Rose Falcone", "Dana Rose Falcone Is A Staff Writer Covering Tv At People.
