Obviously, Brown went with ABC's Black-ish, on which he and Martin play twins. Now, the pair are breaking into film, with Brown starring in indie Emmett alongside Rita Wilson ?as Martin drives a new project ?of her own. After firing the agent who suggested she \"just chill and take a break\" during a hiatus, the executive producer of 2019's Little conceived the film, a ?twist on Tom Hanks' iconic comedy Big, and even convinced ?Issa Rae to star alongside her in the Universal feature.\n\nBROWN\n\nTHE SHOW OR MOVIE THAT MADE ME WANT TO ACT Space Jam\n\nI'D LOVE TO STAR IN A REMAKE OF \u2026 \"Space Jam. I know you're doing it, LeBron!\" LAST SHOW I BINGED \"When Stranger Things season two came out I literally watched the whole season while my dad was shopping at some suit store. We were there for a long time!\" MY HERO \"LeBron. He's ?a good example of anything can happen, anything is possible.\"\n\nHOW I SPENT MY FIRST PAYCHECK \"It just went straight to my college savings.\"\n\nWHEN I GROW UP, I WANT TO \u2026 \"Be an NBA player.\"\n\nMY GENERATION, IN A FEW WORDS, IS \u2026 \"Passionate, because I feel like we've taken a lot of action for a lot of things that are going on right now. And I feel like a lot of the protests are kids from my generation, and I feel like that doesn't happen that often when you have kids who are trying to make things happen more than the adults are.\"\n\nI'M JEALOUS OF REGULAR KIDS WHEN \u2026 \"I see that they're just chillin' every day and coming home from school playing Fortnite. I'm like, 'Oh my God, you guys are already level 100 on this game that I can't play because I'm busy doing a TV show.'\"\n\nMARTIN\n\nI WAS MOST STARSTRUCK BY \u2026 \"Beyonce and President Obama, and I met them at the same time \u2014 the White House Easter Egg Roll \u2014 which was very overwhelming!\"\n\nMY HERO \"My mom because she is the definition of black girl magic.\"\n\nHOW I SPENT MY FIRST PAYCHECK \"I went to the Gucci store.\"\n\nWHEN I GROW UP, I WANT TO \u2026 \"Inspire more girls to believe in themselves and create their own stuff at any age.\"\n\nMY GENERATION, IN A FEW WORDS, IS \u2026 \"Fearless. We just want to inspire young kids like us that they can do anything.\"\n\nI'M JEALOUS OF REGULAR KIDS WHEN \u2026 \"They get to walk around and no one recognizes them.\"", "images":
