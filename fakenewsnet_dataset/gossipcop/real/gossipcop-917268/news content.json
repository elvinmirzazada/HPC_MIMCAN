There\u2019s something missing and I want to give you a housewarming gift so it\u2019s gonna go on that shelf,\u201d DeGeneres said before whipping out a shiny new Crock-Pot with a big red bow.\n\n\u201cI will remember to unplug this after I\u2019m done using it,\u201d Moore added with a laugh, referencing the kitchen appliance that played a part in the demise of her TV husband played by Milo Ventimiglia.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Mandy Moore on Working With Milo Ventimiglia on \u2018This Is Us\u2019: \u201cIt\u2019s Easy to Pretend to Be in Love With Him\u201d\n\nThe episode resulted in many devastated fans turning their backs on their Crock-Pots. To make good with the brand, This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman and Ventimiglia created a hilarious Super Bowl ad with the hashtag #CrockPotIsInnocent. Ventimiglia also stopped by DeGeneres\u2019 show to come to the tool\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cI think there was a lot of misdirected hate at a Crock-Pot as opposed to a faulty slow cooker from the past,\u201d he said in February. \u201cThe good news is it didn\u2019t slowly cook Jack.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/Na0ccaVhaP1J97k6lQUzCATBGP0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/drag-race-tout-1-ddb3fddbba48423186b7040080ec9602.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/nAqjqvImNMQiM2DF82peRIqdH04=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(599x0:601x2)/mandy-moore-20455a4f67094f00847f203aa329d2be.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qq03P1NZ5enanr5CjKeKih4sagk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/tout-whoopi-goldberg-anne-hathaway-ellen-degeneres-fd6f282a4c9548e6b459e83eab3458c8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qAKZNVD-MyYT2Zhweo1Yv3Hc324=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1059x700:1061x702)/howard-beth-stern-tout-ca197ffc55fb4f07888393d64ca898b8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/o50mJxel_ZgFgiphG-6hiwmr6cA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/luke-ressert-1-041923-4ea66e3e922a45f3b08266c52739f0a0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/L4L_2ZR46yeidQRHfwsVajcKzOk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2999x0:3001x2)/8-best-rice-cookers-of-2023-social-05dcbb24b2c6477f9e42266e2669d56d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rbgrK2Lp_Q9caoGLzPwQ4tvJa8Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/mandy-moore1-c54ac1e75c46418aa2e3d76982565258.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/VvrL8kFdYn16ly5HavDGQCstKfs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(899x548:901x550)/ellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi-1-9e26f7fde02944e3840b7a63133111e4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/DXAZ4SnFAX6l8337LZoeUAkIn3s=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x449:981x451)/kevin-hart-family-e3cdf49c3f2f4286998e04b6ba22e17c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/h6l9_BFIlakaoyMsQR_AXIK-pBY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(809x349:811x351)/Mandy-Moore-and-Taylor-Goldsmith-fd8481247d574a388130f32c33c5969e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-_Xf0KYyX-FwqFzHHLAG__r8894=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x404:981x406)/martha-stewart-snoop-dogg-1-5d445052b93f49a998c3a1050e5a9e9b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/EFIi9OiOz8UUF-_V4WUK2pEgD-k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(441x10:443x12)/kylie-jenner-pizza-050323-deec0fb6fdf04ab99c23ca8ed532d74f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/DNzgs8UWGLd7KILctpUmLI3EXm4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x259:721x261)/this-is-us-cast-1-67fd2c82ecef4596b3d47cda357f124b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hbVKySzoiZvEzxp7JOqj1UdMQ8M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x49:751x51)/taylor-swift-joe-jonas-111822-1-e314dbdc7a724b6da4cf1c41757a1a12.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lszJIdJHqle37561hKmLkhFYPdU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x425:1001x427)/super-mario-bros-cast-f540b4096a214648b1da4b32104b19c3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hXObydIK-iLlot2pJLfvh0pXO9s=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x299:1021x301)/THIS-IS-US-001-9240960475ef4fceb34b44e02b7bcca7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hmHoRNH-0dD6JVhDEUBOlB0UPdI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/carol-burnett-julie-andrews-carol-burnett-90-years-of-laughter-love-030323-2-d5f9889f10b04f2a98aaee2656001149.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/rbgrK2Lp_Q9caoGLzPwQ4tvJa8Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/mandy-moore1-c54ac1e75c46418aa2e3d76982565258.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Staff Editor For Human Interest S Digital Vertical At People.
