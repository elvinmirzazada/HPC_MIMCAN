Colbert took a little longer to finish.\n\n\"That was good,\" Brady said with a big smile. \"That was really good!\"\n\nThe five-time Super Bowl champion stopped by to promote his new book, \"The TB12 Method,\" in which he discusses nutrition and explains how to achieve a lifetime of sustained peak performance, according to his website.\n\nNew England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady walks off the field after the Patriots lost Super Bowl 52 against the Philadelphia Eagles, Feb. 4, 2018, in Minneapolis.\n\nThe quarterback said his diet consists of lots of fruits and vegetables, but he\u2019d never eaten a strawberry.\n\n\"Oh, man, I hate strawberries,\" Brady, 40, said. \"I just hate the smell.\"\n\nColbert, in utter disbelief, went on to present him with a bowl full of bright red strawberries and another challenge.\n\nBrady, a true competitor at heart, eventually accepted the challenge to taste one, although it took some convincing.\n\n\"Not that bad,\" Brady said as he placed the half-eaten fruit back into the bowl. \"I did it. Mom, are you proud of me?\"", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/george-santos-nc-jt-231128_1701208469329_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/jimmy-carter-4-rt-bb-232811_1701198112004_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Sports/super-bowl-betting-01-gty-jrl-180130_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/pence-trump3-file-gty-ml-231127_1701110318739_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/tom-brady-01-ap-jc-180311.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/victim1a-ht-ml-231128_1701184046987_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/images/hulu.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/rockefeller-tree-ap-jef-231128_1701183464711_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Sports/super-bowl-betting-01-gty-jrl-180130_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tom-brady-eats-1st-strawberry-chugs-beer-stephen/story?id=53701793", "title": "Tom Brady eats his 1st strawberry and chugs a beer with Stephen Colbert", "meta_data": {"description": "Colbert convinced Brady to eat a strawberry for the first time in his life.", "keywords": "Tom Brady, chugs beer, thumb injury, Article, 53701793", "copyright": "2023 ABC News", "author": "ABC News", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Tom Brady eats his 1st strawberry and chugs a beer with Stephen Colbert", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tom-brady-eats-1st-strawberry-chugs-beer-stephen/story?id=53701793", "title": "Tom Brady eats his 1st strawberry and chugs a beer with Stephen Colbert", "description": "Colbert convinced Brady to eat a strawberry for the first time in his life.", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Sports/super-bowl-betting-01-gty-jrl-180130_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2018-03-13T11:07:22Z", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,53701793", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,53701793", "googleplay": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tom-brady-eats-1st-strawberry-chugs-beer-stephen/story?id=53701793"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "ABC News", "title": "Tom Brady eats his 1st strawberry and chugs a beer with Stephen Colbert", "description": "Colbert convinced Brady to eat a strawberry for the first time in his life.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tom-brady-eats-1st-strawberry-chugs-beer-stephen/story?id=53701793", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Sports/super-bowl-betting-01-gty-jrl-180130_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,53701793", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,53701793", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for ipad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tom-brady-eats-1st-strawberry-chugs-beer-stephen/story?id=53701793", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tom-brady-eats-1st-strawberry-chugs-beer-stephen/story?id=53701793"}}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
