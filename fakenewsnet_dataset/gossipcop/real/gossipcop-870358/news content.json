{"url": "https://stylecaster.com/bathing-suits-on-sale/", "text": "While it may be true that most swimsuit shopping happens in June when we\u2019re all still enthusiastically making beach plans, we may or may not keep and aren\u2019t totally put off by the prospect of a heat wave, there\u2019s something to be said for waiting until August to stock up on swimwear.\n\nEnd-of-season sales are still on, discounts are deep, and those bathing suits that a few months ago seemed awfully expensive for just a few skimpy bits of nylon are now actually quite reasonably priced\u2014and at certain retailers, downright cheap.\n\nBecause the selection has been picked over, you\u2019ve got to be strategic: use the site\u2019s filters to narrow down what you see to only the suits available in your size, otherwise you\u2019re setting yourself up for disappointment\u2014especially if you happen to wear something other than an XS or XL. Stores with copious swimwear offerings each season\u2014think ASOS, J.Crew, and any major department store\u2014are going to have both the deepest discounts and the greatest chance of finding something that fits you within your desired price range.\n\nAlso, don\u2019t be put off if only the top or bottom of a suit is available in your size\u2014think of it as an opportunity to mix and match (some of my favorite bikinis were never actually meant to be pairs). And if you\u2019ve been coveting a piece from an It-brand like Lisa Marie Fernandez, Solid and Striped, or Marysia but can\u2019t imagine shelling out more than $300 for a swimsuit, now\u2019s the time to do a little hunting\u2014you may get lucky and find one for 70 percent off.\n\nAhead, find 31 bathing suit bargains to snag before summer\u2019s up.", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetabercrombiejeans.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-clothing-sales-right-now-2.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Pickleball-Gifts.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/irrational-found-renewed-season-2-nbc.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/swim-on-sale-aerie-feat1.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/khyreview.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Taylor-Swift.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/alo-yoga-black-friday-sale.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetsweaterset.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hgp-headshot.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/daisy-jones-and-the-six.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RemiBader_Homepage.webp?w=244", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rosamund-Pike-Saltburn.png?resize=232,175", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&resize=232,175", "https://spy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sdfgve.png?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/swim-on-sale-aerie-feat1.jpg", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ElonMusk-1.jpeg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uggdupestarget.gif?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/target-sweater.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lush-advent-cal.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/best-womens-winter-boots.png?w=960&h=580&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/olivercabellsneakersale.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cariuma-oca-therma-black.png?w=960&h=580&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bestprodsforthinninghair.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/holidaydresses.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/swim-on-sale-aerie-feat1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hilary George-Parkin"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/fashion/shopping-guides/620634/bathing-suits-on-sale/", "title": "Why You Should Be Buying a Bathing Suit Right Now (Even If Summer\u2019s Almost Over)", "meta_data": {"description": "The end of summer may seem like an odd time to think about buying a swimsuit, but hear us out: Bathing suits are on sale right now\u2014like, really, really on sale\u2014and there's still plenty of time to get some use out of them.
