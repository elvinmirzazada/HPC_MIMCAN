(On the back the phrase \u201cHolidayonc\u00e9\u201d is screenprinted!) Of course, fans will remember this was one of the hidden clues she gave months before she publicly announced she was pregnant with twins Rumi and Sir Carter.\n\nOther sweaters include a $45 bright red sweater printed with the lyrics of Beyonc\u00e9 and husband JAY-Z\u2019s lyrics \u2014 \u201cShinin\u2019 Shinin\u2019 Shinin\u2019 Shinin\u2019\u201d \u2014 and a \u201cSis the Season\u201d black sweater for $40.\n\nBeyonce.com\n\nBeyonce.com\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jay-Z & Beyonce: All the Ways J and Bey Get Paid\n\nThe 22-time Grammy winner also has your Christmas tree in mind.\n\nThere\u2019s even satin ornaments to match any collection piece, including \u201cYonc\u00e9\u201d and \u201cSlay Bells\u201d satin ball ornaments and a bee enamel ornament (each for $12).", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/http://people.com/img/sign-up-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-2-2000a.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/article-covers/3313_106804645_2016_05_02_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-1-2000.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/1_1-2.jpg?w=733", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/holidayonce-3.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/http://timeinc.brightcove.com.edgesuite.net/rtmp_uds/1543367584/201704/3836/1543367584_5385203235001_5385197601001-th.jpg?pubId=416418724&videoId=5385181230001", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-1-2000.jpg?crop=104px%2C221px%2C1739px%2C913px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-3-2000a.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-4-2000.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/holidayonce-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-holiday.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-1-2000.jpg?w=1972"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-1-2000.jpg?crop=104px%2C221px%2C1739px%2C913px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126231750/http://people.com/style/beyonce-happy-thiccsgiving-sweatshirt/", "title": "Who Needs Thanksgiving?
