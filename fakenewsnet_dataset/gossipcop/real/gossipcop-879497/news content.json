That is separate from his wife, actress Carey Mulligan, who has a net worth of $12 million.\n\nMarcus Mumford is best known for being the lead singer, guitarist, and drummer for the folk rock band Mumford & Sons. The band has released the studio albums \"Sigh No More\" (2009), \"Babel\" (2012), \"Wilder Mind\" (2015), and \"Delta\" (2018) and are known for singles such as \"Little Lion Man,\" \"The Cave,\" \"Roll Away Your Stone,\" \"I Will Wait,\" and \"Believe.\" As a solo artist, Marcus has released the 2022 album \"Self-Titled\" and he earned a Primetime Emmy nomination for composing the theme music for the Apple TV+ series \"Ted Lasso\" (shared with Tom Howe, who he also scores the series with). Mumford is married to actress Carey Mulligan.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMarcus Mumford was born Marcus Oliver Johnstone Mumford on January 31, 1987, in Yorba Linda, California. His parents, Eleanor and John, are English, and they are national directors of the Vineyard Churches, an evangelical Christian denomination. Since his birth, Marcus has held both U.S. and U.K. citizenship, and the family returned to the U.K. when Mumford was a baby. Marcus has an older brother named James.\n\nMumford grew up in Wimbledon Chase, southwest London, and he attended King's College School, where he met his future Mumford & Sons bandmate Ben Lovett. After a year at the University of Edinburgh, Marcus moved back to London to focus on a career in music. In a 2022 interview with \"GQ\" magazine, Mumford revealed that he had been sexually abused during his childhood and that he wrote the song \"Cannibal\" about it, stating, \"Like lots of people \u2013 and I'm learning more and more about this as we go and as I play it to people \u2013 I was sexually abused as a child. Not by family and not in the church, which might be some people's assumption. But I hadn't told anyone about it for 30 years.\"\n\nCareer\n\nMarcus' music career began as a drummer for Laura Marling on tour alongside other future members of Mumford & Sons. In 2007, he formed the band with Ben Lovett, Ted Dwane, and Winston Marshall, and they released the EPs \"Mumford & Sons\" and \"Love Your Ground\" the following year. The band released its debut album, \"Sigh No More,\" on October 2, 2009, and it reached #1 on the charts in Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand as well as the U.S. \"Billboard\" Folk Albums, Independent Albums, Top Alternative Albums, Top Rock Albums, and Top Tastemaker Albums charts. The album was certified 6\u00d7 Platinum in the U.K., 4\u00d7 Platinum in Australia, and 3\u00d7 Platinum in the U.S., and the singles \"Little Lion Man,\" \"The Cave,\" and \"Roll Away Your Stone\" went Platinum or higher in several countries. \"Little Lion Man\" and \"The Cave\" each earned a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Song, and \"The Cave\" was also nominated for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Rock Performance.\n\nMumford & Sons released their second album, \"Babel,\" in September 2012, and it reached #1 on the charts in eight countries and went 5\u00d7 Platinum in Canada, 4\u00d7 Platinum in the U.K., and 3\u00d7 Platinum in Australia. \"Babel\" won a Grammy for Album of the Year, and the single \"I Will Wait\" was nominated for Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song.

In 2014, he performed on the album \"Lost on the River: The New Basement Tapes,\" which also featured artists such as Elvis Costello, T Bone Burnett, and Rhiannon Giddens. Mumford co-wrote several of the album's tracks as well. The third Mumford & Sons album, Wilder Mind, was released in May 2015, and it reached the top 10 on the charts in 17 countries. The album went Platinum in five countries, and it featured the Gold single \"Believe.\" In November 2018, the band released album #4, \"Delta,\" which topped the charts in four countries and was certified Gold in Canada and the U.K.\n\nThe band appeared in the 2012 documentary \"Big Easy Express,\" which won a Grammy for Best Music Film, and 2013's \"Mumford & Sons: The Road to Red Rocks\" was also nominated in that category. Marcus released the solo album \"Self-Titled\" in September 2022, and it reached #4 in the U.K. His music video for the single \"Cannibal\" was directed by none other than Steven Spielberg. \"Cannibal\" was the Oscar-winning director's first music video, and it was filmed on his phone in one take. Mumford also produced the 2015 Christian Letts album \"Hold Fast\" and co-wrote four of the tracks, and he produced the 2016 King Charles album \"Gamble for a Rose.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAs a child, Marcus was pen pals with a girl named Carey Mulligan. Carey would grow up to become an Oscar-nominated actress known for films such as \"An Education,\" \"Never Let Me Go,\" and \"Promising Young Woman,\" and after she and Marcus worked together on the film \"Inside Llewyn Davis,\" they married on April 21, 2012. The ceremony was officiated by Mumford's father, and guests included Jake Gyllenhaal, Sienna Miller, and Colin Firth. The couple welcomed daughter Evelyn in September 2015, son Wilfred in August 2017 and a third child in October 2023.
