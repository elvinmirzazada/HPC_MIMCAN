When she did arrive, joining the students gathered around his impromptu memorial, it was more shocking than a slushie facial.\n\n\"Before Finn, I used to sing alone,\" she told the glee club before delivering the episode's most poignant performance, Bob Dylan's \"Make You Feel My Love.\"\n\nNothing was more gut-wrenching than when she told Matthew Morrison's Mr. Schue, \"He was my person.\"\n\nThen she handed him a plaque she'd had made, featuring a picture and quote from her \"untraditionally smart\" boyfriend that read, \"The show must go on. All over the place ... or something like that.\"\n\nAnd \"Glee\" did just that with its tribute, deftly balancing heartache with humor and respect, from its opening number (the black-clad cast singing \"Seasons of Love\" from Broadway's \"Rent\") to the closing scene: Will Schuester sobbing in Emma's (Jayma Mays) arms.\n\nMr. Schue urged the glee clubbers early in the show to memorialize Finn \"the only way we know how \u2014 by singing.\"\n\nThose performances included Mercedes' (Amber Riley) rendition of The Pretenders' \"I'll Stand By You,\" after thanking the sports stud for being the\"first cool kid to be nice to us.\" Sam (Chord Overstreet) and Artie (Kevin McHale) did a duet of James Taylor's \"Fire & Rain,\" Puck (Mark Salling) strummed his guitar along to Bruce Springsteen's \"No Surrender.\"\n\nAnd Santana (Naya Rivera) sang most of The Band Perry's \"If I Die Young\" \u2014 before fleeing the classroom, crying and screaming.\n\nShe also lashed out at Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), calling the new principal (!) a \"cold-hearted b----\" before shoving her into a cabinet.\n\nSue was characteristically callous about Finn's death \u2014 at first. \"I'm grieving. And I grieve by insulting those who mean the most to me,\" she explained.\n\nShe also ridiculed the students' memorials, saying, \"We honor Finn Hudson by ... not making a self-serving spectacle of our own sadness.\"\n\nKurt's memorial \u2014 planting a tree \u2014 was vandalized by Puck, who was also accused of swiping Finn's letterman jacket. (One of the episode's biggest tearjerkers was Kurt saying that Finn walking down his hallway in that jacket \"was like Superman had arrived.\u201d)\n\nOf course, the actual culprit was Mr. Schue, who, until the last scene of the episode, hadn't shed a tear since finding out about Finn's death.\n\nBut he made up for it in the end, weeping as he clutched Finn's jacket, the symbol of a shining star that dimmed much too soon.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957im_/http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/tdy_take_concerts_160304.today-vid-post-small-desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957im_/http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/tdy_or_monteith_131011.today-inline-vid-featured-desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957im_/http://c.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957im_/http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/streams/2013/October/131011/8C9348299-131010-ent-finn-hmed.today-inline-med.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957im_/http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/streams/2013/October/131011/8C9348299-131010-ent-finn-hmed.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957im_/http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/tdy_or_simmons_160314__151414.today-vid-post-small-desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957im_/http://nodeassets.today.com/img/svg/641a740d.video-play-white.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957im_/http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/tdy_or_theater_160311__751504.today-vid-post-small-desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957im_/http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/tdy_or_nancy_160307__505853.today-vid-post-small-desktop.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957im_/http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/streams/2013/October/131011/8C9348299-131010-ent-finn-hmed.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Drusilla Moorhouse", "Today Contributor"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957/http://www.today.com/popculture/glee-says-goodbye-finn-without-revealing-how-he-died-8C11375428", "title": "'Glee' says goodbye to Finn without revealing how he died", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width initial-scale=1 maximum-scale=1 user-scalable=no", "msvalidate.01": "43434ADDF3F60D7897F819F388E2FADF", "author": "Drusilla Moorhouse", "og": {"description": "RIP, Finn Hudson. \"Glee\" mourned the death of the beloved jock played by Cory Monteith, who died July 13, on its third episode of the season Thursday.The details of the 31-year-old actor's fatal overdose of heroin and alcohol have been reported extensively, but Finn's cause of death wasn't revealed to viewers.", "title": "'Glee' says goodbye to Finn without revealing how he died", "site_name": "TODAY.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957im_/http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/streams/2013/October/131011/8C9348299-131010-ent-finn-hmed.jpg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003957/http://www.today.com/popculture/glee-says-goodbye-finn-without-revealing-how-he-died-8C11375428"}, "description": "RIP, Finn Hudson. \"Glee\" mourned the death of the beloved jock played by Cory Monteith, who died July 13, on its third episode of the season Thursday.The details of the 31-year-old actor's fatal overdose of heroin and alcohol have been reported extensively, but Finn's cause of death wasn't revealed to viewers.", "twitter": {"title": "'Glee' says goodbye to Finn without revealing how he died", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TodayShow", "description": "RIP, Finn Hudson. \"Glee\" mourned the death of the beloved jock played by Cory Monteith, who died July 13, on its third episode of the season Thursday.The details of the 31-year-old actor's fatal overdose of heroin and alcohol have been reported extensively, but Finn's cause of death wasn't revealed to viewers.", "creator": "@TodayShow", "domain": "TODAY.com", "image": {"src": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/streams/2013/October/131011/8C9348299-131010-ent-finn-hmed.today-inline-large.jpg"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615}, "news_keywords": "Pop Culture,TV,Orange Room", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-11T03:21:00Z"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
