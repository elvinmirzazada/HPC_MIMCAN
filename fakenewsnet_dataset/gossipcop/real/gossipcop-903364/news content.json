Being pregnant, it's a whole different type of self-care,\" the Revenge Body health and fitness guru explains. \"I still exercise to maintain my sanity and also to feel good about myself, but my workouts are not as intense as they once were. I'm also eating differently because, of course I have cravings, but I want to make sure I'm supplying my baby with the proper nutrients.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm focused on being healthy mind, body and soul for myself and the baby -- but man, I can't wait to be a beast in the gym already, LOL,\" she adds. \"Still, for as active as I have been during my pregnancy, I feel great. So my new year's resolution will be to stay as healthy mentally and physically as I can!\"\n\n\n\nThe post comes following the backlash Kardashian received last month from fans shaming her for working out with a little one on the way.\n\n\n\n\"For the ones who think they are physicians all of a sudden,\" she tweeted. \"MY doctor and I communicate and my workouts are cleared and highly recommended. Thanks kiddos! Don't make me stop sharing s**t.\"\n\n\n\nKardashian revealed on Tuesday that she was \"officially six months\" pregnant, with a sweet photo of her sharing a smooch with her NBA star beau. The blond beauty donned a skintight, black House of CB dress, which gave fans a glimpse of her growing belly.\n\n\n\n\"\u2765 Mom and Dad \u2765,\" she captioned it.\n\nHear more on how the lovebirds are preparing for the arrival of their baby in the video below!\n\n\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nKhloe Kardashian Claps Back After Fans Shame Her for Working Out While Pregnant\n\nKhloe Kardashian Announces She's Pregnant With Bare Baby Bump Photo\n\n\n\nKhloe Kardashian Celebrates 6-Month Pregnancy Mark in Sexy Little Black Dress\n\n", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-01/kesha_spl1650679_002.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fset_khloe_kardashian_858853188.jpg%3Fh%3Dd078dad6&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/set_khloe_kardashian_858853188.jpg?h=d078dad6", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/set_khloe_kardashian_858853188.jpg?h=d078dad6", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-reveals-how-shes-staying-shape-while-pregnant-93454", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Reveals How She's Staying in Shape While Pregnant", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/set_khloe_kardashian_858853188.jpg?h=d078dad6", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The reality star, who is expecting her first child with Tristan Thompson, explains her baby-focused goals for 2018.", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Reveals How She's Staying in Shape While Pregnant", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-reveals-how-shes-staying-shape-while-pregnant-93454", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The reality star, who is expecting her first child with Tristan Thompson, explains her baby-focused goals for 2018.", "twitter": {"description": "The reality star, who is expecting her first child with Tristan Thompson, explains her baby-focused goals for 2018.", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Reveals How She's Staying in Shape While Pregnant", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-reveals-how-shes-staying-shape-while-pregnant-93454", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/set_khloe_kardashian_858853188.jpg?h=d078dad6", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Khloe Kardashian Reveals How She's Staying in Shape While Pregnant | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, News, Khloe Kardashian, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Tristan Thompson, Health", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 41, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
