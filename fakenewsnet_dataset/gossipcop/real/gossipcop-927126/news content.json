RHOA rookie Eva Marcille gave birth to a baby boy, Michael Todd Sterling, Jr., on Friday, April 13, she shared on Instagram.\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of Atlanta on Peacock and the Bravo App.\n\nEva's son was born at 5:59 p.m. on Friday at 7 pounds, 3 ounces and 19-and-a-half inches long, according to a post on Instagram that showed a photo of little Michael's footprints. Eva captioned the photo, \"All praises be to God!\"\n\nThe baby boy is Eva's first child with her fianc\u00e9, Michael Todd Sterling, an attorney and former candidate for mayor of Atlanta, and their child is named after Sterling. She also has a 4-year-old daughter, Marley Rae, from a previous relationship with musician Kevin McCall.\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00b1\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bd All praises be to God! A post shared by Eva Marcille (@evamarcille) on Apr 13, 2018 at 5:57pm PDT\n\nIt appears that Eva has been in the hospital since Thursday, April 12, according to photos she posted on Instagram.\n\nStill at it\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00b3 Come on Mikey\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00b0\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u00bd A post shared by Eva Marcille (@evamarcille) on Apr 13, 2018 at 11:40am PDT\n\nEva first announced the happy news of her second pregnancy during an interview with PEOPLE in November 2017. It wasn't long after that when Eva shared the news on Christmas that she and Michael Sr. had gotten engaged.\n\nEva previously opened up to The Daily Dish about her pregnancy in March, exclaiming that she was \"super, duper excited\" to welcome her baby boy. However, she wasn't so sure if she was ready to have the experience of going into labor again. \"My daughter was 31 hours in labor, like full pain, back labor, the whole nine. And for some reason, I kind of forgot about that, and now I'm remembering all of that, so there's just a little bit of anxiety. Not much, just a little bit,\" she said. \"I feel like I'm as ready as I'm gonna be. There's not much I can do. I'm just gonna bite my teeth, grin and bear it, and Dad will be there feeding me ice chips. So hopefully it'll all work out.\"\n\nRelated\n\nBut Eva said that she's really been \"a lot less antsy\" during her second pregnancy. \"The biggest thing that I learned from being pregnant with Marley and now being pregnant with Mikey is [to] stop worrying. I remember being pregnant with Marley, and every single thing I'm like, 'What is she doing in there? Was that an elbow? Was that a knee? Is she kicking? Is she trying to get out?' I didn't know what was what. I was wondering if I was drinking something and if it was too cold for her or too hot. I was thinking way too much,\" she shared. \"Now, I'm like, sit back, I eat whatever I want to. I'm like, 'It's cold, huh? Feels good doesn't it?' I just take it in stride. It's a lot different. I'm a lot less antsy.\"\n\nEva also shared that Michael Sr. was \"super excited\" to experience the birth of his son. But perhaps no one in Eva's family was looking forward to the arrival of little Mikey as much as her daughter, Marley, who has been carrying a crocheted blanket around the house as if it were her little brother. \"Marley is so excited about being a big sister,\" Eva gushed. \"We put together our fun new fancy stroller, and it's up in the house. So Marley puts the blanket in the stroller, and she goes around the house with it. And she's like, 'Mom, we'll be back. I'm taking the baby to the beach.' She goes around through the living room, through the dining room with the stroller. It's the cutest thing ever. She's, like, really ready.\"\n\nEva and Michael Sr. threw a prince-themed baby shower in Atlanta in honor of their son in March. The America's Next Top Model Cycle 3 winner also proved that she looks just as fierce pregnant during a gorgeous maternity shoot, which she shared photos from earlier this month.\n\nCheck out more Eva, below.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/Kathy-Hilton-Kyle-Richards-Mauricio-Umansky.jpg?itok=pfDsfn5Z", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/fredrik-eklund-family.jpg?itok=4MfJypy-", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_1310x530/public/2023/03/rhoa_s15-web-dynamiclead-desktop-1920x1080.jpg?itok=_DSS-wc1", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/40/423/RHOA_15_BONUS_CYNTHIA_BACKSTORY.jpg?itok=o7A2msBs", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/37/495/RHOA_15_BONUS_RILEY_BURRUSS_GROWING_UP_BRAVO__654341.jpg?itok=KN_z1_Tm", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/04/dish-eva-marcille-announcement.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/04/shannon-beador-mystery-man.jpg?itok=V6SS_43W", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/09/rhoslc-jack-barlow-lisa-barlow.jpg?itok=kpKWyMKS", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/09/winter-house-season-3-tom-schwartz_0.jpg?itok=2jF41LfT", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/04/alexia-nepola-frankie-rosello-wwhl.jpg?itok=PvjMMiiN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2019-06/brielle-kim-biermann-twins.jpg?itok=3FLPnO9w", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/407/767/180316_3685806_Eva_Marcille_Opens_Up_About_Welcoming_Her_Ba.jpg?itok=KXHBZVKQ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/07/robyn-dixon-skincare-business.jpg?itok=HYmaLIBv", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/sonja-morgan-quincy-morgan.jpg?itok=IzYkTa78", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/themes/custom/reality/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/candiace-dillard-dorothy-watts.jpg?itok=FW55_ZPt", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/Erika-Jayne.jpg?itok=Y2WJV_vf", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/mia-thornton-family.jpg?itok=EuiR7Ke7", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/dorit-kemsley-family.jpg?itok=l6gTc4NA", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/242/771/RHOA_15_BONUS_DREW_RALPH_RELATIONSHIP_TIMELINE_PT2.jpg?itok=Ggpwc1kq", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/dubrow.jpg?itok=_PwVmL0Y"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/04/dish-eva-marcille-announcement.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/the-real-housewives-of-atlanta-eva-marcille-gives-birth-to-son-photos", "title": "The Real Housewives of Atlanta's Eva Marcille Gives Birth to a Son: Photos", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1135944, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Eva Marcille Gives Birth to Her Second Child\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_tv_shows\":\"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\",\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/04\\/dish-eva-marcille-announcement.jpg?itok=g10EBsxV\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/04\\/dish-eva-marcille-announcement.jpg?itok=GG6x-j2D\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/04\\/dish-eva-marcille-announcement.jpg?itok=DHvTNk8V\",\"70x70\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/fp_scale_crop_70x70\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/04\\/dish-eva-marcille-announcement.jpg?itok=8n4mdbf0\"}}", "description": "The Real Housewives of Atlanta family just welcomed a new member.
