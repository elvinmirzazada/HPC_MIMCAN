Wisely, the movie wraps everything up with a rousing recreation of Queen stealing the show at 1985\u2019s Live Aid, providing the equivalent of a band making you forget a mediocre set by performing a dazzling encore. The end of \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d marks the first (and no doubt last) time that I was brought to tears by \u201cRadio Gaga.\u201d\n\nVery much an \u201cauthorized\u201d biopic \u2014 band members Brian May and Roger Taylor are credited as \u201cExecutive Music Producers\u201d \u2014 the film is a rather rote road-to-stardom tale: In 1970, a Heathrow baggage handler named Freddie Bulsara (Rami Malek) meets dental student Roger (Ben Hardy, \u201cOnly the Brave\u201d) and astrophysics student Brian (Gwilym Lee, \u201cMidsomer Murders\u201d) and informs them that they need to make him their lead singer. Add bassist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello, \u201cG.I. Joe: Retaliation), and Queen is born.\n\nThe group quickly gets label attention, due mainly to the vocal chops and stage presence of their lead singer, who has redubbed himself \u201cFreddie Mercury,\u201d much to the chagrin of his Parsi parents. Queen battles with EMI over the \u201cA Night at the Opera\u201d album, particularly over \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d which gives the eponymous film one of its most rapturous segments, as the band pieces together this complicated, elaborate, genre-defying pop single. (The casting of Mike Myers as BMI exec Ray Foster is amusing, given the connection between the song and \u201cWayne\u2019s World,\u201d but the movie overplays its hand by having Foster say that kids in cars will never bang their heads to the song.)\n\nIn his personal life, we see Freddie fall for Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton, \u201cSing Street\u201d), to whom he would propose, compose love songs for, and repeatedly refer to as the love of his life. But when Queen goes on the road, Freddie enjoys a series of quick and anonymous liaisons with men. Upon his return, she confronts him about the cracks in their marriage; \u201cI think I\u2019m bisexual,\u201d he finally confesses, which Mary shuts down with a firm: \u201cFreddie. You\u2019re gay.\u201d\n\nThere was concern in some quarters that the film would tamp down Mercury\u2019s homosexuality, and to its credit, it\u2019s right there on screen from the get-go. (Moments before he catches Mary\u2019s eye for the first time, he cruises a handsome young man.) And for a movie that literally opens with an HIV-positive Mercury coughing \u2014 letting us know early that subtlety will not be on the menu \u2014 the film does handle its protagonist\u2019s issues with AIDS-related complication respectfully, if fleetingly.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d also goes out of its way to create a hissable gay villain: manager Paul Prenter (Allen Leech, \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d), presented here as an old-school Devious Queen, all but twirls his \u201970s-clone mustache as he drives a wedge between Freddie and the band, leading to an unsuccessful solo career and a schism that will have to be healed in time for Live Aid, even though most biographical accounts of Queen seem to suggest that this parting and reuniting is pure fiction. (Mercury\u2019s first solo album under his own name didn\u2019t come out until 1985, the year that Live Aid took place.)\n\nThe film offers interesting glimpses into how hits like \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d and \u201cAnother One Bites the Dust\u201d came to be, while leaving out other moments that fans might want to see, from triumphs (\u201cFlash Gordon,\u201d recording \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d with David Bowie, opera-lover Mercury\u2019s duet with legendary diva Monserrat Caball\u00e9) to debacles (\u201cBody Language\u201d). Screenwriter Anthony McCarten is no stranger to biopic contrivance (he previously wrote \u201cDarkest Hour\u201d and \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d), but he outdoes himself in the third act of \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d in which disparate emotional arcs in Freddie\u2019s life are all resolved en route to Wembley for Live Aid. Here\u2019s hoping that chauffeur got a hefty tip for all that dramatic reconciliation.\n\nBut admittedly, that Live Aid sequence so thrillingly captures what is considered both a high point in live rock performance and a historical moment in Queen\u2019s career that it justifies making and seeing the movie. Malek doesn\u2019t always nail the off-stage Mercury \u2014 he struggles with the dental prosthetic he\u2019s been given to match the singer\u2019s legendary overbite, as though it had been thrust into his mouth for the first time seconds before cameras were rolling \u2014 but with a microphone in his hand and lip-synching to Mercury\u2019s vocals, Malek captures the electricity of a rock god at the height of his powers. It\u2019s a moment where everything the movie has to offer and everyone who worked on it \u2014 particularly cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel (\u201cDrive\u201d) and editor John Ottman (\u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past\u201d) \u2014 are firing on all cylinders.\n\nAs an inducement to dig into the Queen back catalog, \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d is an unqualified success. But when it tries to be a genuine biopic of a groundbreaking band and its singular lead singer, it\u2019s more like a little silhouette-o of a man.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alonso750.jpg?fit=58%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2549_TP_00054AR-1.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/emily.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/star-wars-movies.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bohemian-rhapsody-O_163_wem_1360_comp_v003_011159-2_rgb-1.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alonso750.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jw3-d30-10548-cr-rgb-1.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bohemian-rhapsody-O_163_wem_1360_comp_v003_011159-2_rgb-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bohemian-rhapsody-O_163_wem_1360_comp_v003_011159-2_rgb-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alonso Duralde", "Thewrap S Film Reviews Editor", "Has Written About Film For Movieline", "Salon", "Village Voice", "Msnbc.Com.
