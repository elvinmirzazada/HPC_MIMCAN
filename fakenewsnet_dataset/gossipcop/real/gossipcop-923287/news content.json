Burnett, with whom he also shares son James. Mark and Downey married in 2007 at their Malibu home.\n\nIn an exclusive statement to PEOPLE provided by a Burnett family spokesperson, the couple said Monday, \u201cOur family is so thankful for all the prayers over the last few days. We are relieved to have Cameron back home with us and we are so incredibly grateful for the amazing care he received at UCLA.\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s recent hospitalization comes four years after he underwent brain tumor surgery in 2014. At the time, Pastor Rick Warren tweeted and asked people to pray for the then-teenager following complications from the operation. \u201cPRAY for my friend Cameron Burnett in ICU with serious complications from brain tumor surgery.Cam is Mark Burnett\u2019s son,\u201d Warren tweeted.\n\nGabriel Olsen/WireImage\n\nDowney first asked for prayer for her stepson\u2019s health on Friday when she wrote on Instagram, \u201cDear friends, I need your prayers please for someone I love who is ill tonight. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f.\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s mother, Dianne, also asked for prayers over the weekend, writing on Instagram, \u201cThank you God Angels and Spirit guides for watching over my angel. #pray #heal #godspeed \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb #believe #familyfirst Life is a precious gift \ud83d\udc99.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Burnett Family\n\nShe also shared a photo of her sons with Mark on her Instagram Story Sunday, when Cameron was sitting in a hospital bed at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center.\n\nOn Saturday, Downey thanked her followers \u201cfrom the bottom of my heart for all your prayers for our son Cameron.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou all responded so fast and Mark and I are so appreciative of your kindness and prayer support,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPlease keep those prayers coming today so we can get him safely home from hospital and restored to perfect health . Thank you God for making a way . In Jesus name . Amen \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udd4a\u201d\n\nThe actress also gave an update on Sunday, with a brief message, writing, \u201cThank you for all your prayers for our family , we are so grateful \ud83d\ude4f.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Downey again shared her gratitude on Instagram: \u201cThanking God for answered prayers for our family and to everyone out there who prayed with us this week THANK YOU . We are so grateful ! We are joyfully saying prayers of thanksgiving \ud83d\udd06 #answeredprayers #thankyougod#gratefulheart #gratitude #joy #relief#prayer #countingourblessings.\u201d\n\nEarly last week, Cameron shared a photo of himself by the seaside at the Horse Guards Parade in London, England. \u201cAlways on guard \ud83d\udc51 \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7,\u201d he wrote in the caption.\n\nHe was a student at the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts and has directed short films such as The Bench. His project received Official Selections at more than 35 film festivals around the world and won at eight of those, according to his website.\n\nMark shared a photo with his son and his friend on March 17, wearing a big smile as he posed with the duo: \u201cSpot the old guy who\u2019s crashing the young Californians.\u201d\n\nBurnett has executive-produced multiple hit shows such as Shark Tank, The Apprentice, Survivor and The Voice.", "images":
