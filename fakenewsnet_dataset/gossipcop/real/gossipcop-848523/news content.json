Stern-designed 15 Central Park West for $56 million in May; now the New York Post reports that the massive pad at the headline-stealing celebrity magnet building has been sold to a mystery buyer for $50 million. The couple scooped up the 16th- and 17th-floor penthouse for $27 million in 2008 and enlisted the design pros at SheltonMindel to combine the units to create a unique home with not one but two sculptural spiral staircases and a double-sided spiral gas fireplace that was inspired by the Fibonacci spiral. The couple is reportedly buying a triplex in the latest Stern-designed limestone-clad trophy tower at 220 Central Park South, one of NYC\u2019s most expensive apartment buildings.\n\nThe rockstar-worthy residence offers 5,400 square feet of interior space, four bedrooms and 44 feet of frontage along Central Park. The aforementioned fireplace divides the living room from the sitting room, which has built-in bookshelves, with more shelves nearby in the library.\n\nAcross the living space is a stylishly-appointed chef\u2019s kitchen\u2013equipped with two refrigerators, four ovens and three dishwashers\u2013and one of the spiral staircases; adjacent is the dining room.\n\nOn the second level, accessible by a separate elevator entrance, there\u2019s a luxurious master bedroom with breathtaking Central Park views. The ensuite bath includes his-and-her dressing rooms, double spa baths and a sauna.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the 400-square-foot terrace, usable in all seasons thanks to heaters and a canopy.\n\nIn addition to those incredible views, residents at 15 Central Park West have access to spectacular amenities like a landscaped motor court, parking garage, 14,000-square-foot fitness center, skylit lap pool, sauna, screening room, private restaurant, wine rooms, a library, children\u2019s playroom and an outdoor terrace.\n\nOther famous residents of the \u201climestone Jesus\u201d have included Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, Bob Costas, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Alex Rodriguez and and a gaggle of hedge fund bigs.\n\n[Via NYP]\n\n[Listing: 15 Central Park West PH16/17B by Suzun J
