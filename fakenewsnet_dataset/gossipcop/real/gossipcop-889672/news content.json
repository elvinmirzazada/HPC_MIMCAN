In addition, he wants her to pay for his attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nThe reality star obtained a temporary restraining order against Bohan on September 18 over claims that he was violent. Two days later, she filed for divorce after 10 months of marriage. \u201cAudrina\u2019s No. 1 priority is her daughter right now,\u201d her rep told Us at the time.

A Los Angeles Police Department PIO confirmed to Us that Bohan was also ordered to move out of their family home by noon on October 13.\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
