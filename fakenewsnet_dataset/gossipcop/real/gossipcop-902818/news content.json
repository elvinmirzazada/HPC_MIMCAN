It\u2019s important to understand how and why over-conditioning occurs to maximise the benefits without ruining hair texture. Fortunately, over-conditioned hair symptoms are easy to spot, so read on to learn about the signs of over-conditioning your hair and how to fix it.\n\nConditioners are used for two main purposes: to moisturise the hair and to protect the hair. Such products hydrate, nourish, and strengthen the shaft whilst coating the cuticle in a protective seal. This extra layer helps protect your hair from damage and lends a glossy finish .\n\nWhat\u2019s Over-Conditioning Hair?\n\nEach time you use conditioner, you're coating your hair in a new layer of product. If you over-condition your hair, each cuticle will be heavily coated, making it impossible for other products, such as serums and oils, to penetrate and work effectively.\n\nOver-conditioning hair symptoms can occur in several ways:\n\n\u25cf Using too much conditioner.\n\n\u25cf Leaving conditioner on too long\n\n\u25cf Not rinsing conditioner thoroughly.\n\n\u25cf \u00ad Conditioning too often.\n\n\u25cf Using the wrong deep conditioner for your hair type\n\nSigns and Symptoms of Over-Conditioned Hair\n\nThere are several signs and symptoms of deep over-conditioned hair to look out for. If you have thick and dry hair, over-conditioning may seem impossible. However, product build-up is possible on any hair type. You'll notice your hair becoming unmanageable, soft, limp, or flat. Any sort of updo will be impossible, as your hair has no natural grip.\n\nOver-conditioning thin, fine hair weighs it down and makes it look oily and perhaps stringy. It's probably easier to see signs of deep over-conditioning on this hair type.\n\nThese over-conditioned hair symptoms are a sign that it is time to do some damage control and fix it ASAP to avoid hair breakage and other concerns.\n\nCan Over-conditioning Hair Cause Hair Loss?\n\nOver-conditioning can cause a series of problems. If you are wondering \u2018can over-conditioning cause hair loss\u2019, you are not alone. There is no direct evidence that the high use of conditioner contributes to hair loss, however, it does not do your hair any good. It can lead to the swelling of cuticles and even make the hair more brittle, making it seem like you have increased breakage and hair loss from deep over-conditioning.\n\nCan Over-conditioning Hair Cause Hair Breakage?\n\nYes! Over-conditioning hair can cause hair breakage and, therefore, hair loss. This is because using leave-in deep conditioning and overuse of regular conditioner products can cause the hair shaft to become dry and susceptible to hair breakage and loss. If you are using a product that has not been specifically designed for more regular use, then play it safe and stick to the recommended actions.\n\nCan Over-Conditioning Damage Your Hair?\n\nLike overusing most products, over-conditioning hair does eventually lead to damage. But don\u2019t worry. There is a way to fix over-conditioned hair breakage. Paying close attention to the signs and symptoms of over-conditioned hair will help you deal with the problems before it gets too far. So, what can you do to fix over-conditioned hair? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nHow to Fix Over-Conditioning Hair\n\nThe best way to fix signs and symptoms of over-conditioned hair is to use a clarifying shampoo to remove any product build-up.\n\nYou can also try an over-conditioned hair fix with a clarifying scrub such as Christophe Robin Cleansing Purifying Scrub . Exfoliating your scalp once a week will help prevent product build-up that blocks follicles and leads to itchiness and a greasy feeling.\n\nIf your hair shows signs like becoming soft and limp or symptoms like breakage due to deep over-conditioning, consider a protein treatment fix. Proteins help to strengthen and stiffen each hair strand to add texture back into the hair.
