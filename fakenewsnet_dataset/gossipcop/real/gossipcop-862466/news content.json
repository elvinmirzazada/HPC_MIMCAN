I feel like it was kind of out of my hands and blown into the media. It\u2019s not really how I wanted it. I obviously would\u2019ve rather handled something like this privately. It\u2019s embarrassing. It\u2019s really hard. There\u2019s no feeling like it \u2013 having to wake up every day knowing that this is going on, that people and the media are judging you.\u201d\n\nIn June, production on the fourth season of \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d was stopped briefly over allegations of misconduct surrounding a sexual encounter between DeMario Jackson and Olympios, neither of whom returned to the show.\n\nFollowing the scandal, both parties released statements, in which Olympios said, \u201cI am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4. Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production.\u201d\n\nNow, Olympios has clarified that she never meant she was a victim of Jackson, but rather, she was a victim of a bad situation and negative portrayal in the media.\n\n\u201cAt that point in time, I saw myself as a victim of having something this serious happen to you and have the media paint you a certain way that you know you aren\u2019t and having all these people make their judgments and comments and they don\u2019t even know what happened or went on,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m a victim of. I never meant that I was a victim of DeMario. I strongly believe he had no bad intentions at all. It was all good. It was unfortunate that no one really knew how intoxicated I actually was at the time. I believe that nobody knew that. It was nobody\u2019s fault. I was a victim of not really knowing what happened at the time. We were just really trying to get to bottom of everything.\u201d\n\nLast week, Jackson appeared on the show to give his perspective on what happened and how the scandal has affected his life. Warner Bros. announced nine days after production was halted that filming would resume, as their investigation did \u201cnot support any charge of misconduct by a cast member.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was difficult because I know who I am,\u201d Jackson told Harrison. \u201cI know I\u2019m not that monster that they\u2019re trying to portray on TV. Like Michelle Obama said, \u2018When they go low, you go high.\u2019 It was hard to go high. I had to do it because I train and mentor children and I can\u2019t tell them to be something that I\u2019m not. That\u2019s what kept me going \u2013 and great family, friends, school teachers, people at the gym \u2026 it was just crazy to see the response from them. My cast mates \u2014 Alexis, Raven, I think I FaceTimed Taylor every single day. There was so much love. I was extremely humbled.\u201d\n\nWatch Olympios speak out about the incident on Tuesday\u2019s episode of \u201cBachelor in Paradise.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CorinneOlympios.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/JoJo-Siwa-e1701133485803.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mark-cuban-shark-tank.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Special-Forces-e1701134398332.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/margot-robbie-jeffrey-wright-greta-lee-charles-melton-2023-gotham-awards.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CorinneOlympios.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CorinneOlympios.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Loree Seitz", "Dessi Gomez", "Lawrence Yee", "Sharon Knolle", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/corinne-olympios-bachelor-in-paradise-scandal-never-meant-victim-of-demario-jackson/", "title": "Corinne Olympios on \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 Scandal: \u2018I Never Meant That I Was a Victim of DeMario\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Corinne Olympios on 'Bachelor in Paradise' Scandal: 'I Never Meant That I Was a Victim of DeMario' - TheWrap", "description": "\"I strongly believe he had no bad intentions at all,\" former contestant says about controversy that halted production in June", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/corinne-olympios-bachelor-in-paradise-scandal-never-meant-victim-of-demario-jackson/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CorinneOlympios.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-08-29T14:38:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-29T14:39:07+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Corinne Olympios on \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 Scandal: \u2018I Never Meant That I Was a Victim of DeMario\u2019", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/corinne-olympios-bachelor-in-paradise-scandal-never-meant-victim-of-demario-jackson/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-08-29T07:38:34-07:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "parsely-tags": "bachelor-in-paradise, corinne-olympios, demario-jackson", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504017514.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
