The magistrate also reportedly says that Frazier credibly alleged Rogers had threatened her and her family\u2019s lives, and threw her phone against a wall to prevent her from calling 911.\n\nRogers\u2019 arrest comes nearly five months after his son, Camryn Kruze Rogers, was born. He announced in October 2017 that he and girlfriend Lindsey Renee were expecting a baby boy together. In January, In Touch reported that the couple had gotten married.\n\n\u201cMy boy !!! Finally !!!

I have talked about it enough. I did what was best for my body at that time, and I have moved on from it.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jenelle Evans Says She Has PTSD from Road Rage Incident: \u2018He Almost Knocked My Son Out\u2019\n\nHer divorce from Rogers was finalized prior to the birth of son Kaiser, 4, with ex-fianc\u00e9 Nathan Griffith.
