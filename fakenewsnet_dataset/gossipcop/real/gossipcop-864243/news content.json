She's graced the cover of People 57 times \u2014 more than anyone in the history of the magazine. And though royal comparisons can be made (see: Princess Diana and Kate Middleton's top twinning moments), the Princess of Wales had a fashion sense all her own. Although more than 20 years have passed since Diana's tragic death, her signature sartorial flair remains a classic.\n\n01 of 26 1980 Getty Images Still lacking a royal clothing allowance, the teenaged teacher's assistant topped her romantic pink evening gown with a plain wool coat for Princess Margaret's 50th birthday bash.\n\n02 of 26 1981 Landov She collaborated on her wedding gown with little-known design team David and Elizabeth Emanuel. \"In the end, the design process was quite simple because it was just the three of us,\" the duo wrote in A Dress for Diana. They had the future princess slip sample dresses on over her jeans: \"She was terribly excited to be trying on huge bouffant petticoats, satin skirts, and boned bodices.\" The final garment was made of British-woven silk and featured a dramatic 25-foot train. Princess Diana Apparently Felt \"Uneasy\" On Her Wedding Day\n\n03 of 26 1981 Central Press/Getty When Shy Di met with the press on her Scottish honeymoon, her finery was limited to her Welsh gold wedding ring inscribed with a message from the prince: \"I Love You, Diana.\"\n\n04 of 26 1982 Jayne Fincher/Getty The expectant princess made headlines in a single-shoulder, drop-waist Bruce Oldfield gown in vivid, blue silk. \"The English rose syndrome was never my bag,\" the designer once told a biographer. \"I liked to see her in much simpler things.\"\n\n05 of 26 1985 Jayne Fincher/Getty The princess was nicknamed \"Dynasty Di\" by the tabloids because of her wide-shouldered gowns like this silver Bruce Oldfield. \"She was very involved,\" Oldfield has said of his client's wardrobe, but, \"you'd have to be fast because she didn't have much patience.\" Actually, the '80s Dress Trend Is More Wearable Than You Think\n\n06 of 26 1985 Tim Graham/Getty Diana wore this wine, velvet Catherine Walker dress to a London premiere. Although it looked conservative from the front, the gown had an open back that the princess accentuated with a long pearl necklace worn backward.\n\n07 of 26 1985 Tim Graham/Getty Designer Victor Edelstein has said that the dresses he made for the princess were a collaboration: \"You each make suggestions and ask, 'What do you think?'\" In the case of this white gown and bolero, the partnership paid off. Years after she wore it to a New York event, she chose a photo of herself in the ensemble for the cover of her Christie's auction catalog.\n\n08 of 26 1985 Tim Graham/Getty For an appearance in Melbourne, Australia, Diana accented a single-shoulder gown with an emerald-and-diamond choker worn as a tiara. The necklace was a wedding gift from the queen, who likely imagined the deco treasure being worn in a more conventional way. Kate Middleton Reportedly Wore Princess Diana's Favorite Jewelry While Stepping in for the Queen\n\n09 of 26 1987 Tim Graham/Getty Images Victor Edelstein based this navy, velvet column gown on Edwardian evening designs. The princess famously wore it for a spin on the White House dance floor with John Travolta.\n\n10 of 26 1988 Tim Graham/Getty Images Proving that she needed little more than her statuesque frame to make an impression, Diana strolled the grounds at the Guards Polo Club in jeans and a sweatshirt, topped by a crisp blazer. 16 Blazer Outfit Ideas You'll Want to Wear Tomorrow\n\n11 of 26 1989 Tim Graham/Getty Diana attended a U.K. wedding in a white sheath dress and dove-gray coat accessorized with a traditional British wedding hat \u2014 and an even more traditional British umbrella.\n\n12 of 26 1989 Alpha/Globe The princess coupled her beaded ball gown from Catherine Walker with the Spencer tiara. She was known to have dresses altered for future wearings; a version of this gown with a narrow skirt would later sell at auction for $51,750. 10 Fashion Tricks Princess Diana Used to Make Old Clothes New Again\n\n13 of 26 1989 Tim Graham/Getty Images The high collar on this Catherine Walker pearl-encrusted bolero was inspired by Elizabethan ruffs. The less historically minded press christened the ensemble \"the Elvis dress.\"\n\n14 of 26 1991 Glenn Harvey/Camera Press/Retna For the Canadian premiere of Crocodile Dundee II, she chose a floral-print, ruched dress by Catherine Walker.\n\n15 of 26 1991 Tim Graham/Getty Images Princess Diana looked radiant at a London Kire Te Kanawa concert in a raspberry-hued Victor Edelstein gown. 16 Princess Diana Fashion Trends That Are Still Cool in 2022\n\n16 of 26 1992 Tim Graham/Corbis The princess visited the British School of Seoul in South Korea wearing a fitted green suit with matching pumps.\n\n17 of 26 1993 Tim Graham/Getty A hot-pink frock coat and matching skirt gave the newly-separated Diana a cheerful glow.\n\n18 of 26 1995 Jayne Fincher/Getty As a royal, Diana was required to wear British designers to boost the local economy. Post-separation, Diana often donned international couture like this crimson Christian Lacroix dress, worn in Paris. Princess Diana's Most Iconic Outfits Included the Color Red\n\n19 of 26 1994 Rex USA It was the LBD worth a thousand words: In 1994, just as a documentary regarding her husband's infidelities was airing, a lithe and leggy Princess Diana strolled into a Serpentine Gallery benefit wearing a figure-hugging ruched mini dress from Greek designer Christina Stambolian. The next day, every front page was devoted not to the Prince of Wales's televised confession but to images of the glowing, confident 32-year-old Diana. The Crown's New Season of Has All of Diana's Most Famous (and Infamous) Dresses Ever mindful of the power of fashion, three years later she auctioned off 79 of her favorite gowns at a Christie's auction that raised $6 million for AIDS and breast cancer charities.\n\n20 of 26 1995 Tim Graham/Getty What happened to Shy Di? The princess began to favor sheath dresses that showed off her slim shape, like this white Versace number she wore to a charity concert in Italy.\n\n21 of 26 1995 Rex USA Diana showed off her toned shoulders in a plunging, beaded cocktail dress by Catherine Walker. What to Wear When the Dress Code Is Cocktail Attire\n\n22 of 26 1995 Tim Graham/Getty Gianni Versace designed her Jackie O-inspired pink suit for a visit to the nation's troops. Her pillbox hat was by Philip Somerville.\n\n23 of 26 1996 Uppa-Ipol/Globe Diana wore an ivory, pearl-studded shalwar kameez to a cancer fundraiser in London. The pantsuit, which was a gift from her friend Jemima Khan, inspired her to commission similar Pakistani-inspired outfits from Catherine Walker.\n\n24 of 26 1997 Tim Graham/Getty Images Diana visited patients at an Angola hospital wearing a sleeveless chambray shirt and trim chinos.\n\n25 of 26 1997 Sutcliffe/Sipa Diana met with Mother Theresa in New York in a simple white suit and cap-toed pumps.
