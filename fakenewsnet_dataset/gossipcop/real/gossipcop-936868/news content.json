Patrick J Adams, who played Markle's on-screen love interest Mike Ross and departed the show along with her, was in attendance with his wife Troian Bellisario.\n\nSarah Rafferty Getty Images\n\nThe rest of the show's main cast also arrived: Sarah Rafferty, who plays Donna Paulson; Gabriel Macht, who plays Harvey Specter, Gina Torres, who plays Jessica Pearson; Rick Hoffman, who plays Louis Litt, and Abigail Spencer who plays Dana 'Scottie' Scott.\n\nGina Torres Getty Images\n\n\"We were with each other longer than we went to college or high school with our friends, so we became family in a way,\" Rafferty said during a Today appearance. \"We're still family, so this is a wonderful family affair.\" It was also confirmed during that appearance that the cast knew about Markle's relationship with Harry before the public did. \"We knew she was excited and there was reason to keep it close to the vest,\" Torres said.\n\n\n\nGabriel Macht and Jacinda Barrett Getty Images\n\nThe Suits cast held a dinner in London last night and shared pictures of the joyous occasion on Instagram. This morning, Adams also posted a pretty hilarious Insta in which he seemed to finally realize Markle was actually marrying Harry. \"I\u2019m beginning to think she might not actually be out getting milk,\" he wrote alongside a newspaper front page featuring Markle.\n\n\n\nAbigail Spencer (left) Getty Images\n\nMarkle confirmed in November that she is giving up acting to focus on her royal duties, hence her departure from the show along with Adams. \"They were really a major artery of the show, and now we have to sort of regenerate another artery,\" Hoffman said on Today. \"We're working on it.\" It was confirmed in January that Katherine Heigl will join the show in season eight, replacing Markle as its lead actress.\n\n", "images":
