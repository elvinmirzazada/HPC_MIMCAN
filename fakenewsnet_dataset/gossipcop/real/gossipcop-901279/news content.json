After 36 hours of labor I met a girl i love more than all the molecules in all the world. Happy birthday, Delta. Love, mom.\u201d\n\nAside from the birthday girl, Bell and Dax Shepard also have an older daughter, 4-year-old Lincoln.\n\nShepard spoke candidly about the pair\u2019s relationship and how they make it look easy, but assured that it\u2019s \u201cnot effortless.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do couple\u2019s therapy. We work it like a job,\u201d he said. \u201cRelationships aren\u2019t just perfect.\u201d\n\nTo assure that the duo gets one-to-one time with each other, Shepard, 42, shared that they have to \u201cjust commit to things.\u201d\n\nTodd Williamson/Getty\n\n\u201cIf I say, \u2018Hey, what are you doing Thursday?\u2019 It\u2019s never going to happen. But if I put something on the calendar \u2026 it works out,\u201d said Shepard.\n\nThe CHiPs star also recalled the most romantic thing he\u2019s ever done for his wife, who he married in 2013.\n\n\u201cShe was doing a movie in Alaska and I was shooting Parenthood and I couldn\u2019t go and she was going away for a long time. But then my schedule changed and I didn\u2019t tell her, so I got the seat next to her on the airplane and then I sweet-talked the gate representative to let me on the plane early. So when she went to sit down, I was in her seat reading a newspaper and she kept going, \u2018Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, sir. I think you\u2019re in my seat,'\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cAnd then she noticed those hands look familiar and then she started bawling when she saw that I was on the flight,\u201d he said.",
