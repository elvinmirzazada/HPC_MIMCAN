On the heels of a monumental March, where the actress secretly tied the knot with actor beau Thomas Sadoski and then gave birth to their baby girl, the actress told E! News that she couldn't be happier.\n\n\"Man, I love being a mother,\" she gushed. \"I love my family so much.\"\n\nUnfortunately for us, the famously guarded Twin Peaks star also added that she doesn't plan on sharing photos of her little girl with the public. \"I probably never will,\" she offered matter-of-factly. \"She's a secret.\" I guess that means we'll just have to ogle at photos of her beloved dog Finn\u2014not that we mind.\n\nSeyfried was just as private about her wedding day, which Sadoski later described to James Corden as \"beautiful\" when he appeared on the Late Late Show shortly after the big event. \"It was everything that it should be. It was just the two of us talking to each other,\" he recalled. For now, Seyfried seems more than content with her new family. \"I couldn't be more in awe of my life,\" she told E!.\n\nRELATED: Amanda Seyfried and Thomas Sadoski Step Out Together For First Time Since Welcoming Daughter\n\nCongratulations again, Amanda.
