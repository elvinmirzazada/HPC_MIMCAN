Popularly known by his first name as \"Elvis,\" as \"The King of Rock and Roll\" or simply as \"The King,\" he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century.\n\nQuotes by Elvis Presley [ edit ]\n\nThe first time that I appeared on stage, it scared me to death. I really didn't know what all the yelling was about. I didn't realize that my body was moving. It's a natural thing to me.\n\nSo to the manager backstage I said, \"What'd I do?

When I was a child, ladies and gentlemen, I was a dreamer. I read comic books, and I was the hero of the comic book. I saw movies, and I was the hero in the movie. So every dream I ever dreamed, has come true a hundred times... And these gentlemen over here, these are the type of people who care, they're dedicated, and they realize that it is possible that they might be building the kingdom of heaven, it's not just too far fetched, from reality.

One time I called a relative in Tupelo. It was Christmas and they were havin' dinner. I asked, 'What?' and she was kind of quiet, then said, 'Meat loaf.' I was shocked as we'd had the best, you know, turkey, ham, steak, everything. She said that it was near the first and they'd run out of money so they just had meat loaf. It hurt me. and so, I ate meat loaf for about eight months, every night, so I'd remember where I came from and to remind me of how many people were unable to have what I did.

This is where N.B.A. players come in. In 1956, Elvis Presley received his polio vaccine before one of his appearances on television, launching a highly effective vaccination campaign that by 1960 had reduced annual occurrences of polio by 90 percent. Health policy professionals suggest that public health campaigns using celebrities should focus on celebrities who are influential in particular communities in order to build trust. N.B.A. players, 81.1 percent of whom are Black, appeal to the under-35 and African-American demographics Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, in an Opinion Editorial on the Covid 19 pandemia, entitled \"We Should Let Some N.B.A. Players Jump the Vaccine Queue\", as published in the NYT's February 1, 2021 edition.\n\n\n\nLove you allways (Sic), from the XXXX King Photo dedication to Elvis by Prince Abdulmehsen, the 13th son of King Saud of Saudi Arabia and one of his several wives, Zainab (Um Thamer). A grammar and middle school student in London since the early 50's, and a huge Elvis fan, he and his three men entourage visited him at his rented house at #14 Goethestra\u00dfe in Bad Nauheim, Germany on August 22, 1959 in order to gift him with a Royal Arabic black caftan and a Tea Service with the Royal Coat of Arms, all of it as a sign of gratitude for Elvis having helped the King and his 75 person entourage, secure an entire hotel, the Grunewald, in Bad Nauheim, in January of that same year (Elvis and his family who had taken an entire floor, vacated it, in order for the King to have full privacy), as noted in the book \"A Date With Elvis: Army Years Revisited\" by Andreas Schr\u00f6er.

Gary Abernathy, contributor for the Washington Post, in an article dated 20 November 2018, and entitled \"Trump honoring Elvis? It's about time\", in reference to Elvis' being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in a ceremony held at the East Room in the White House, on November 16, 2018\n\n\n\nSongwriter Earl Brown was tapped to create a special finale song that reflected Elvis' emotions about the social upheaval of the time. According to the show's director Steve Binder, the resulting song, \u201cIf I Can Dream,\u201d was recorded with Elvis in the dark, almost in a fetal position, writhing on top of the studio's cement floor. And when he got done, Elvis came in the control room and asked for the song to be played more than a dozen times. Later, Binder also crafted a gospel segment populated with racially diverse singers and dancers, which he knew would spotlight the Southern-born Presley's disdain for prejudice. Fittingly, it was the highest-rated TV special of 1968 and signalled the rebirth of Elvis's career. Lori Acken, of ReMIND Magazine, reviewing NBC-TV's 1968 Elvis special, as published on February 6, 2018\n\n\n\nI loved Elvis since i was a kid, as my dad was a huge Elvis fan. His range was incredible high, or low and he could croon. His impact on me was his love of African American music. Yolanda Adams, in a filmed interview for Gracelancom\n\n\n\nI am reminded of a comment made shortly after the death of Elvis Presley by a musician he had worked with. He pointed out that despite an impressive vocal range of two and a half octaves and something approaching perfect pitch, Elvis was totally willing to sing off-key when he thought the song required it. Those off-key notes were art. Patrick H. Adkins, The Dream Vaults of Opar\n\n\n\nOne of the pieces recently up for auction by Phillips-- and setting the record for the most expensive Omega ever to sell at auction \u2013 was a wrist watch given to Elvis Presley by RCA Records in 1961 to celebrate his 75 millionth record sold. The 33 mm 18-karat white gold manually wound watch features a bezel set with 44 brilliant cut diamonds. The caseback features the engraving: \u201cTo Elvis, 75 Million Records, RCA Victor, 12-25-60. We were in on the bidding for that watch, which, according to our man there, Petros Protopapas, was very intense, with several watch collectors and Elvis collectors in on it. It was the most anyone at Omega had ever authorized to put a bid in for, and ultimately we garnered the piece at a hammer price of $1.8 million with buyers\u2019 fees and premiums. In fact, we could have secretly bid on it, but we wanted people to know that it was us bidding for it and why we were doing it as this is an important part of our past and it should not be locked in a safe, but in our Museum, so we can shared it with the world.

I was so dreadful it embarrasses me even now to think about it. Music was always a passion growing up, like I used to translate Elvis Presley songs into Russian and sing them at home. Now that I've had a few multi-platinum albums in Russia, I want to have a go at Ireland, the UK and the rest of Europe. My heroes were Elvis, Elvis and Elvis! One of my favourite Elvis songs is My Boy, and now that I have been told that it was written by an Irishman [Phil Coulter] I love it even more. Emin Agalarov, singer and businessman, son of Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov, in an article published in the USA Today affiliated North New Jersey's July 13, 2017 online edition, as well as following an interview published in the Irish Times\u032a March 22, 2015 edition.\n\n\n\nIt must have been in January of 1958 when I went to a record store to buy a 45rpm single for my older sister's birthday. I was 8 years old. When I got there, I asked if they had \"Wake up little Suzie\" by the Everly Brothers, a song she had told me was her favourite of those then playing on Mexican radios. They did, and just as it was being wrapped up the salesperson told me that there was a special, if I bought another. I asked which one should I get and he said, \"Of course, anything by Elvis\". So, in spite of never having heard of Elvis, I got the \"two for one\" special and headed back home. When my sister arrived from school I gave the Everly's record to her, \"two weeks in advance\" I said, but only as long as she allowed me to play the one I had bought for free. It was \"Don't be cruel\" with \"Hound Dog\" on the B side. The moment I heard the A side, that was it... Enrique Sealtiel Alatriste y Lozano, Mexican writer, promoter and diplomat, in his article, \"Elvis Presley\u02d0 An out of time obituary\", as published in la Revista de la UNAM. His timing was superb, as in less than 12 months, in June of 1959, there would be no Elvis records to be found in Mexican stores, as the second of his many bans there began to executed by the Government authorities.\n\n\n\nHe was an extraordinary figure of his and our time, his legacy tremendous in terms of the music he created, his films, and as an entertainment personality. The generosity that he showed toward others is simply remarkable and I think it's these aspects of his character, his persona, that make him such a special person. Albert II, Prince of Monaco, after his visit to Graceland on August 7, 2010 as noted by EPE.\n\n\n\nIn an era when radio stations refused to play Chuck Berry songs, calling it \u201crace music\u201d, Elvis broke down barriers. Janet Albrechtsen, Australian columnist, in an article entitled \"Beware mob rule in the new racism\" published in The Australian on 23 November 2017.\n\n\n\nI've kind of been infatuated with Elvis since I was a kid, just always watching documentaries and stuff on him. It had a little bit to do with that and, honestly, I just wanted him to have something that wasn't very common. Jason Aldean, explaining why he and his wife named their first son Memphis, as published on Soundslike Nashville on September 30, 2017.\n\n\n\nI remember we were in his bathroom, he took my hand, asked me to sit down in a black leather chair, said some beautiful things and then he asked me to marry him. Ginger Alden, who found Elvis lifeless in the main bathroom at Graceland, six weeks after he asked her to marry him in that same bathroom, in an interview for CBS aired in 1982.\n\n\n\nWhen Elvis Presley died, he left a worldwide legion of music fans in mourning. It was no different on Long Island, where he had been scheduled to perform at the Nassau Coliseum a week later. As many as 700 fans had camped out overnight to buy tickets to the concert, which sold out quickly. On Aug. 22, the night the concert had been scheduled, over 5,000 fans gathered in the Coliseum parking lot for an impromptu tribute to Elvis that lasted two hours. Of the 16,700 tickets that had been sold, only 1,250 were returned for refund.... Michael Alexander, quoting an Editor's note of a Newsday story originally published on Aug. 17, 1977.\n\n\n\nWhen Elvis Presley died in 1977 I was no more than six. On that summer night in August I was sitting between my parents in my grandfather\u2019s house in Italy where we were spending the summer holiday. We were watching television, then delivering to viewers the news of his death, with scenes of fans wailing at the departure of the artist who had engaged the world with his music and gyrating dancing, and personal charisma that made him adored by girls and an inspiration for boys. Last Thursday, at around midnight I received a call from one of my friends telling me that Michael Jackson had died, and one website confirmed the news even before CNN had. Both of them died, and there have still been those who say that death has not touched them and that they still live amongst us with their music and greatness. Yasser Al Ghaslan, Saudi blogger and journalist, as noted in the Global Voice's 30 June 2009 edition.\n\n\n\nTo host a Warhol show in a Hollywood Regency home felt like such an incredible opportunity, so when we were presented with it, we jumped at the chance. Given Warhol's fascination with Elvis, it was like this incredible opportunity to reenergize the home with the ghosts of the past in a supercool way. Part of what we love at the Future Perfect in general is the possibility to create that social interaction with the work that we present, because it completely changes the psychology of how you view it.\u201d David Alhadeff, founder of Future Perfect, a design gallery one of whose Los Angeles locations is at Elvis former home at the Trousdale Estates, now known as Casa Perfect, in an article published at Vogue Fashion's February 20,2019 edition.\n\n\n\nAs a child, I saw Elvis Presley. So that was something, I mean he was this person with a guitar and that was the image I wanted to be. I wanted to be a musician so I got my first guitar when I was thirteen years old, and I felt, oh man, now that I have the guitar, I got the music. But it started from that.... Lucky Ali, on what pushed him towards music, in an interview with WION'a published in their April 6, 2022 edition.\n\n\n\nLet us remember that Elvis\u2019s style \u2014 which often included all-leather outfits and flashy jumpsuits \u2014 was also controversial for its mid-century time period. So, is Post Malone truly our modern-day Presley? Judging by his care-free attitude and penchant for leather Cuban heeled boots \u2014another, Presley favorite\u2014the verdict would appear to be yes. Cristian Allaire, for Vogue, in an article entitled \"Is Post Malone the new Elvis Presley of today?\", as published on December 2, 2018\n\n\n\nI was standing in the hallway, just before the show, and one of the managers told him there was a girl on the telephone who was in the hospital. She said she had tickets for the show but couldn't come as she had a serious illness. And Elvis said, 'I want to talk to her', so he marched into a room and held up the entire show for fifteen minutes to talk to that girl, asking her several questions, with warmth and interest. Just before hanging up, I remember he said, 'No, honey I don't have a blue Cadillac. I've got a pink one, a black one, a white one \u2013 a pause, and then he said, oh yeah, I do have a blue one'. He was a gentleman and I respected that immensely. Lew Allen, a then 17 year old student who went on to earn an Associate's Degree in photography and a B.A. in Fine Arts/Photography from the Rochester Institute of Technology. He was asked to photograph Elvis at the Cleveland Arena in Ohio, on November 23, 1956 because of a labour strike affecting the three major newspapers, as told by Mr. Allen in an interview published in Rock paper on June 6, 2005.\n\n\n\nI didn't know very much about him, and those in the business knew very little about him. But, he was in the Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, so I saw this kid and it was hard to say what he had, but there was something unusual about him. He had an interesting quality and his sound wasn't that important. It was the way he conducted himself, the way he put a song over. Anyway, I made a note immediately to book him for our new show, and we just had the good fortune that between that night and when he appeared a few weeks later suddenly there was a lot of controversy and media attention. Steve Allen's answer as to how did the Elvis appearance in his ABC.TV show, which drew 40 million viewers following the NBC TV Milton Berle controversy came about, as told in an interview on June 30 of 1996.\n\n\n\nWhen in Tupelo, MS, you have to visit Elvis Presley\u2019s birthplace with Elvis himself Darby Allin, after touring Elvis' Tupelo birthplace on June 2, 2023\n\n\n\nIt was like a country show back then and we got to open it and we did a couple of his songs, which was just stupid because we thought we'd impress him and he'd like us. The first time I saw him play \u2013 I'd seen him one time before that particular tour came to town where we opened the show for him- I just couldn't believe it. He was such a rocker. I'd never seen anything like that before. Buddy was terribly impressed as well. All of us the same. Turned into a big fan. Buddy tried to sound like him for months. And personally, he was as charismatic as he could be...

Didn't you just LOVE him?\" she asked. \"Well, I thought he looked tired and sick and was just going through the motions.\" Whereupon she whacked me on the head with the rolled-up Elvis poster she was carrying. LOL. I took it in stride \u2014 nobody ever said it was easy being a music critic. ... Music critic Smiley Anders, writing for The Advocate in an article published on their March 25, 2019 edition.\n\n\n\nElvis Presley has been such a determining force in music, before and after his death. On a personal level, I owe so much to Elvis as he is essentially the musician who pushed me to be the performer I am. I have always loved his music so I am returning to celebrate him along with some of my amazing musician friends.

It had that thing about it \u2013 I didn't really know what it was \u2013, that set the pulse racing a bit; and then I heard echoes of it again, with early Elvis Presley. Ian Anderson, singer, flautist and leader of Jethro Tull, explaining to G.Brown, of the Denver Music Examiner, his first experience with hearing the blues, starting at the age of 7, as published in that newspaper's online edition, on August 11, 2008.\n\n\n\nUnbelievable!

King, Leontyne Price, Elvis Presley, James Earl Jones, Jim Henson, Morgan Freeman, Oprah Winfrey, Sela Ward, George Ohr, William Faulkner, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty, Tennessee Williams, and John Grisham\n\n\n\nHis latest album, \"Piano\", is a collection of his past work, stripped down so all you hear is his beloved piano. It was hearing an Elvis Presley song that sparked his passion for the piano when he was young. About ABBA-founder Benny Andersson's decision to take up piano, at age 11 in his native Sweden, specifically after hearing \"Treat me nice\", the B side of the \"Jailhouse Rock\" single, as noted by Tom Power of CBCRadio on December 10, 2017\n\n\n\nAfter doing \u2018Dr. No\u2019 with Sean Connery, the brass at Paramount proposed that I co-star with Elvis. At first I turned the offer down, mainly because after having dated James Dean, I had imagined Elvis to be an \"ordinary\" person. So they organized a meet-up and, to my amazement, I immediately fell for his charm. He was extremely well educated and when I told him I hated Rock and that I liked Gospel, he gave me his entire collection of gospel songs. Little did I know that was his main source of inspiration. Anyways, we became instant friends and he loved to cook for me when we were on location. He told me he would have loved to live in Europe and, when I told him my husband had sold our BMW 507, he gave me another as a present. Twenty years later, in 1982, I auctioned the one Elvis gave me for US$300,000 and then the person who bought it from me later sold it for 1.2 million UK pounds. He was in fact, a one in a billion type, a wholly adorable person and we remained in touch till his death. Swiss actress Ursula Andress in an interview published in Mujer Hoy, on 12 January 2016.\n\n\n\nHis knowledge was even more extensive than mine. I prided myself on knowing all that stuff. And man, we'd be hanging out and Elvis would be talking about singers I didn't even know about!!!. Sherman Andrus, Gospel Music Hall of Fame and one of the first African Americans to be integrated into a Southern Gospel group, (Elvis' personal group The Imperials), attesting to Elvis' deep knowledge of African American Gospel music, from the Gospel side of Elvis.\n\n\n\nMy older brothers played Elvis all the time and there was a lot about his music that inspired us all. Not only an inspiration but he showed up to give his generation permission on a lot of fronts to carry a torch. When I finally met him in Houston, it was like a receiving line at a wedding, as surreal a moment as any in my life. I could not even actually shake his hand. I just bowed. Canadian singer Andy Kim, interviewed by phone from Toronto by Patrick Bales and published on the Orillia Packet & Time website on March 17, 2017\n\n\n\nBeto, he's a rock star right now, he's Elvis Presley, Maximo Anguiano, of the Texas Organizing Project, in reference to Beto O\u2019Rourke being the candidate who could unseat Sentaro Ted Cruz in the 2018 mid-term elections.\n\n\n\nIn Vegas, we'd meet and we'd talk about everything. Slowly he started coming over to see my show; he'd sit up there and I'd come back after the show and we'd talk music. He would show up, this incredible God-like figure. He had everything, and the voice \u2014what a great voice he had. Then, on August 17, 1977 I happened to be in Las Vegas, so when I turned on the news and learned of his death, I cried all day. He was a cool, nice man. Paul Anka, from his autobiography \"My way\"\n\n\n\nI want to celebrate his life. He was so gifted, I just cherish his memory, his generosity, and he was so private, like I am. He knew about honour, and respect, and was so considerate, and his manners, and the way he was so civilized. And as an entertainer he will never be repeated. I wanted him to know all that, and I did tell him, but very few others did... Actress and entertainer Ann Margret, in an interview with Charlie Rose, as broadcast on February 11, 1994.\n\n\n\nI think there was that part of the so-called punk idea that everything in the past was rubbish and all that mattered was punk. I was never really interested in the spitting and the safety pins or that nonsense. I liked the Sex Pistols, and that was about it. Adam and the Ants were very much outside of that anyway. So my liking of Elvis and rock and roll music that I'd grown up with was always in there; it was always something that was a big influence. Elvis's death was tragic, I remember when he died, it was a very sad day in general, so it's obviously a great loss to everybody. I never thought, Oh, he was something that didn't matter, because he did. I have visited Graceland and you could see the man was overwhelmingly honest. He never professed any taste other than his own, that is, country boy made good. He never pretended to be anyone else. Adam Ant, leader of Adam and the Ants, a punk rock band, in an article published on September 5 2017, at the Tampa Bay Times\n\n\n\nOne day while he and Richard Davis were conversing he removed the watch from his wrist, handing it to Davis and stating there was something wrong with the back of it. When Davis turned the timepiece over to inspect it, he saw to his great surprise that the case back had been inscribed, \"To Richard, From E.P. Elvis then said, \"I guess it's yours now\". He was known for being extremely generous, often giving away his valuable personal belongings as presents so it was not surprising that he gifted his prized 18kt yellow gold Corum Buckingham to Davis. Antiquorum Auctioneers's notes for those attending the November 11 2018 auction held in Geneva, Switzerland, and highlighting the sale of a yellow 18k gold Corum 1960 Buckingham wristwatch gifted by Elvis to Richard Davis, his long time friend and last wardrobe manager, as detailed in Antiquorum webpage.\n\n\n\nIt was the early 1970s. I was 22, working in some little show in a hotel that's now gone, and he was doing a gig at the Las Vegas Hilton. We met backstage at a Tom Jones concert, then he showed me some karate moves, with a small party of folks ending up at his penthouse suite. There, he turned to me and said he had something to show me in his bedroom, so I thought, 'Oh, here comes the cliche,\u2019 Turns out, he just wanted to read to me from Kahlil Gibran\u2019s \u201cThe Prophet.\u201d It was a sweet moment, as he sat on a footstool beside me and read like a child, his finger following the text. He signed the book, gave it to me and told me to have a blessed life. He was so sweet, that's what struck me the most. In retrospect, I view him as a prisoner of his fame. That, and his roots in gospel music and the church, fueled his desire to seek out more knowledge about the world and self-realization. Actress Susan Anton, as told to Michael Grossberg at Dispatchcom.\n\n\n\n\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\u201d hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on Nov. 28, 1960, becoming Elvis' 15th No. 1 single. It would remain at the top of the chart for six weeks and nominated for Grammy Awards for Best Performance by a Pop Single Artist and Best Male Vocal Performance. A live version recorded in 1969 in which Elvis cracks up laughing almost throughout the spoken-word section would be a minor hit in England in the 1980s. At one point in that recording, Elvis becomes even more amused at one of his backup singers, who continues her part despite his laughter. That singer was Cissy Houston \u2013 Whitney Houston's mother. Charles Apple, in an article entitled \"Hitmaker\" as published in Spokane's The Spokesman-Review's November 22, 2020 edition\n\n\n\nThe biggest surprise about his singing had been revealed when he gave us a private concert and sang \"Love me tender\" a soft, ultra-slow ballad at the quaint music bungalow on the far west side of 20th Century lot. It was away from the bustle of traffic and from the big stages and it looked like the kind of cottage Walt Disney would have built for Snow White and Prince Charming. This was where Elvis felt relaxed, comfortable. So Ken Darby sat at the grand piano at the far end of the living room and Elvis stood a few feet behind him and in front of a tall stained-glass window. He stood erect, as if he was in a choir. Ken started to play the soft melody and I hardly knew that Elvis had started to sing, as his voice, barely louder than the piano, was pitched slightly higher than his usual. It had a lot of resonance and vibration and Elvis was on-key for every note, no matter how long, short, high or low. When he finished, it seemed only normal to express our amazement. \"People think all I can do is belt, I used to sing nothing but ballads before I went professional. I love to sing slow, but seldom get to do it\", he said, then continued to explain that, as a boy, an only child, he would sing like that when he sang with his mother and dad in church. \"It was a small church, only seated about 75, you couldn't sing too loud there.\" Army Archerd, a columnist for Variety then interviewing Elvis for the Photoplay magazine and who was present at the sessions, including an intimate concert for a dozen or so, which preceded the actual recording of the \"Love Me Tender\" soundtrack, as noted in a document entitled \"Photoplay (Jul-Dec 1956)\" as digitized by the Internet Archive in 2017 with funding from Media History Digital Library.\n\n\n\nIn the high-stakes game of Los Angeles real estate, a good celebrity pedigree is always a bonus. Of course, not all celebrities are created equal. A home that was once owned by Cary Grant or Elizabeth Taylor, for instance, would probably hold broader appeal than one formerly inhabited by, say, Zsa Zsa Gabor. On that score, David Alhadef definitely struck gold when he discovered the new location for Casa Perfect, the L.A. outpost of his furniture mecca, the Future Perfect: designed in 1958 by architect Rex Lotery and renovated in the mid-1960s, the house is an idiosyncratic mash-up of classic California modernism and Hollywood Regency. For six years, it belonged to Elvis Presley. Mayer Rus, for Architectural Digest in an article entitled \"Elvis Presley's Once-Home roars back to life as a dazzling showplace for contemporary furnishings, as published in AD's February 18, 2018 edition.\n\n\n\nWhen I actually received the phone call, I couldn\u2019t help my mind racing back to one magical day in 1956, that\u2019s always remained vivid in my memory. When my cousin, four years older than me, played me two and a half minutes of music, which changed my life. That music was Elvis Presley, singing Hound Dog, and for the next six months \u2013 to my mother's absolute horror \u2013 I didn't want to hear anything but the rawest rock'n'roll I could lay my hands on. Do you know? For those who didn\u2019t live through the Fifties, it\u2019s really hard to imagine the enormous cultural gulf which existed between England and America at that time. Elvis himself was a God and in some of the first footage that we saw in England, seemed to us like an alien super being from a distant universe. I was 11 years old and I couldn\u2019t in any way imagine being part of the same world. These early years were something of a dream. By 1964, we got a recording contract with Decca and then unbelievably by Christmas, found ourselves topping the U.S charts with our first record, \u201cShe\u2019s Not There.\u201d This magic land, which only eight years before had seemed so unimaginably remote and unconquerable and even more unbelievably, something we didn't find out until many years later, Elvis actually had our records on his jukebox. I could not believe that! Rod Argent English musician, speaking about his reaction when told his band the Zombies would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as noted by RollingStone's 30 March,2019 edition..\n\n\n\nI had been called up for national service and was stationed in Germany at the same time as Elvis when I came across an article on him in a magazine. The article even had his address in Germany, so with a girl friend we set off one morning to find him. We went there and rang the bell, it was a Sunday morning. The maid answered it and told us he'd be down in a few minutes. There was nobody else there, except my friend and I. He took us inside the hallway, and we had a nice chat. He posed for photographs and signed autographs. We were very lucky that morning. Arthur Armstrong, on his love of Elvis Presley, as originally featured in a 2011 article in The Impartial Reporter and again reproduced on their issue of 7 January 2019, following his death at age 81 on December 12, 2018.\n\n\n\nIf anything, it's a lot of people here right now. It's like my record collection is actually sitting in this room. I'm truly fortunate. You know, I've always loved rock & roll music. I always have. Soon as I opened my eyes and took my first breath, I was a fan. With my brother David, we listened to Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Cheap Trick and Pyromania by Def Leppard. My oldest brother Alan, he had the Beatles and the Stones and the Kinks. My sister Hollie was like \"Kool and the Gang.\" My sister Anna for that record collection that turned my world inside out. And my sister, Marci, who's pretty much the person who showed me Elvis Presley for the first time. Thank you so much. Excerpted from Billie Joe Armstrong's acceptance speech, as the founder, lead singer and frontman of the US punk supergroup Green Day, one of the 5 artists being chosen as performers at the 2015 edition of the inductees gala for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as published in its entirety by RollingStone magazine on April 18, 2015.\n\n\n\nI'm definitively going to make a record with him. You would be surprised what we could do together. You ask me if I think he is good. How many Cadillacs was it he bought.? That boy's no fool... Louis Armstrong, interviewed by Memphis Press Scimitar, March 1, 1957 edition.}\n\n\n\nMy cuban blood was flowing. My hips were revolving. I would have made Elvis look as if he was standing still Desi Arnaz, in his bio, \"A book\" , referring to his moves in 1939, while doing the conga.\n\n\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush was equally at ease in all settings, something that seemed so characteristic of the man I revered. But my work with him didn't end when he left politics. While working in government relations for Shell, I sometimes hosted foreign Ambassadors visiting Houston. On one occasion the Ambassador of Ukraine, Yuriy Shcherbak, was in town to meet with officials at NASA, give speeches and join up with the Ukrainian community there. On the last morning the Ambassador, who was a fan of Elvis Presley, did a live television interview on what by sheer coincidence happened to be Elvis' birthday, and the station had an Elvis impersonator on the set, to do a routine. When \u201cElvis\u201d and the Ambassador crossed in the green room, the two exchanged bear hugs, and we took pictures. We later arrived at Bush's office, and he cordially received Ambassador Schckerbak and asked how the visit had gone. He politely talked about the various events, then with a twinkle in his eye said: \u201cAnd this morning Bill introduced me to Elvis!\u201d. Bush gave me a quizzical look as if to ask, \u201cWhat have you done now?\u201d The Ambassador then recounted the whole tale, followed by robust laughter all around... Bill Arnold, former advance man for the then ( in 1980, therefore three years after Elvis\u032a death), Vice Presidential candidate George H.W. Bush and, since 2000 Professor at the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business, at Rice University, recalling the Ukrainian Ambassador\u032a to the US's fascination for all things Elvis, in an article written for the Houston Chronicle on the day after President Bush, for whom he worked, was laid to rest, December 5, 2018.\n\n\n\nOf course, it was 1957, he had a beautiful blonde on the back of his motorcycle. Now, I wasn't watching the blonde and I didn't know who he was, so I took him down to the Las Vegas police station where I then worked and I gave him a pass... Former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, recalling his most memorable traffic stop, which involved a speeding motorcycle driven by a young Elvis, as published in an interview with CBS's channel 5 on August 8, 2018.\n\n\n\nArguably some of the most important tracks in the history of Rock and Roll, Elvis' SUN recordings demonstrate what a dynamic and talented vocalist he was; the young, raw, unadulterated Elvis whom musicologist Francis Davis once called \"the greatest white blues singer\u201d; I'm not one to argue with Mr. Davis. Art's Strange World review of the CD \"The Sun Sessions\" (15 August 2007)\n\n\n\nElena Quarestani, an Italian collector with a Salvador Dal\u00ed painting, was entangled in these onerous rules, namely the Milanese officials wanting to protect his \"Figure at a Table\" (1925) as an example of Italian cultural heritage even though it is an early work of his that does not incorporate any of the motifs for which he is known. He would likely be amused by the surreality of the government's arbitrary ruling. Similarly, Andy Warhol would have loved that two of his early paintings hung in a casino in the German town of Aachen, a spa city near the border with Belgium and the Netherlands. On their way to slot machines and poker tables, gamblers passed \"Triple Elvis\", a 1963 silkscreen painting of three life-size images of Elvis Presley on a silver background and \"Four Marlons\", a 1966 silkscreen painting of four life-sized images of Marlon Brando on a motorcycle. Purchased in the late 1970s for $185,000 (approximately $700,000 today), the paintings were part of a plan to glamorize an otherwise off-the-beaten-track gambling parlor. When the casino conglomerate that owned the Aachen operation fell on hard times, a German state-owned bank seized control of the company and decided to sell the paintings. The sale was a reasonable action by the owners to raise cash for a troubled company. But protesters emerged, claiming this was a dangerous sale of cultural property owned by a state-run financial institution. The sale went ahead anyway, and the works sold for $151.1 million.

On his first visit, he took 40 dancing girls from the Lido to the Prince des Galles Hotel. On his next, he suddenly took a great shine to me but when someone told him I was trans-sexual, he stayed away. But, if by chance we would be in the same club, he would sent me a bottle of champagne every time. He was a divine human being. April Ashley, a MBE, born George Jamieson and the first male Briton to have full sex reassignment surgery, recalling the time she met Elvis in 1959, as published in the Mirror on November 4, 2018.\n\n\n\nWhere were you when you learned of Elvis Presley's death? I was at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center near Juneau, Alaska, escorting a group of senior adults. Like JFK\u2019s assassination, the first moon landing and 9/11, it's one of the events engraved in our memory, at least for us of a certain age. Elvis may have left the building for the last time 46 years ago, but he is still very much a part of our lives. For a man of the cloth whose worldview is woven with the fabric of faith, something called Graceland calls to mind much more than just a must-see landmark in Memphis. For me the name Graceland suggests an atmosphere where grace is embraced with intentionality and gratitude. It\u2019s a realm in which forgiveness and fresh starts comprise the air we breathe. Graceland is the territory of trust I believe the Creator created for His creatures to inhabit. After arriving in Florida on my recent flight, I noticed a street sign in the Sarasota neighborhood where I was staying. I did a double take. From a distance the sign appeared to say GRACELAND. But as I looked more closely it read GRAZELAND. Again, my always-looking-for-a-good-sermon-illustration radar detector began to flash with insight. Holy Week provides Christians an opportunity to revisit the central message of their faith and determine if they are currently living in the city limits of Graceland, or Grazeland. Chaplain Greg Asimakoupoulos, as published in the April 2, 2023 issue of the Kitsap Sun\n\n\n\nI found him to be an interesting person, had an entourage of good old boys, was busy with karate, breaking his hand while doing it, but he was nice and cooperative and friendly. I really liked him. Ed Asner, on the first time he met and worked with Elvis, namely during the shoot of \"Kid Gallahad\", in 1962, in an article published on July 16, 2018 on the Houston Chronicle.\n\n\n\nSouth African Elvis fans won't see his new movie 'Flaming Star' in their country. The government, which has strict laws to keep the races separate, banned the picture because Presley plays the son of an American Indian woman and a white man An Associated Press report from Johannesburg, dated May 31, 1961, the day when the film was set to open at theatres throughout the then Apartheid-ruled Republic of South Africa. A day later, 20th Century-Fox appealed and as a result the Board of Censors lifted the ban, on condition that the film not be shown to the country's indigenous population, with the film then opening to segregated theatres, starting in Durban in early June. However, it was permanently banned on cinemas in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, as colonial government officials in those territories were afraid the movie could reignite racial tensions in the aftermath of the bloody Mau Mau rebellion.\n\n\n\nPrincesses Margrit of Denmark (now HRH, the Queen of Denmark), Margaret of Sweden and I, were assigned to represent the people of Scandinavia on the SAS' maiden intercontinental flight to Los Angeles. We went to Disneyland, then to the Paramount Studios. He was making a film, we watched him sing a song and then he greeted us. He was very polite, a man with an M in capital letters. He was very pretty, had been our idol and we three had heard all his records, seen all his movies, so when I found out he had died, I was very saddened. Princess Astrid of Norway, as told to Roger Mostad, son of Tod Mogstad, the Princess's personal hairdresser on October 12, 1987, and as detailed in a clip from youtube, THE KING, THE PRINCESS & ME\n\n\n\nIn times of trouble, I put my faith in Elvis Presley, who represented the South's better angels. He was a hard worker, and although he lived the high life, he never forgot that he had been born into poverty. And he was a self-made talent, perhaps the greatest entertainer of all time, born in a two-room shack in Tupelo, Miss., in 1935. I've been to that small shotgun house many times, reflecting on what it says about America. Greatness can be born anywhere. His father Vernon was a laborer who was often out of work, and the Presleys relied on the kindness of family and neighbors to get them through the hard times.When Elvis was young, the Presleys lost it, and they ended up shuttling around Tupelo, often living in black neighborhoods, where Elvis famously developed an ear for black gospel and blues to supplement his love of the old-time gospel he knew from his own church.I still believe in my heart that most Southerners are still more like Elvis than President Trump. We are most likely to pull over and help someone stranded on the roadside. Most of the people I know in my Mississippi town would give you the shirt off their backs. Most Southern preachers don't spend Sundays in the pulpit spewing hatred and intolerance. Most people agree that racism and white supremacy are evil. Even preschoolers know it's always better to tell the truth and take your lumps than lie and evade. And yet here we are. We know right from wrong, but most of us down here voted for wrong. As Elvis once said, \u201cTruth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain\u2019t goin\u2019 away. Ace Atkins, in his article, \"In Elvis we trust\", part of TIME magazine's August 6 special issue on the American South.\n\n\n\nElvis changed the country music scene quite a bit; he almost put country music out of business. He was white, but he sang black. It wasn't socially acceptable for white kids to buy black records at the time. Did I have any sense of how big he was going to be when he first came to RCA? Oh yeah, we knew. Back in those days, if a guy got hot in one area you could spread it around the country, maybe the world. He was already so big in East Texas and Louisiana you couldn't get him off stage with a firehose. We knew. When he came in to do \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d I called up my wife and told her to come over. I said, You might not get a chance to see him again, he's gonna get so damn big. Lots of people have asked me if Elvis could play guitar. Well, he played pretty good. And he played piano and drums. The first sessions he'd come in and work. After that, when he got more confident, he'd come in and play drums a while, then guitar, then piano only to then go to work starting around 11 o'clock at night. But he loved gospel music. The first time I ever heard him I thought, \u201cWhat in the hell is this?\u201d I couldn't tell if he was black or bluegrass or gospel or what. Of course that was what made him what he was. He was so damn versatile he could sing anything. Chet Atkins, Pop Chronicles, Show 8 \u2013 The All American Boy: Enter Elvis and the rock-a-billies.

Beyond the staggering realization of what we had found, there was a musical element that also knocked our socks off: On these tapes Glen is singing pure rock and roll and with a sense of joy, passion and wild abandon that can only have come from knowing that his idol, the avatar Elvis Presley, would be an audience of one for these recordings.\u201d Stephen Auerbach, detailing for RollingStone what he felt after finding and playing tapes which had been lost of Glen Campbell doing demos for Elvis, as published on October 31, 2018.\n\n\n\nWhen Elvis came back from the service and he was greeted by all the publicity, the press, the photographers, reporters, and so forth, someone said to him \"Well, what do you think now that you're not number one but Avalon is ?\" And he said \" Oh, I love his song \"Venus\" and there's room for everybody.\" And I thought that was really genuine, nice compliment.

It was the same thing with Frank Sinatra and the Count Basie band, with Quincy Jones producing. They did \"Wives and Lovers\", which is in 3/4 time, but they did it in 4/4.

That was extremely immodest and foolish of me, my apologies. I would never dare to be so presumptuous. I am only interested in the legacy my father has left behind, and I would like to work towards giving it strength and respect for as long as I live. Indian entertainer and former politician Amitabh Bachchan's answer to a question posed by a reporter on whether he recalled his once saying that he would like to leave a lasting legacy in the world, to be a sort of Elvis Presley, as published on the \"Asian Age\" on May 13, 2018\n\n\n\nI'm living proof that Elvis was a pretty good driver. As innocent as the BMW 507 with its white paintwork might have looked, with a 150-horsepower V8 under the bonnet, it was something very special and Elvis drove like a maniac! Foot hard on the gas, then hard on the brakes, switching between lanes, slaloming between cars \u2013 it was like all hell had broken loose. (I was scared), and as a result wasn't quite able to enjoy the experience. The unvarnished truth is that I was just happy that we managed to get the car back to the dealership without a scratch on it. That short time I spent with Elvis was wonderful, though. The next day, I wrote to my mother , saying that I'd driven 100 miles up the autobahn with Elvis Presley. She thought I was kidding.\u201d Gus Backus, a member of the racially mixed doo-wop group The Del Vikings, recounting for BMW Group Classic the time then Private Elvis Presley asked him (then serving with the US Air Force in Germany), to accompany him as he was test driving a BMW 507 in Frankfurt. It was after the test drive that Elvis ordered specifications be made on another BMW 507, the now famous BMW 507 chassis #70079 previously owned by German car racer Hans Stuck and which is currently housed at the BMW Museum after a two year multi million euro restoration.\n\n\n\nIn May of 1998 I was in the middle of an Elvis Presley obsession, so I went to Graceland. Everything about the place seemed awesome to me, from the giant Corinthian columns out front, to the purple and yellow room with three televisions built into the wall, to the big man\u2019s grave out back. But what has stuck with me the most from the visit is a particular story about Elvis. Elvis had grown up poor, and I\u2019m sure when he was poor money was important. But when he started to make more money than he could ever spend, or maybe just enough money to have every material thing he wanted, it no longer held importance to him. So, during a party at Graceland he was inside with a guest who came from a poor background, and the other partygoers were outside on the lawn. His friend commented on how sophisticated all of the partygoers seemed. Elvis walked over to his desk, pulled a stack of money from one of the drawers, opened a window, and threw the bills out the window. The partygoers scrambled after the bills, shoving each other, trying to grab as much money as they could. Elvis turned to his friend and said, \u201cThey\u2019re not that sophisticated.\u201d Brett Baker, for Chicago now, published on December 22, 2016.\n\n\n\ni) We can even hazard a little analysis as to what made his voice so appealing. \"That curious baritone,\" one critic called it. Actually, that is inexact. The voice had mixed propensities, hovering between tenor and bass and everything in between. Even a convincing falsetto lay within his range. One thing he was not, ever, was \"Steve-'n-Edie\", the polished, professionally accomplished Vegas artistes who once pronounced on an afternoon interview show (Mr. Lawrence enunciating the sentiment for himself and his partner/wife, Ms. Gorme), \"We don't really think of Elvis as a singer. But he was a star.\" It is only when, years later, one gets past the indignation of hearing such apparent ignorance, that the sense of the observation becomes clear. A singer is someone like Steve Lawrence rolling effortlessly (and meaninglessly) through a shlock-standard like \"What Now, My Love?\". More or less like doing the scales. A star is the persona in whom one invests one's vicarious longings, a being who is constantly hazarding \u2014 and intermittently succeeding at \u2014 the impossible stretches that every soul wishes to attempt but lacks the means or the will to. It's not a matter of virtuosity. ii) Take My Baby Left Me (1956) by Arthur \"Big Boy\" Crudup, the black Mississippi sharecropper whose That's All Right had literally been Elvis' first recording, in 1954. Crudup kept his blues in a bucket; Elvis put the lid on, and cooked; bar by bar, the song comes together; first comes D.J. Fontana's rapped-out drum riff, then a top-to-bottom run from Bill Black's stand-up bass, then the controlled gallop of Scotty Moore's lead guitar; then, last of all, Elvis singing in that imperious velvet growl of his, \"Yes, my baby left me! Never said a word\"; it is the most underestimated song in the canon; there is lightning in that bucket, and it could drive a train, any train. It literally took us into a new age. Endow a university! Elvis was a university.

When he danced, the people danced, the girls would actually faint because of what he was doing. The people didn't care if he was white or black, he was a good artist and they felt his music. Lavern Baker, commenting on her covering one of Presley's best early 60's songs, with a few changes in the lyrics, which she recorded in late 1961 as a answer to Presley's \"Little Sister\".\n\n\n\nPresley's voice was remarkable in the sense that, through it, he touched people in a way only great artists can do. (In fact), the people he touched are as diverse as humanity itself and, because of that his popularity has transcended race, class, national boundaries, and culture. There is no simple answer about why that is so, all I can say is he had that magic. When Elvis Presley was first popular, many people said that he did not have a good voice. Almost everyone, today, knows that he did, but more people today should see him not simply as a performer, but as an artist with a great soul. John Bakke, professor emeritus of the University of Memphis, in an interview with the US State Department, transcripted by UNUSINFO on July 18, 2006 on the legacy of Elvis Presley\n\n\n\nI don't think any two men on this planet ever had the charisma of Elvis Presley and Jackie Wilson. The two of them remind me of each other: the charisma Hank Ballard, rhythm and blues singer and songwriter, lead vocalist of the Midnighters, as noted in the book \"Jackie Wilson: Lonely Teardrops\" by Tony Douglas.\n\n\n\nWith him, it's the pictures that spoke loudest about the man behind the genius. Take Sunday Times photographer Chris Smith's classic shot in which a scowling Seve, handsome head turned from the driving rain, jacket held across his chest like a matador's cape, and he is curling his lip. It tells you everything you need to know about his mood, his game, and his grim determination to outfox the elements and annihilate his opponent. It's pure Elvis. About Seve Ballesteros, Spain's all time greatest golfer, as reported in the Sunday Times on May 8, 2011.\n\n\n\nThen, in 1954, Elvis happened. The influence that the softly spoken Mississippi native had on popular music \u2013 and in particular rockabilly \u2013 is incalculable. First billed as 'The Hillbilly Cat' (again a nod towards black and white influences), the boy with the seemingly rubber limbs sang both blues and country songs infused with elements of this new rockabilly movement to the bemusement of a music industry not yet aware of the significance of what they were listening to. They didn't know it at the time, but the music establishment had just changed forever. Two years later he signed with RCA and the ensuing exposure he received on national television introduced rockabilly to its widest audience yet and, like fire to kindling, there was no stopping its spread. Other labels swooped to sign up any artists who sang even vaguely similar to Elvis and there was a bona fide musical gold rush underway and record executives and studio bigwigs fell over themselves to capitalise on this musical trend which was now sweeping the nation \u2013 ultimately playing a big part in rockabilly's eventual downfall, as more and more people tried to make money from it, (thus) watering down its raunchiness as they tried to make it appear to as large a market as possible, and (finally) taming its sound beyond recognition. Excerpted from an article entitled \"The Roots of Rockabilly: Examining the origins of a rock n' roll movement\", by John Balfe, and as published in www.entertainment.ie\n\n\n\nI might be the biggest Elvis fan you've ever met. I mean, I've seen it all. And I just loved him. I don't know what it was. I mean, probably the same reason everybody loved Elvis. Cause he was electric. He was just electric, the greatest entertainer I've ever seen, and I think the reason why was because \u2014 and I heard him say it many times in interviews \u2014 , he always did what he felt. Genuinely did what he felt. It wasn't choreographed. It wasn't, OK, well, I'm gonna do this move at this time. It was coming up from inside of him, and it was coming out. That's what it was, and that's why people connected with it. Cause it was the real deal.\u201d Country music songwriter and singer Frankie Ballard who, along with a few others, voted Elvis as the top entertainer in CMT Top 40 artist countdown, as published in CMT\u00b4s online edition of November 21, 2014.\n\n\n\nIt was the autumn of 1971, and two tickets to an Elvis show turned up at the offices of Creem magazine, where I was then employed. It was decided that those staff members who had never had the privilege of witnessing Elvis should get the tickets, which was how me and art director Charlie Auringer ended up in nearly the front row of the biggest arena in Detroit. Earlier Charlie had said, \u201cDo you realize how much we could get if we sold these things?\u201d I didn't, but how precious they were became totally clear the instant Elvis sauntered onto the stage. He was the only male performer I have ever seen to whom I responded sexually; it wasn't real arousal, rather an erection of the heart, when I looked at him I went mad with desire and envy and worship and self-projection. I mean, Mick Jagger, whom I saw as far back as 1964 and twice in \u201865, never even came close. Rock critic Lester Bangs's opening sentence in Elvis' obituary, by special request from and published by the Village Voice on 20 August 1977.\n\n\n\nI mean, don't tell me about Lenny Bruce, man \u2013 Lenny Bruce said dirty words in public and obtained a kind of consensual martyrdom. Plus which Lenny Bruce was hip, too goddam hip if you ask me, which was his undoing, whereas Elvis was not hip at all. Elvis was a goddam truck driver who worshipped his mother and would never say \"shit\" or \"fuck\" around her, and Elvis alerted America to the fact that it had a groin with imperatives that had been stifled. Lenny Bruce demonstrated how far you could push a society as repressed as ours and how much you could get away with, but Elvis kicked \"How Much Is That Doggie in the Window\" out the window and replaced it with \"Let's fuck.\" The rest of us are still reeling from the impact. Sexual chaos reigns currently, but out of chaos may flow true understanding and harmony, and either way Elvis almost single handedly opened the floodgates. Lester Bangs, \"Where Were You When Elvis Died,\" originally published in \"The Village Voice\", August 29, 1977.

Sexual chaos reigns currently, but out of chaos may flow true understanding and harmony, and either way Elvis almost single handedly opened the floodgates.\n\nElvis' lowest effective note was a low-G, as heard on \"He'll Have To Go\"(1976); on \"King Creole\" (1958), he growls some low-F's; going up, his highest full-voiced notes were the high-B's in \"Surrender\"(1961) and \"Merry Christmas Baby\" (1971), the high-G at the end of \"My Way\" (1976 live version), and the high-A of \"An American Trilogy\"(1972); using falsetto, Elvis could reach at least a high-E, e.g, as in \"Unchained Melody\" (1977), so, it was very nearly a three-octave range, although more practically two-and-a-half. George Barbel, as a follow up to a question on what was Elvis' range, as published in All Experts.com, on 20th May, 2007.\n\n\n\nI have nothing to do with him and therefore no reply is necessary Brigitte Bardot's answer to a journalist who had been present at Elvis Press Conference at the Prince des Galles Hotel in Paris, on June 17, 1960, and where Elvis had stated he would welcome meeting her during what turned out to be his first of three US Army furloughs in Paris. Would she meet him? the journalist asked. As published in Briggite Bardot.net's August 16, 2017 edition.\n\n\n\nBy the time we got towards the end of our stay there, Elvis was worn out, so he got all the singers individually to do a song. Of course, all the musicians knew that I play and sang and they knew some of my songs. Elvis was obviously hesitating and thinking of something else to do, and Ronnie said: 'Let Bardwell sing'. He just went, 'Yeah, right ...'. And Guercio said, 'No, really. You wanna do something else, let him sing, because he can sing'. So Elvis went, 'Ladies and gentlemen, my bassplayer is going to sing now'. So Charlie Hodge gave me his guitar and I got Charlie's mike. Charlie was holding another mike on the guitar, for me to play it. And I didn't know what to do. I mean, how am I going to follow Kathy Westmoreland doing 'My Heavenly Father'? And Donnie Sumner said, 'Do the Hurricane song'. You know, 'Please Don't Bury Me' by John Prine. I got to the last verse of the song that's a bit off color. We were going from 'My Heavenly Father' to 'Kiss My Ass Goodbye', and it just took everybody by surprise. That was a really good moment, because I had shown Elvis a part of me that he didn't know of. He knew that what we had just done was show business, and it was good show business, because it was entertaining. I went back to the dressing room after the show, and Tom Diskin knocked on the door. We let him in, and he said 'I have a message for you from the Colonel' So I figured that I was fired when he sent Tom Diskin into the dressing room, but he said, He wants me to tell you that that's one of the funniest things he's ever seen at an Elvis Presley show'. I was thrilled with that. If I didn't do anything else I had done that. That was fun TCB Bass player Duke Bardwell's story of how how he got to sing John Prine's \u2018Please Don\u2019t Bury Me\u2019 during the October 14th, 1974 closing show in Lake Tahoe, NV, in an interview with Arjan as published on the FECC Forum'spage.\n\n\n\nBaritones UnBound continues the second season of Asolo Rep's five-year American Character Project, an in-depth look at this nation and its people.

There was a customer off to the side looking at a display case that held nothing but expensive Browning over-under shotguns. Presley went up to the gentleman and commented on how nice the guns were. The man agreed, but said they were way out of his price range, since they were all probably in the thousand dollar plus area. Elvis asked the guy which one he would buy if he was purchasing, and the fellow said probably the Diana grade with the gold inlay. Elvis then went back to the counter where Jerry Knight was, and as he left said to Jerry, \"When that guy gets ready to leave, take that Diana grade shotgun out and put it on the counter and give it to him. Tell him Elvis said Merry Christmas.\" Jerry said he did just that, and he thought the guy was going to faint when he received the gift. Ken Barnes, who worked at Kerr's Beverly Hill's Sports Shop, as published by the Californian on December 13, 2017.\n\n\n\nNot only did Elvis give teens their own music with which to identify, he proved that much of the disposable income of this generation would be spent on music, fashion, and media of its own choosing and thus turning that generation into a high-pro!le, identifiable group with their own fashion sense, hair styles, slang, taste in music, preferences in movie stars and other favorite pastimes.

Moreover, given that people knew that I didnt make up stories and because of the large audience I had just reached in \"Good Morning America\", I thought that we may have had sent Elvis over the edge.

The \"extreme\" characteristics of sci-fi and high-end art help teach investors\u2014or readers\u2014important lessons. Science fiction speaks to human nature, while art offers a window on the nature of asset markets. What then qualifies as \"extreme\"? Take Andy Warhol. In 1986, collectors could buy a Warhol \"Triple Elvis\" painting for about $200,000, but a \"Triple Elvis\" went for $81.9 million at auction in 2018. That's a 400-fold gain\u2014an investor's dream.

The song \"Deula yo joban timilai deula\" may have sounded similar to what was trending internationally, but was given a funky twist of his own, and arguably was responsible for introducing rock and pop to the entire nation. He became a heartthrob in his country and was soon called the Elvis Presley of Nepal because he came like a breath of fresh air in a music scene dominated by traditional tunes.

So, I took his hand and held it softly as the winner was announced. Although his name wasn\u2019t called, Austin is no less a winner.

Diego Maradona is Elvis Presley singing 'My Way' at his last concert at the Market Square Arena in Indianapolis. He embodies the deity, the absolute power, the sunset, the snowy peaks and the abyss. And Lionel Messi is Paul McCartney, the long-play list, the continuity and the health.

( A year passed, and while in Las Vegas) Elvis came backstage to say hello and he couldn't have been more decorous, insisting in calling me Mr. Belafonte. Only later would I learn that he had hung out for years with a lot of black musicians and had come by his style legitimately. (Alas), he performed with such put on flash that over the next years, I noticed, he inspired a whole generation of R&B players who thought they could put that flash on, and become Elvis, too..

I spent my formative years playing air guitar while listening to the monolithic stereo console in my parents. My first concert experience was seeing an Elvis Presley in Knoxville. I was just about four years old but have some vivid memories of holding my parents' hands and people screaming, so it was kind of scary. I also remember him doing \u2018Hound Dog\u2019 and \u2018Teddy Bear.\u2019 And \u2018Teddy Bear\u2019 was such a favorite at the age of four that I brought out a big styrofoam guitar for it.

It was black music. He wanted to be a gospel singer the way the black people sang. Long back, he'd sing to a broom, pretending it was a guitar. We thought he was crazy....

So I wanted the album (cover) to be recognizable, but also for the Western artists to be big, just to show how important these Arab artists are as well.\u201d Zineb Belrhiti, the UAE's top album designer, telling the Arab News why she chose Elvis images as well as those of Lana del Rey and Adele as inspiration for the album covers of Arab artists, in an article published on August 5, 2021.\n\n\n\nElvis Presley is undeniably one of the most iconic and influential figures of the 20th century. Bendigo Art Gallery's Curator Lauren Ellis' laud of Elvis, as noted in Scenestr's March 28, 2022 edition.\n\n\n\nDid you ever meet Elvis Presley? Pope Benedict XVI's question to the then terminally ill Irish comedian Frank Carson, who, in 1987, had been ordained with a Papal knighthood of the \"Order of St. Gregory\" by the now Saint Pope John Paul II. The then sitting Pope's interest, expressed some 30 years after Presley's death, may lie in the fact that he was stationed, as a young professor within the German priesthood at a town not too far from Presley's barracks during his 18 month stay in Germany with the US Army. Carson's zany reply to the Pope? \"Not yet, your Holiness, but I soon will\", (Published in the Belfast Telegraph on August 10, 2017).\n\n\n\nI think she's going to become as big as Elvis Presley. He was, incidentally, the handsomest guy I ever met in my life, and a very nice person too. Tony Bennett, referring to singer, songwriter, and actress Lady Gaga in an article on Billboard published on August 17, 2011 and during an interview with the Guardian, on 17 October, 2013.\n\n\n\nI remember the first time in '56, I saw Elvis. I'm like, I'm buying that record because it's just the look that gets you, it's almost as much as the music. I kind of always had this theory that you look and listen with your eyes and your ears at the same time. He was the first rock 'n roll artist I loved. In my life, I started with him, but as I got into music, Elvis and the Rolling Stones led me to blues. Bill Bentley,American music industry executive in an interview with Salon, published on May 25, 2018.\n\n\n\nI listen to a lot of Elvis on the school bus. My bus driver, Ken Lyons, is \u2014 was, he's not with us anymore \u2014 but he's the biggest Elvis fan. So Channel 13 on SiriusXM radio, many, many nights listening to Elvis Presley and him educating me on Elvis. He's great, he's one of a kind. You can label him however you want to, but his country career was unbelievable. He had a voice that even if you didn't see all the moves and how good looking he was and all that stuff, you just listen to his voice when he's on the Louisiana Hayride with Faron Young and it's like, 'Wow, his voice is really unbelievable.' Great singer. And lot to learn. Dierks Bentley, in an interview with popculturecountry and published on their February 15,2019 edition.\n\n\n\nThe reason I chose Elvis Presley' songs as the teaser for this article is to trigger some autobiographical memories for adults who were adolescents when his music topped the charts, which he dominated throughout the 1950s. Hopefully, these songs will inspire older adults, baby boomers, and people of all ages to get up from your chair and dance.... Christopher Bergland, activities of daily living in an article entitled \u030a\"One More Reason to Keep Dancing\u030a\" as published in Psychology Today's December 19, 2018 edition.\n\n\n\nAppropriation, then, has something to do with intent. When another culture's property is exploited for profit, that's appropriation, and it's always deserving of criticism. Elvis was just being Elvis. In \"Elvis Presley:The Searcher\" an HBO documentary, its signal achievement is in showing how the singer's early years, family culture, and socioeconomic background made inevitable the musician he was to become. It makes clear that he was, first, and foremost, a committed artist, utterly dedicated to music and its ability to move people. Robby Berman, as published on the Big Think's April 19, 2018 edition, in an article entitled \"Was Elvis Presley a cultural appropriator of black music?\n\n\n\nFernest Acernaux was not playing zydeco on that accordion, it was rhythm and blues. And you couldn\u2019t make it playing French, so we played blues and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll from Fats Domino, Bobby Blue Bland and Elvis Presley. Rod Bernard, celebrating his 72 years of pioneering \"swamp pop\", which combines New Orleans-style rhythm and blues, country and western, and Cajun and black Creole music, as \u00b4published in the Daily Advertiser on November 6, 2017.\n\n\n\nElvis is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century. He introduced the beat to everything, music, language, clothes, it's a whole new social revolution \u2013 the 60's comes from it.\u201d Leonard Bernstein, as told to TIME founder Henry Luce's top aide Richard Clurman in an article published by TIME on August 10, 2017.\n\n\n\nDescribe Elvis Presley? He was the greatest there ever was, is, or ever will be. We did not have the airwaves he had, but he delivered what he obtained brilliantly. Let me conclude by saying that I realized during those early years that Elvis and I were creating a new sound. When I heard on the radio that he had died, I had to pull my car over to the shoulder of the road as I couldn't believe the initial reports. Elvis's art was a unique art, his style influential enough to be copied by many. But, no one can copy his. The one thing Elvis had that no one else had was THAT voice Chuck Berry as published in http://www.elvis.net/whattheysay/theysayframe.html as noted in Harry DeWitts Elvis, the Sun years, and In a AugusT 18 of 1977 phone interview\n\n\n\nEventually, everybody has to die, except Elvis. Dave Berry, as published in http://www.elvis.net/whattheysay/theysayframe.html\n\n\n\nWe all had similar tastes in the band it seemed. I don't remember the first album I bought but the first record I got was Hound Dog by Elvis.And of course, everybody listens to Elvis now and then. Pete Best,the Beatles' first drummer, in an article published on May 4th, 2015 in which he was asked what was the first record he bought and whether he still listens to Elvis 40 years after his death.\n\n\n\nWelcome to the \"Veranda Suite\", Elvis Presley used to stay here... The Beverly Wilshire Hotel's Front Desk introduction to room 1001 on the 10th floor, which highlights a rooftop yurt purported to provide its guests with a one-in-a-million urban glamping experience right in the centre of the city of Los Angeles, as detailed in an article in the Telegraph on February 21, 2018.\n\n\n\ni) When you think of Vegas, of show business, of flash, of those performances, you think of Elvis. He is iconic; a lot of performers today look to that for inspiration ii) You have to have soul to sing like Elvis, and Elvis had soul\" \" Beyonce, i) as published in www.graceland.com and ii) Elvis Viva Las Vegas documentary.\n\n\n\nElvis Presley movies \u2013 I'm a big Elvis fan \u2013 although I don't think you should feel guilty about pleasures. UK comedian Sanjeev Bhaska's answer to a question on what is his biggest guilty pleasure, in an interview with the Mail Online published on July 29, 2018.\n\n\n\nWhen they asked me where I would want them to place my statue, I said I wanted it to stand between the figures of Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson, Asha Bhosle, Superstar singer from India, on what she told the Madame Russaaud people in London on the day her statue, only the second from a woman from her country, was unveiled,as published on INDIARV's online website on October 2, 1917.\n\n\n\nElvis Presley is the pivotal figure in our story about a spectacular house where everything is questioned to subvert the traditional view of private space, which becomes a stage.' Alberto Biagetti, commentong on the Atelier which bears his name's forthcoming exhibit which challenges the idea of domestic space while painting a psychological portrait of a generation whose most private moments are not private at all, and as published in Wallpaper's April 17, 2023 edition.\n\n\n\nElvis Was A Democrat Joe Biden's ad, as circulated before the 2020 Presidential election.\n\n\n\nIntensity of communication, emotion, how the fusion of poetry is related to me as a listener. I'm disappointed by the bland and perfect vocal accomplishment, which I hear on so many recordings. Which is not to say that classical singers shouldn't try to become vocally masterful. I take my cue more and more from good pop singers. The other day I was looking at an early concert of Elvis Presley. It was fascinating to watch, the body language, the vocal suppleness Conor Biggs, Irish bass/baritone and classical singer, a founding member of Psallentes, a Gregorian chant ensemble, explaining to Michael Dervan, of the Irishman, for tips he looks for in a recital, as a way to better communicate with a listener, as published on that paper on February 1, 2013\n\n\n\nIn late 1959, Ibn Saud, the then King of Saudi Arabia. was spending time in Germany for medical reasons. One of his sons was a huge Elvis admirer, giving him a precious garment with golden applications, a waterpipe and a tea set with the royal crest on it, as a thank you gesture for his having left the Grunwald Hotel so that his father and his entire entourage could make total use of it. Soon after posing with the garment for the King's son at his newly rented house on #14 Goethestrasse, his friend and fellow GI Charlie Hodge had a zany idea: why couldn't he go out and walk in front of the German people, or anyone, for that matter, using the garment so as not to be recognized. This was finally done on February 1960, as he took a cab to the \"Mainzer Karneval\", a big public party, staying there for 3 days in the nearby town of Mainz which was not far from Bad Nauheim. And nobody noticed the by then Sgt Elvis Presley, in spite of him being accompanied by Hodge, plus two bodyguards all dressed as sailors as well as by a mysterious girl from Bad Nauheim, who did the translations. Elvis joined the whole programme, the clubs, the pubs, the bars, parades but stayed sober. The others did not, LOL. but they all returned safe, late at night. As published by BILD, Germany's highest selling tabloid, in an article published in March of 1960.\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/1957_Chevrolet_Bel_Air_Sport_Sedan_-_front_left.jpg/220px-1957_Chevrolet_Bel_Air_Sport_Sedan_-_front_left.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg/50px-Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Elvis_Presley-_Billboard_ad_1956.png/220px-Elvis_Presley-_Billboard_ad_1956.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/LVMPD_Electra_Glide_on_Lone_Mountain_Rd_During_Taffic_Control_%282%29.jpg/220px-LVMPD_Electra_Glide_on_Lone_Mountain_Rd_During_Taffic_Control_%282%29.jpg", "https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://en.wikiquote.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/50px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Elvis%27_tomb.jpg/220px-Elvis%27_tomb.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/ELVIS_light_name_-_Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_%282014-12-30_11.57.41_by_Sam_Howzit%29.jpg/220px-ELVIS_light_name_-_Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame_%282014-12-30_11.57.41_by_Sam_Howzit%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Elvis_Presley_-_TV_Radio_Mirror%2C_March_1957_01.jpg/220px-Elvis_Presley_-_TV_Radio_Mirror%2C_March_1957_01.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/President_Trump_Presents_the_Medal_of_Freedom_to_Bob_Cousy_%2848602861216%29.jpg/220px-President_Trump_Presents_the_Medal_of_Freedom_to_Bob_Cousy_%2848602861216%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Elvis_Presley_-_TV_Radio_Mirror%2C_March_1957_02.jpg/1200px-Elvis_Presley_-_TV_Radio_Mirror%2C_March_1957_02.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Elvis_Presley_promoting_Jailhouse_Rock.jpg/220px-Elvis_Presley_promoting_Jailhouse_Rock.jpg", "https://en.wikiquote.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Juliet_Prowse-Elvis_Presley_in_G.I._Blues.jpg/220px-Juliet_Prowse-Elvis_Presley_in_G.I._Blues.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Elvis_Presley_-_TV_Radio_Mirror%2C_March_1957_02.jpg/220px-Elvis_Presley_-_TV_Radio_Mirror%2C_March_1957_02.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Elvis_Presley_-_TV_Radio_Mirror%2C_March_1957_02.jpg/1200px-Elvis_Presley_-_TV_Radio_Mirror%2C_March_1957_02.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley", "title": "Elvis Presley", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.42.0-wmf.7", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Elvis_Presley_-_TV_Radio_Mirror%2C_March_1957_02.jpg/640px-Elvis_Presley_-_TV_Radio_Mirror%2C_March_1957_02.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 638}, "title": "Elvis Presley - Wikiquote", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikiquote.org", "summary": ""}
