Meet our baby girl India. She\u2019s the most beautiful, precious soul I have ever met,\" David gushed on Instagram. \"We can\u2019t wait to spend every day with you. Thank you for lightening up our lives. We love you baby India.\"\n\nThe MDLLA agent also shared his first sweet moments with his daughter in his Instagram Story. The video shows David holding India in the hospital. \"Hi, my beautiful little girl. Who's my special little girl? Who's my little burrito? Who's my little sausage?\" David says to his daughter. \"It's your birthday today, sweetheart. It's your little birthday.\"\n\nDavid in the hospital with his new bundle of joy, his baby daughter India.

David's business partner James Harris captured some fun times in the waiting room in his Instagram Story. David's brother, Michael Parnes, whose battle with a brain tumor MDLLA fans heard about on the show, was also there to meet his niece. \"So excited to hold my beautiful niece, India Parnes!\" Michael shared on Instagram. \"So proud of my sister in law @adrianabnosi and my little brother @davidbondst.\"\n\nDavid and Adrian announced that they were expecting their first child last October. \"@davidbondst and I are so excited to share with everyone that we are expecting!!\" Adrian shared along with a photo of her sonogram on Instagram. \"Feeling so incredibly blessed and overjoyed! We can't wait to meet our little munchkin.\"\n\nDavid shared the same post on Instagram and wrote that he was \"so happy and excited\" to welcome his baby girl.
