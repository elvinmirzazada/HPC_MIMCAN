Everything has come from that for me.\u201d\n\nRoberts and Moder have been married for nearly 15 years and have worked together on several films, including The Mexican, The Normal Heart and Secret in Their Eyes.\n\nBEI\n\nJulia Roberts and Danny Moder\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s comfort there, but also terror, which is a good combination,\u201d she said of working with her husband. \u201cTerror because the person I want to impress most is looking right at me.\u201d\n\nAnd when she\u2019s not working, the Pretty Woman star is at home doting on her 12-year-old twins, Hazel and Finn, and 10-year-old son, Henry.\n\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t here today, I\u2019d be in the carpool lane ferrying my kids to school,\u201d she said.\n\nOver the last few years, Roberts\u2019 dedication to her family has caused her to take a step back from acting.\n\n\u201cIf I did much less, I wouldn\u2019t be in the business at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI was saying to my husband the other day that I haven\u2019t worked in almost a year.\u201d\n\nSo how does she decide which projects to work on? The actress said she sets a high bar in her professional life.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: What Julia Roberts Thinks When She Reads Tabloid Headlines about Herself at the Grocery Store\n\n\u201cI just wait to see what comes along, as opposed to looking for it. It makes it fun and organic,\u201d she said of her outlook on taking new roles. \u201cThere\u2019s an almost unfair bar that a script has to attain for me to say, \u2018I\u2019m going to drop everything for this.\u2019 Sometimes I think, \u2018I\u2019m pretending my name is Jane and I work in a bank.\u2019 That\u2019s kinda silly\u2014I\u2019m a grown-up woman!\u201d\n\nWhile she\u2019s open to taking on a new role if the right project comes along, Roberts said she\u2019s happy with what she\u2019s achieved in her career.\n\n\u201cDeep down, we all know you can\u2019t stand on the top point of a pinnacle on your tiptoes, and not at some point lose your balance, or get tired, or say, \u2018OK somebody else take over, I have to go to the bathroom.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThere are great things I\u2019ve accomplished and I\u2019d be happy to accomplish more, of course, to impress my children and my husband,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut you know what? I\u2019ve been spoilt already.\u201d\n\nThe full interview appears in the November issue of Harper\u2019s Bazaar, on sale 6th October.", "images":
