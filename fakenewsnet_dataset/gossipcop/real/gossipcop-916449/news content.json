young niece and nephew have had to stand helplessly by and watch the double standards of pretending to protect the rights of some, but ignoring the rights of others and exposing innocent children to such appalling accusations about someone they love dearly and who has been so loving and kind to them is beyond cruel.\u201d\n\nRelated: As trial nears, Bill Cosby says racism could be a factor\n\nThe elder Cosby has denied the allegations.\n\nDespite her father\u2019s fame, Ensa Cosby led a life away from the spotlight.\n\nShe is one of five children born to the superstar actor and his wife,
