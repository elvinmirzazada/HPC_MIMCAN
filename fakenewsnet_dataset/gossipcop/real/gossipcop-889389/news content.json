Melissa Gorga proves she's not taking any you-know-what this season with her one-liner: \"Don't try to bully me, because I'm a boss.\" Rookie Jackie Goldschneider is keeping count with her witty tagline: \"I have four kids, two degrees, and one kickass life.\" Dolores Catania shows her softer side with her statement: \"I may put up a tough front, but I'll never leave you behind,\" while the other newcomer Jennifer Aydin shares her interests in a most succinct manner. \"I'm obsessed with family, traditions, and Chanel.\"\n\nAnd, as Zen as ever, Teresa Giudice has this to say: \"These days, I don't throw punches.
