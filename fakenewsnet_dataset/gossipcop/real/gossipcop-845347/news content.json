Rowling\n\nTo say the Harry Potter book series and ensuing movie, toy, and general marketing franchise took the world by storm would be an understatement of enormous proportions.\n\nThe novels, seven in all released between 1997 and 2007, have sold over 400 million copies across 67 languages. That alone would have brought great wealth to their author, J.K. Rowling, but the ensuing related merchandise and film franchise pushed the value of the Harry Potter brand to over $15 billion.\n\nMore than a little bit of that wealth found its way back to J. K. Rowling who, in the process, became the world\u2019s first person to become a billionaire by way of their fiction writing career. Her stint as a billionaire didn\u2019t last for long though; between the high tax rate in the UK and Rowling\u2019s donation of so much money to charity, she quickly lost her status as a billionaire.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20150320163123im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?c1=2&c2=6035753&c3=6035753&c4=http://www.howtogeek.com&c5=Technology - News&c6=&c15=&cv=1.3&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150320163123im_/http://www.howtogeek.com/pagespeed_static/1.JiBnMqyl6S.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150320163123im_/http://www.howtogeek.com/public/images/trivia200.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150320163123im_/http://www.howtogeek.com/public/images/blank.gif.pagespeed.ce.Ulei5-zhiK.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20150320163123im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-e1gWzoEHleH1I.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150320163123im_/http://www.howtogeek.com/public/images/trivia200.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20150320163123/http://www.howtogeek.com/trivia/the-first-author-to-become-a-billionaire-was/", "title": "The First Author To Become A Billionaire Was?", "meta_data": {"pocket-site-verification": "c9d41bc0af66842431541dad88464e", "fb": {"page_id": 65878196434}, "verify-v1": "WiU7236KQY8e6jcxePbZscPXDuMvJ3b9ydseGd4G5AE=", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "REVISIT-AFTER": "1 DAYS", "og": {"title": "Geek Trivia: The First Author To Become A Billionaire Was?", "type": "article", "description": "Think you know the answer?
