News, and the campaign photoshoot served as the perfect opportunity for the reality star to copy her mother's signature look.\n\nIn the campaign shots for the brand, Kylie wears a swimsuit and a short black pixie crop, making her look the spitting image of her mother, Kris.\n\nHowever, this isn't the first time the reality star has taken her mother's style for inspiration, having worn the 61-year-old's vintage thong Chanel swimsuit while playing in the pool last summer.\n\nShe also famously wore her mother's retro pink Body Glove swimsuit for her 18th birthday in Mexico in 2015.\n\nPosting a picture of her daughter in her fuchsia pink swimsuit, Kris took to Instagram and jokingly threatened to ground her daughter for borrowing her swimwear without asking.\n\n'Ohhhhhh so THIS is where my vintage Body Glove bathing suit went!!!! @kyliejenner you are grounded! Wait, i can't do that anymore you're 18....#whoworeitbetter.'\n\nWith a love of mixing up her hairstyles with rainbow wigs and boxer braids, perhaps a pixie crop might Kylie's next pick for a style make-over?\n\nThe QUAYXKYLIE collection will be available 11 July .", "images":
