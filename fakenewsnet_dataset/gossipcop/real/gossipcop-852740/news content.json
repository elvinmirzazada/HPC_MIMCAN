Though Bella had hoped to deliver Birdie naturally, after 22 hours of labor, she needed a cesarean section because of her strong abs, her twin sister Nikki Bella revealed to E! News.\n\n\u201cShe tried to go natural, and it was like eight or 10 hours into it, [she] had to get an epidural and then in the end had to get a c-section,\u201d the Total Divas star said during the Fox Upfronts red carpet Monday, where she appeared with her fianc\u00e9, fellow wrestling star John Cena.\n\n\u201cHer abs were too tight!\u201d adds Nikki, 33. \u201cGo figure. Leave it to the WWE Superstar, abs too tight!\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

I mean, it\u2019s definitely a struggle for women in the beginning, and it should be.\u201d\n\nContinues Nikki, \u201cI saw what they put their bodies through, and oh my gosh! I give all the moms in the world so much credit. That is not easy, labor. I think it takes, minimum, a week to heal from that.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Oprah Walks Through Her Average Daily Menu During Her 42.5 Pound Weight Loss\n\nBrie shared an Instagram post from the hospital two days after Birdie\u2019s arrival (she was born May 9 \u2014 over a week after her due date!).\n\n\u201cThe greatest feeling in the world!!! Can\u2019t even express the love I feel for her,\u201d Brie captioned the family hospital photo. \u201cFrom the moment I saw her I was in love.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cThank you all for your love and support. Birdie Joe is her Daddy\u2019s mini me!! #Imfinallyamommy #greatestlove #motherhood.\u201d\n\nIn April, the then-mama-to-be told Fit Pregnancy and Baby that she was ready for the pain of childbirth, but she was keeping in mind that every pregnancy is different.\n\n\u201cEveryone can tell you what pregnancy feels like, but it will still be new to you,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m preparing for a natural birth. I hope I can stick with that, but obviously I\u2019m open to medical help if need be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I can stand pain because of my career,\u201d Brie added. \u201cChildbirth is going to be more painful than wrestling, but I know I will survive.\u201d", "images":
