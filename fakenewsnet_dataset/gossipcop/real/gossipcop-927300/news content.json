Per Entertainment Tonight Canada, the star revealed in a new interview that Blake has inspired a number of the songs she\u2019s planning to sing when she heads to Sin City in June, as well as helping her to choose a number of aspects of the shows, including when it came to picking out the dancers.\n\n\u201cObviously, he\u2019s my best friend, so I\u2019m bouncing stuff off him all the time,\u201d Stefani revealed this week of involving the country superstar and The Voice coach in her residency shows.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of those people in my life that\u2019s super supportive and gets me motivated,\u201d Gwen said of the country singer, who she\u2019s been dating for more than two years. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole bunch of songs about him in the show, so that\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nGwen then revealed that she would send Blake videos and updates of how show planning is going, even sending him videos of the dancers so he could see them.\n\n\u201cLike anybody with their best friend, we share everything together,\u201d the mom-of-three said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him, \u2018I picked my dancers! There were 500 girls that tried out!\u2019 and I\u2019ll send him videos.\u201d\n\nStefani, who was recently spotted spending a sweet family Mother\u2019s Day with Shelton and her three kids at church, also revealed in the new interview that fans hoping for new music probably shouldn\u2019t keep their hopes up, as she said that she knows she\u2019s nearing the end of her music career that first began way back in 1986 as a member of the band No Doubt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously at the end of my journey of being a musician\u2026 because of my age, and I\u2019ve been doing it for thirty-something years,\u201d she said, suggesting that she may soon be ready to retire from music.\n\nGwen added, \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for me to be able to do a Vegas show because not only does it work for me as a mom, but it also works creatively.\u201d\n\nStefani also referred to how her divorce from her former husband, Gavin Rossdale, inspired her last album, This Is What The Truth Feels Like, and its accompanying tour. She called her divorce from the rocker an \u201cunexpected life crisis\u201d after 14 years of marriage.\n\n\u201cI did my last tour because I had this unexpected life crisis and then the music came pouring out of me from that,\u201d she said of her split with the musician, but noted that touring all the time just isn\u2019t \u201crealistic\u201d for her as a mom. \u201cIt was such a lifesaver and a beautiful moment for me to be able to write again. I put that tour on at the last minute and went on a summer tour with the kids.\u201d\n\nAs reported by Daily Mail, Stefani announced her Las Vegas residency during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in April. She told the daytime talk show host at the time that she was feeling pretty \u201cnervous\u201d about her new gig, but will also be doing her bit for charity through ticket sales.\n\n\u201cI feel really nervous about it, but really excited,\u201d Stefani revealed. \u201cEvery ticket that I sell for this show, one dollar is going for Cure for Kids, which is a local Vegas charity. It just feels good.\u201d\n\nGwen was then joined by boyfriend Blake for her big welcome to Las Vegas in April.\n\nE! Online reported that Shelton could be spotted cheering on and supporting his girlfriend at an event welcoming her to the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, where she\u2019ll be performing her residency show, titled \u201cJust A Girl.\u201d\n\nGwen\u2019s Just A Girl Las Vegas residency shows will begin on June 27.", "images": ["https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/inquisitr_cross.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v3/assets/search-icon.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Hutchinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4908497/gwen-stefani-sing-whole-bunch-of-songs-about-blake-shelton-during-las-vegas-residency", "title": "Gwen Stefani Will Sing \u2018A Whole Bunch Of Songs\u2019 About Blake Shelton During Las Vegas Residency", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Gwen Stefani is admitting that her boyfriend, Blake Shelton, will play a big role in her upcoming Las Vegas residency.
