The feeling is that dad never recovers or gets over this.\u201d\n\nTodd also appeared with Julie in the clip, which you can see below.\n\nMy heart! Love these two munchkins!

He\u2019s my best friend and without him I couldn\u2019t have made it happen. He loves all of the pieces I have in the line. I just love all the fabrics and so does he. So he\u2019s extremely happy with it.\u201d\n\nLeave your thoughts about Chrisley Knows Best in the comments below.\n\n[Featured Image by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/inquisitr_cross.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v3/assets/search-icon.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bernadette Giacomazzo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4375756/chrisley-knows-best-star-julie-chrisley-connects-with-late-brother-on-hollywood-medium-ghost-apologizes", "title": "\u2018Chrisley Knows Best\u2019 Star Julie Chrisley Connects With Late Brother On \u2018Hollywood Medium,\u2019 Ghost Apologizes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The stars of Chrisley Knows Best have been in the news for all the right &#8212; and all the wrong &#8212; reasons as of late, and they&#8217;re back in the news again today for a much different (albeit interesting) reason.
