Now, they're putting those red carpet outfits up for auction to benefit the movement's legal defense fund. The initiative was announced Wednesday by Time's Up, eBay, and Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2014Glamour's parent company\u2014who are teaming up to run the auction taking place this Friday.\n\nTracee Ellis Ross in Marc Jacobs\n\n\"We\u2019re thrilled that actors and others in the entertainment industry are leading in this extraordinary way to end the scourge of workplace sexual harassment,\u201d said Fatima Goss Graves, the President and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which is in charge of Time's Up's legal defense fund. \u201cEach time they\u2019ve stepped up they\u2019ve inspired more attorneys to join the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund and more individuals to contribute.\"\n\nThe black dresses and tuxedos were donated by the designers, who include Versace, Vera Wang, Armani, Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, and many others, and all money raised will be donated to the Time's Up legal defense fund. The outfits will be available for bidding starting January 19, here, with the auction running through January 26.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/654ae710ea1e5e755db96b1e/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a5e8f7ef8217e384fe98392/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Laura%2520Dern.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a5e8f3992b6a920e75fce47/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Tracee%2520Ellis%2520Ross.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a5e8ecb92b6a920e75fce45/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-16%20at%206.42.36%20PM.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6532e17b10d6f0a8a841f689/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a5e8a478d00c5554c78141b/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-902352112.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a5e8f525091ec43bd1eccdb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Dakota%2520Johnson.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_image.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_800%2Cq_80%2Cw_800/v1699443536/glamour_woty-2023-replay.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6549259d6a1208810937dc3c/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a5e8ecb92b6a920e75fce45/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-16%20at%206.42.36%20PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Evelyn Wang"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/stars-auctioning-off-2018-golden-globes-outfits-timesup", "title": "Hollywood Stars Are Auctioning Off Their Golden Globes Outfits for #TimesUp", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Starting January 19, Cond\u00e9 Nast and eBay will be auctioning off black outfits from the 2018 Golden Globes to benefit Time's Up's legal defense fund.", "id": "5a5e8a472c6d93034067f9e7", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a5e8a472c6d93034067f9e7", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Starting January 19, Cond\u00e9 Nast and eBay will be auctioning off black outfits from the 2018 Golden Globes to benefit Time's Up's legal defense fund.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a5e8f105091ec43bd1eccd9/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-16%20at%206.40.44%20PM.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a5e8f105091ec43bd1eccd9/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-16%20at%206.40.44%20PM.png\"}", "og": {"description": "Here's how you can bid on looks worn by Reese, Tracee, Dakota, and more.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a5e8ecb92b6a920e75fce45/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-16%20at%206.42.36%20PM.png", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Hollywood Stars Are Auctioning Off Their Golden Globes Outfits for #TimesUp", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/stars-auctioning-off-2018-golden-globes-outfits-timesup"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-01-17T13:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-17T13:00:00.000Z", "author": "Evelyn Wang"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Here's how you can bid on looks worn by Reese, Tracee, Dakota, and more.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a5e8ecb92b6a920e75fce45/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-16%20at%206.42.36%20PM.png?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Hollywood Stars Are Auctioning Off Their Golden Globes Outfits for #TimesUp"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a5e8ecb92b6a920e75fce45/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202018-01-16%20at%206.42.36%20PM.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516194000.0, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
