Her name was Sister Cathy Cesnik. She was a beloved 26-year-old teacher at the local Archbishop Keough High School, and her death left the community confounded: Who would want to hurt this woman? Decades later, the case is still unsolved\u2014but the circumstances around it have grown wild and complex, with police desperate to determine if Cesnik\u2019s death had anything to do with a major sexual abuse scandal at the school. What did she know? And who, ultimately, used that information against her?\n\nThe mysterious murder is coming to light this spring thanks to Netflix, which is releasing a seven-part docu-series about Cesnik\u2019s death titled The Keepers. A new trailer, released on People, is giving true-crime fans a first look at the series, and is already striking an ominous, conspiratorial tone.\n\nThe trailer\u2019s main action is led by locals who knew Sister Cathy, particularly two former students who have never stopped trying to solve the devastating murder. After Cesnik\u2019s death, many quickly linked her case to the alleged covered-up sexual-abuse scandal by priest Father Joseph Maskell, who was accused of sexually abusing dozens of school girls. He later paid settlements to his accusers, per People.\n\nBut two of the accusers, Jean Wehner and Teresa Lancaster, decided to participate in the Netflix documentary, directed by Ryan White. The series digs into the allegations, attempting to untangle the dark web Maskell\u2014whom White describes as a \u201csociopath\u201d\u2014allegedly weaved, and trying to bring to light all the insidious participants who helped him get away it.\n\n\u201cThis is a story of accountability and, at best, dozens of people and institutions dropped the ball and didn\u2019t protect children and adults,\u201d White tells People. \u201cAt worst, dozens of people and institutions covered things up so it could never be brought to light or were directly involved in crimes.\u201d\n\nHe adds that while many of the alleged perpetrators, including Maskell, died before being brought to justice, \u201cthere are people still alive who I do believe need to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nTrue-crime stories have always been at the forefront of pop culture, but there\u2019s been a boom in recent years, thanks to the explosive success of podcasts like Serial, HBO\u2019s series The Jinx, and Netflix\u2019s own Making a Murderer. However, retelling crime stories often presents a problem when it comes to finding a fitting ending. Serial, for example, had an amazing run, but ended on a \u201cYou be the judge\u201d note that left many grasping for a more concrete finale. But though White was never focused on solving the murder of Sister Cathy, he feels strongly that the ending of this docu-series, unlike many true crime stories before it, will be promising: \u201cI finished this project thinking this murder can be solved.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f7866db5598f0e6b9257f9/1:1/pass/netflix-ratings-orange-is-the-new-black.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ac9875f114d3ca724a0db7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/the-crown-julian-broad-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655d19f37116186efa302dc5/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660159ee60bb2d438ba5ff/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5e85ff953aecc6000911959e/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/656510d0affa7b4408631071/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6553ae4223927aad8fa808b3/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65543ae811ce5d97f99787c5/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654138311fa6853d9a566022/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6543ef81af9357211c5844fb/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ac9875f114d3ca724a0db8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/the-crown-julian-broad-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6564cb9e766ac2eb76f98953/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fe7af0987db7065a9e93f4/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ac98767a51b09e1bf347f7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/the-crown-julian-broad-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cbeea365c51404f08418aa/1:1/pass/netflix-algorithm-obsessed.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f7a12fd30c374e9109f64a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cath.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f4de011602613884c2301b/1:1/pass/t-the-keepers-netflix.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f7a12fd30c374e9109f64a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cath.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Yohana Desta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/netflix-the-keepers-trailer", "title": "Your Next Netflix True Crime Obsession Might Actually Have a Satisfyin", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "What ever happened to Sister Cathy?
