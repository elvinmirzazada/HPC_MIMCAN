She concluded the performance by lying backward onto the fluffy instrument.\n\nBe sure to check out PEOPLE\u2019s full Grammys coverage to get the latest news on music\u2019s big night.\n\nJust hours before the show, Gaga shared a touching message on social media about how she was hoping to transform the \u201cdeep grief\u201d that inspired Joanne into \u201chope and healing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have carried a deep grief in my heart over my family\u2019s tragedy,\u201d she wrote, referring to her late aunt, Joanne Stefani Germanotta, who died of lupus complications at age 19.\n\n\u201cThe loss of Joanne affected my father so deeply that it affected me. When he cried, I cried. When he was angry, I was angry. When he was hurt, I hurt,\u201d she continued.\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page.

After 10 years with you I still get nervous before the Grammys, but I know I have an angel with me.\u201d\n\nGaga, who is nominated for best pop solo performance and best pop vocal album in addition to taking the stage, had previously shared how \u201chonored\u201d she felt to be performing from her deeply personal album at the award show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so honored to be singing from #Joanne,\u201d she wrote on Saturday, adding, \u201cThis album and moment with [my] little monsters means so much to me.\u201d\n\nThough the pop star was born nearly 12 years after Joanne\u2019s death, she remains one of Gaga\u2019s biggest influences.\n\n\u201cWhen Mark and I wrote it, the decision to name the album that was in tribute to my father\u2019s sister who died when she was 19,\u201d she told Beats 1\u2019s Zane Lowe of her poet/painter aunt in September 2016, one month before her album\u2019s release.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Here\u2019s the List of Nominees for the 2018 Grammy Awards\n\nShe went on to reveal that the album encompassed \u201ceverything about Joanne, which also happens to be my middle name.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the toughness of the pain of losing her that made us all strong and made us who we are,\u201d Gaga added. \u201cShe is the woman of my past who is becoming and helping me bring more of my honest woman self into the future.\u201d\n\nThe singer, 31, was among the first celebrities to arrive on the red carpet at Madison Square Garden, and she was a standout in a custom Armani Priv\u00e9 black lace, long-sleeved jumpsuit, plus a dramatic black skirt with a high leg slit and statement train that according to eye-witnesses on the carpet, required three people to carry.\n\nJamie McCarthy/Getty\n\nThe singer accessorized her look with statement danglers and an engagement-like pink diamond ring (surrounded by a halo of smaller white diamonds on a gold band) that she\u2019s been seen wearing for the last few months. And while the star has not announced any engagement news, she was seen out with boyfriend Christian Carino on Saturday ahead of the awards show.\n\nIn addition, the singer accented her all-black look with a white rose to show solidarity in the movement against sexual harassment and assault.\n\nThe 60th annual Grammy Awards, hosted by James Corden, were broadcast live on CBS from Madison Square Garden in New York City.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/rvqQEbkwaPtCmMrKVDudg9wUaos=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(494x389:496x391)/cher-13-d72fb95a7c9b462c80577cabed455a41.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/V9_7ktaIkE8B6JxxPN3o7Zx1WUE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x19:736x21)/lady-gaga-tiktok-051923-fb4a3c6e5626412aa44c7fa9344808a8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/F-v_epylqrg7cFZuMOx01dtHo84=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x169:721x171)/lady-gaga-family-030823-1-95b45dcaeefb465cbd7ec4affd18b243.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/_YHRj8MLrFYcYhbRKgy88Wd1q4g=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(554x199:556x201)/lady-gaga-hold-my-hand-oscars-031223-da4d0d7a202c476f9a4a3f6e9318a267.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/E4kGR3Z76780cDga6__U3iZCN_g=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/rihanna-oscar-outfit-change-031423-b43dea92eb094fb2ae7387d60ec0665a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/dHyTULuWd-Vp7GWypxIW_VpV0fg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x29:736x31)/lady-gaga-butt-dress-oscars-031223-b48c839043264c58bf681ccc0a8f0e5f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Yo8hN_2b8uWXZuyBHn6y_LTthPM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(731x271:733x273)/bebe-rexha-062123-77917a4cd86b411889a3be648f8dd1aa.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rR9xtnlub3IFXN7vScJw47pvfM0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x679:961x681)/harry-styles-gets-msg-banner-for-15-consecutive-nights-092222-4-6798e0fbaac749bdb60b346a9c52fc8f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3ZJ0IGJZ3COeRXVtujyzBGhQl3w=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Lady-Gaga-Appointed-as-Co-Chair-of-President-Bidens-Arts-and-Humanities-Committee-041423-f5fcf0e3d630430d83a01886572b5a58.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/o6Gx-gQ7j4ml4FGvOUovDner-L0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(373x0:375x2)/lady-gaga9-977cf987cb3b4185b5e2ead8146fc9b3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/FXKib_ITUxe8Qx1opVLn_Zm3Sv0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(614x0:616x2)/gaga21-1-2000-8c7866b753464bc4b11c5e8555809b58.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/GeJ-txssA1G3Dp5ToKHCwVFm5mY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kirstie-alley-regretted-wearing-bikini-on-oprah-120622-5b5f6b1cfd244a668c463946e06840a7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/LIZ2cD1RZJNnTNxmGu8dgVuWVsQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(344x299:346x301)/Lady-Gaga-Rehearses-tiktok-01-031623-44d9d77e6a4348f9b31d98c59b6ed240.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/JEK84ZGX_SPtzWmw93Kf2E01wTc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x539:1001x541)/lady-gaga-805404b8617f4be7ae3f7ae27ca8490a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/DLl_dR9Hq1MQZtF0dxrH0Wo5k54=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x139:721x141)/lizzo-grammys-performance-020523-2-6da51a13d31a4dcfb7d49ccef344dcbe.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/OaFzPItEWZzSslyDlfIuxCR6rjE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(742x405:744x407)/Britney-Spears-Michael-Jackson-split-062423-73518c8bffac429cb00283bdf9721b14.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/U9TFaPWNIM2j-6fThBgXZ7VTCHA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(741x272:743x274)/Lady-Gaga-061723-split-74fef2ecd54c40f0983c8aae8e2fc8d6.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/o6Gx-gQ7j4ml4FGvOUovDner-L0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(373x0:375x2)/lady-gaga9-977cf987cb3b4185b5e2ead8146fc9b3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Staff Editor For Human Interest S Digital Vertical At People.
