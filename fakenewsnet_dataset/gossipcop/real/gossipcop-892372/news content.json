She also tagged Adams in the Instagram image.\n\nIn defense of her accessory, Hyland captioned the pic with a lyric from Taylor Swift's new song, \"Call It What You Want,\" off her upcoming Reputation album.\n\n\"Call it what you want ? #notbecauseheownsme,\" she wrote.\n\nThe Modern Family star -- who's a self-proclaimed fan of Bachelor Nation -- seems to be keeping a sense of humor about her rumored relationship with Adams.\n\nAfter the two dressed up together for Halloween and shared some cuddly photos on Instagram, one of Hyland's fans dug up a tweet from 2012, in which she wrote: \"Those who think I have a thing for any of the guys on The Bachelorette, think again and stop reading into things I say! I'm simply a fan.\"\n\nOn Monday, Hyland re-posted her tweet from over five years ago, and admitted that she found it humorous. \"Whoever went five years back in time to find this, thank you,\" she quipped. \"Havin' a real good laugh at the moment ?.\"\n\nAlso this week, a source told ET that Hyland and Adams are in fact dating, and that they've been talking for a few months.\n\nHyland split from her boyfriend of two years, Shadowhunters star Dominic Sherwood, in August, while Adams was rumored to be dating fellow Bachelor in Paradise star Danielle Maltby, but denied the claims to ET in September.\n\nHere's more on the 33-year-old reality star's relationship status:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fsarah_hyland_wells_adams_halloween_102817_intagram_0.jpg%3Fh%3D4acce965&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2020-07/1280katedax.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2Fsarah_hyland_848752196.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2Fsarah_hyland_wells_adams.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/sarah_hyland_wells_adams.jpg?h=c673cd1c"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/sarah_hyland_wells_adams.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/sarah-hyland-wears-wells-adams-initial-necklace-after-being-inspired-taylor-swift-song-90694", "title": "Sarah Hyland Wears Wells Adams' Initial on Necklace After Being Inspired by Taylor Swift Song", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/sarah_hyland_wells_adams.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 'Modern Family' star quoted the singer's \"Call It What You Want\" track.", "title": "Sarah Hyland Wears Wells Adams' Initial on Necklace After Being Inspired by Taylor Swift Song", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/sarah-hyland-wears-wells-adams-initial-necklace-after-being-inspired-taylor-swift-song-90694", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 'Modern Family' star quoted the singer's \"Call It What You Want\" track.", "twitter": {"description": "The 'Modern Family' star quoted the singer's \"Call It What You Want\" track.", "title": "Sarah Hyland Wears Wells Adams' Initial on Necklace After Being Inspired by Taylor Swift Song", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/sarah-hyland-wears-wells-adams-initial-necklace-after-being-inspired-taylor-swift-song-90694", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/sarah_hyland_wells_adams.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Sarah Hyland Wears Wells Adams' Initial on Necklace After Being Inspired by Taylor Swift Song  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Sarah Hyland, Taylor Swift", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
