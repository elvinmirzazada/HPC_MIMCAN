I have the largest implants they actually make, but it doesn\u2019t look that big on my body because of just the way I\u2019m built,\u201d she shared. \u201cBut, I\u2019m thinking about actually getting my boobs reduced.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already called Dr. Hochstein, who did my boobs and tummy a few years ago \u2014 he did my hernia repair and my tummy tuck after that, you might as well! And I said, \u2018You know, I feel like I should get my boobs reduced. They\u2019re heavy, my posture\u2019s terrible, I\u2019m getting older.\u2019 What do you guys think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thinking of going from like a DD to like a C. So head on over to my Instagram please and vote: DD or C,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve actually already had my surgery scheduled in a couple months, but I can always change that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a lift and I have like the nicest boobs ever. I did breastfeed all of my kids, so ladies, let\u2019s be honest, they were stretched out, loss of volume, pancake nipples,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo [Dr. Hochstein] gave me back my 18-year-old chest, which was amazing. He\u2019s the best for that you guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo anyways, let me know. I\u2019m thinking like a C, a full C. I have to have all my clothes altered. I have to buy a size 6 in everything when I could wear a size 2 in tops because of my boobs and then have everything altered. So it\u2019d be nice to just be able to wear something. They\u2019re perky because I had a lift, so it\u2019s not really that, it\u2019s just the weight of them,\u201d said Zolciak-Biermann\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kelly Dodd Opens Up About Cosmetic Procedures: \u201cNo Pain, No Gain!\u201d\n\nThe Bravo star has been very open about her relationship with plastic surgery in the past, including documenting her breast augmentation on her Bravo reality show.\n\n\u201cI will always nip and tuck if I feel the need to do so\u201d Zolciak-Biermann told E! News in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m open about it. I don\u2019t care. You only go around one time, and I especially understand that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a boob job and I\u2019ve had a hernia fixed,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann explained. \u201cI had a pretty big hernia from the twins, so I said just do a tummy tuck, which is kinda the same thing, just make the skin really tight. But that doesn\u2019t change my size. I\u2019m the same size I was the day I walked into surgery, I\u2019m just a little bit tighter looking.\u201d\n\nAt the time, she also explained that her tiny frame runs in the family.\n\n\u201cA lot is genetics,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom\u2019s very small, I\u2019m tall, I\u2019m 5-8, I do have height on me. My mom is 5-4. But my mom\u2019s been a size 2 her whole life. I\u2019ve been a size 27 jean my whole life.\u201d", "images":
