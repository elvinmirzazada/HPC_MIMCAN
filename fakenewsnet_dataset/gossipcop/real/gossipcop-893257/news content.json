I will love you more and more everyday Until the end of time \u265a.\"\n\nBut of course, the internet being the internet, Khlo\u00e9's followers decided to leave some pretty unnecessary/rude comments rather than bask in the mother/daughter love, and Khlo\u00e9 was NOT having it.\n\nFirst, a user commented, \"would you keep IG if all photo editing apps were gone forever??? Lol.\" Khlo\u00e9 responded with, \"would you? Sometimes I wonder why people comment if it adds no value to ones life? Maybe I'm just different...but I don't care to be negative or passive aggressive. Our world is toxic enough as it is. It's sad people care to criticize something like an editing app. Let it go babes. Say something nice or just let it go. How does this serve you love?\"\n\nInstagram\n\nAnd because that wasn't enough, another user decided to take it on themselves to remind Khlo\u00e9 that she also had a brother, as if that's something that she would forget. The person commented, \"It's a shame Rob Kardashian is a member of the family and he is NEVER mentioned!!!\"\n\nKhlo\u00e9's reply? \"my bother is my entire world! He is definitely a king \ud83d\udc51 it is a shame that can respect us for respecting his privacy. You should not comment if you truly aren't informed about our family.\"\n\nInstagram\n\nHow many times will this happen before trolls learn that you do NOT want to come for Khlo\u00e9\u2014she will 100% slam you for it.\n\nRelated Story Important: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Dyed Her Hair Pink", "images":
