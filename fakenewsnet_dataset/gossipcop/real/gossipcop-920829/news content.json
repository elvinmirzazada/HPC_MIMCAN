We get along very well, it\u2019s just there\u2019s a little something missing and you can\u2019t really pinpoint what it is. That\u2019s just how I feel,\u201d Iaconetti, 30, told former Bachelor star Ben Higgins on Wednesday\u2019s episode of their Ben and Ashley I. Almost Famous Podcast.\n\nWendt affirmed Iaconetti\u2019s feelings, saying, \u201cI feel like that\u2019s normal and I feel like you get those connections all the time where if you take away our outside world and just put Ashley and me on an island together, we\u2019d probably get along really well. And that\u2019s what Vermont was.\u201d\n\nWhen Higgins asked Wendt if he too was \u201cfeeling the lack of spark also\u201d with Iaconetti, he shared, \u201cI\u2019m very hard at giving up on things. And I\u2019m not saying that we gave up on it \u2026 I\u2019m saying I was still ready to come there again. And I know her birthday, I wanted to be there when I had to work and I was planning on coming out as of that week or she was going to come here. I knew we definitely had an uphill battle. I wasn\u2019t 100 percent in yet, but I also knew I wanted to see her again.\u201d\n\nLorenzo Bevilaqua/ABC\n\nHe added: \u201cBut now that a few days have passed and we both kind of collected our thoughts and emotions and stuff, I know she made the right call and I know this is the way it should be.\u201d\n\nFrom Wendt\u2019s perspective, \u201cI feel like I got friend-zoned. Ashley, you friend-zoned me,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m okay. I think the more I process it and the more \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve kept it kind of to myself. I didn\u2019t want any comments getting out there without us doing this,\u201d he said, referencing the podcast. \u201cI want the best things for Ashley. I just don\u2019t think the spark was fully ignited by the time we had the conversations, but I respect her for at least doing it earlier on. We could have done two or three more trips and then it just would kind of dragged out, so it\u2019s all good. It makes sense.\u201d\n\nDespite the split, Iaconetti said the exes ares on \u201cfriendly terms\u201d and chose to openly speak about the breakup because what she \u201cwanted to prevent was everybody\u2019s personal interpretations and all the social media picking apart.\u201d\n\nWATCH: The \u2018Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 Cast Reveal Behind-the-Scenes Secrets, Biggest Flirt and More\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t want people to make assumptions,\u201d said Iaconetti, who also noted that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want people villainizing [Kevin].\u201d\n\nSince filming wrapped, Iaconetti and Wendt were intentional about making their relationship work \u2014 including \u201ca lot of FaceTime\u201d and phone calls \u2014 despite being long distance.\n\nTo celebrate her 30th birthday last week, Wendt posted a photo of Iaconetti to Instagram with a sweet caption. \u201cShe has so many incredible qualities I\u2019m learning about each day,\u201d he began. \u201cThere is a reason she has so many friends and people around her that love her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most driven, motivating, and supportive person I know. She motivates me to be more. Smart, sweet, sexy and it\u2019s her birthday tomorrow!!\u201d continued Wendt. \u201cSo go say happy birthday to her!!! \ud83c\udf81\u2764 #30looksgood #campfireandwine.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/oRQCzUpLCrNgBTL_YOVtT9uA-YM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/ben-higgins-2-9fb3b70959384fd5ae7075e27b69935f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8MPhOopofc21U5fNZJU_7f7KOR4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(819x629:821x631)/michelle-young-nayte-olukoya-1-4432ecb6bea3447b84cdc4e8fac5dd1c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/f98iCX9gLTI3YEmTbR9TERrvBJY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/ashely-iaconetti-kevin-2000-0eb6aa98058e449db1c1019550572c02.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lAUjgx2gZISAZgLdpJEhrjCjEfU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/ashley-i-kevin-b796139e7c2f46b4abb0fe259b9ddd83.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/sfKCnZy7pVcaP1n-_OP9boW5IJs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(878x212:880x214)/zach-shallcross-the-bachelor-012323-558485115b2248fd8aea3fe477d73487.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZeJPcmtpX4_sdU1RiiMUyKUXdic=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(670x0:672x2)/michelle-young-1-da64cb4a66784621a8d5754a18243855.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/u_Yw2Dcy6Mn0yV2lrn-N5myW-2E=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(659x299:661x301)/ashley-iaconetti-jared-haibon-bachelor-in-paradise-guest-role-criticism-101922-2-5147cdbd2a1047c18863edc92506879f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZC0KqSZ-CoS-fJOn7j3526YQKME=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Kevin-Wendt-and-Astrid-Loch-wedding-49-28102022-dcb28c4b59b7466183753f442db48703.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/bC3GlVYZ1GaUvyrpfXcRRGnDLlM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(879x519:881x521)/ashley-iaconetti-jared-haibon-1-d8874bb0cc9e4d3fba6dd80f52826776.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qG4xOvpxEMOicyU6QcWnoTdvy98=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x159:751x161)/Ashley-Iaconetti-Kevin-Wendt-c7031e948f68448ca97d9908909051be.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/a4TPyUrB_y7JJ_uOGw__c9fYiNU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(545x399:547x401)/matt-james-rachel-kirkconnell-1-6898c0adbbb849b6842da6e34d629d39.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/oxCJyuhpUXaEw3HASS5GF6uHQLI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x369:721x371)/chris-harrison-9faf4bf93643412d818ed17419cb63b5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rhWpTGm4rYYtR2OhFcLJG322b2w=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(489x224:491x226)/ashley-iaconetti-bachelorette-080822-ff01856867ab410a81715bba161e50f5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/P5bydWU-q4zwFuYGREWLdDXR5oo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x519:721x521)/KEVIN-WENDT-72c53c94678a4e64a1d8568a68273e13.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NKeXk6enoI-SrcysJwSXQ3CtZ8Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(692x419:694x421)/kaitlyn-bristowe-372b638a6ef94c86ae4779976435fa6b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZVtvBP_X712O1zHVUJJPAdm66So=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/jared-haibon-and-ashley-ioaconetti-cafe-2-8422-23553a827b7541e9b84b7e8b82e1a4ef.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/gu0iG64KOEV8RcRJSoEbBXwODMQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1079x509:1081x511)/dean-ulgert-caelynn-miller-keyes-1-71d04e31665442d1a31d0ecbb4c65f2b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/f98iCX9gLTI3YEmTbR9TERrvBJY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/ashely-iaconetti-kevin-2000-0eb6aa98058e449db1c1019550572c02.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-winter-games-ashley-iaconetti-and-kevin-wendt-explain-why-they-broke-up/", "title": "Ashley Iaconetti & Kevin Wendt Open Up About Split", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"I feel like I got friend-zoned.
