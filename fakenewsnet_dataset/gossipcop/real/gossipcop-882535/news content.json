Well, let me tell you, on that performance, the house is fixed and you\u2019ve become a hot commodity,\u201d Goodman remarked of the Property Brothers star, who the head judge dubbed the \u201cmost improved dancer on this show.\u201d\n\nDespite earning solid scores, Scott\u2019s three fellow contestants came out strong and earned higher overall scores: 76/80 for Frankie Muniz, 80/80 for Jordan Fisher and 80/80 for Lindsey Stirling.\n\nAfter Stirling delivered the final dance of the night, Goodman admitted that he had \u201cno clue\u201d who will take home the Mirrorball Trophy on Tuesday night\u2019s finale.\n\n\u201cThis is becoming the war on the floor because I\u2019m so excited about tomorrow evening because I have no clue who\u2019s going to win! It\u2019s just become a fantastic competition,\u201d Goodman said after Stirling performed her freestyle dance.\n\nDrew Scott/Instagram\n\nUpon being eliminated at the end of the show, Scott reflected on his time on the reality dancing competition series.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I could have done anything that I did out here without her. And it\u2019s been such a ride. Look at the amazing amazing talent,\u201d said Scott. \u201cI can\u2019t even believe I\u2019m here with these guys. Thanks to the judges and the crew and everybody, you\u2019ve made this a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with reporters after the show, Slater said of being eliminated: \u201cI feel awesome. There\u2019s nothing to be sad about here. There\u2019s no disappointment, no bittersweet. It\u2019s just sweet. We were absolutely stoked to be in the finals and looked at this week as a blessing and gave it our all. But like I said earlier, my measuring stick is completely different and no first place or Mirrorball is the be all end all. For me, it was just about getting to know this guy this entire season and making it all the way to the end \u2013 literally to the finals. We\u2019re missing out on one day, which is tomorrow and we\u2019re going to be there in full form anyway.\u201d\n\nScott said of his partner, \u201cHonestly just to be in the final four means everything. I honestly didn\u2019t think that I would make it here and it\u2019s all because of this gal right here. I couldn\u2019t thank her enough.\u201d\n\nThe season 25 Dancing with the Stars finale airs Tuesday (9 p.m. ET) on ABC.\n\n\u2014Reporting by PATRICK GOMEZ", "images":
