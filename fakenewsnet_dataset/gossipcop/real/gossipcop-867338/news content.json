He came to fame as a teen pop singer in the late 1990s, establishing himself as a star among preteen and teenage audiences during the first years of the 21st century,[3] with his four studio albums.\n\nCarter began performing at age seven, after the formation of his brother Nick's group the Backstreet Boys, and released his self-titled debut album in 1997 at age nine, selling a million copies worldwide.

I should have had at least $20 million in my account.\"[67] After he turned 18 in 2005, Carter learned that he owed $4 million in tax liens.[67] On November 22, 2013, Carter filed a bankruptcy petition to shed more than $3.5 million in debt,[68] mostly taxes owed from the money made at the height of his popularity[69] when he was a minor.[70] The petition states that Carter owed the Internal Revenue Service $1.3 million in back taxes from his income in 2003.[69] Carter claimed that his earnings had helped his parents to purchase 15 houses and 30 cars; however, he did not get any portion of profits when his parents sold the properties.[71][67] He also claimed that his father shot a .44 Magnum near his ear, which caused him to go 70% deaf in one ear, in order to coerce him into signing a $256,000 check.[71] Carter settled all of his tax debt in 2014.[72]\n\nIn February 2019, Carter purchased a home in Lancaster, California.[73]\n\nIn March 2020, Carter set up an OnlyFans account, which is popular in the adult entertainment industry, to make money.[74] Carter began charging $50 to $100 per nude photo, or $26 a month.

The series focuses on attempting to repair strained relationships through unconventional therapy.[81]\n\nIn a further appearance on The Doctors in 2019, Carter disclosed that he had been diagnosed with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.[82][83]\n\nLegal issues\n\nIn February 2008, Carter was arrested in Kimble County, Texas, when he was pulled over for speeding, and authorities found less than two ounces of marijuana in his car.[84]\n\nIn July 2017, Carter was arrested in Georgia on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana charges.[85][86] He agreed to plead no contest to reckless driving and was placed on probation and, among other conditions, was ordered to perform community service and pay $1,500 in court fees and fines.[87]\n\nIn August 2019, Carter was granted a restraining order against his ex-girlfriend, Russian model Lina Valentina, after she reportedly threatened to stab him.[88] In March 2020, his girlfriend Melanie Martin was arrested in Los Angeles following an alleged domestic violence incident against him.[89]\n\nControversies\n\nCarter had a tumultuous relationship with his siblings, and many of their feuds have played out on social media. In September 2019, Carter made allegations of sexual abuse against his sister Leslie, who died of a drug overdose in 2012, saying that the abuse began when he was ten years old and ended when he was 13, and occurred when Leslie would fail to take her prescribed medication for her bipolar disorder. He also accused his brother Nick of life-long abuse, and implied that Nick also abused a female family member.[90] Nick's legal team denied the allegations, which came after Nick and their sister Angel sought restraining orders against Carter, who reportedly confessed that he had thoughts of killing Nick's then-pregnant wife, Lauren Carter.[91][92]\n\nIn January 2020, German artist Jonas J\u00f6dicke tweeted that Carter was making unauthorized use of J\u00f6dicke's copyrighted artwork to promote merchandise.[93] Carter replied on Twitter that J\u00f6dicke \"should've taken it as a compliment\".[94] Following the incident, J\u00f6dicke was interviewed by Forbes, saying he was \"absolutely amazed\" at Carter's response.[95] In June 2021, Carter agreed to pay J\u00f6dicke $12,500.[96]\n\nIn August 2021, Carter was announced as a performer in the Las Vegas production of Naked Boys Singing!.[97] He was let go before the show's debut because he refused to be vaccinated for COVID-19.[98]\n\nDeath\n\nOn November 5, 2022, Carter died at his home in Lancaster, California, at age 34.[2] His body was found in his bathtub by a housekeeper. He was cremated, and his ashes were left in the care of his twin sister Angel.[99][100] The cause of death was not immediately publicized,[101] but the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner later ruled that Carter's death was accidental: drowning after inhaling difluoroethane and taking alprazolam.[102][103]\n\nCarter's ashes were interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).[104]\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nTours\n\nHeadlining\n\nCo-headlining\n\nOpening act\n\nPromotional\n\nEurasian Tour (1998) [114] [122]\n\nAustralian Tour (2000) [121]\n\nWal-Mart Promo Tour (2000)[121]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nTelevision", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/AwIMG_0004.jpg/220px-AwIMG_0004.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Aaron_Carter_and_Pat_SoLo_Performing_%22Ooh_Wee%22_-_Photo_by_Peter_Dzubay_%28cropped%29.png/220px-Aaron_Carter_and_Pat_SoLo_Performing_%22Ooh_Wee%22_-_Photo_by_Peter_Dzubay_%28cropped%29.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Aaron_Carter_Performing_at_the_Gramercy_Theatre_-_Photo_by_Peter_Dzubay_%28cropped_2%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Aaron_Carter_Paparazzo_07_30_2010.jpg/220px-Aaron_Carter_Paparazzo_07_30_2010.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Aaron_Carter_Performing_at_the_Gramercy_Theatre_-_Photo_by_Peter_Dzubay_%28cropped_2%29.jpg/220px-Aaron_Carter_Performing_at_the_Gramercy_Theatre_-_Photo_by_Peter_Dzubay_%28cropped_2%29.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Aaron_Carter_Performing_at_the_Gramercy_Theatre_-_Photo_by_Peter_Dzubay_%28cropped_2%29.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Carter", "title": "Aaron Carter", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.42.0-wmf.5", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Aaron_Carter_Performing_at_the_Gramercy_Theatre_-_Photo_by_Peter_Dzubay_%28cropped_2%29.jpg/640px-Aaron_Carter_Performing_at_the_Gramercy_Theatre_-_Photo_by_Peter_Dzubay_%28cropped_2%29.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 794}, "title": "Aaron Carter - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
