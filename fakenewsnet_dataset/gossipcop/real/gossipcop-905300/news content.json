The singer is honest, obsessed with her team, and packs some seriously impressive style goals to boot. During the elimination night for the Top 11, she made it even more apparent that she\u2019s her contestants' biggest fan in just one comment caught on camera.\n\nThough Sarah Grace and Kymberli Joye were saved by America\u2019s votes, Kelly\u2019s other charges, Chevel Shepherd and Lynnea Moorer, were two of the last three on the stage. Fortunately for 16-year-old Chevel\u2014who continues to stun viewers week after week\u2014host Carson Daly called her name, securing her spot in the top 10.\n\nThe Voice The Voice STREAM NOW\n\nKelly was, of course, thrilled that Chevel was moving forward, and immediately hopped up to give the young artist a big hug\u2014and some reassurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in any order,\u201d she quickly told Chevel, who fanned herself as she joined her coach. Chevel responded, \u201cOK,\u201d and then told Kelly, \u201cLove you!\u201d (See the sweet moment at 29:01 here.)\n\nKelly clearly wanted her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to understand that she shouldn\u2019t take her standing on the elimination show to mean she\u2019s in last place in the voter\u2019s hearts. And Kelly\u2019s not the only one who reached out to the talented teen to let her know she\u2019s a front-runner in the competition.\n\nSadly, Kelly didn\u2019t win all around on Tuesday. After performing Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cTattooed Heart,\u201d Lynnea (who caused quite the controversy when she joined the series from the Comeback Stage this year) was sent home, and DeAndre Nico from Team Adam Levine moved on in her place. But despite losing Lynnea, Kelly still has three powerhouse performers on her side. Blake Shelton might be calling her Queen Kelly for another year, after all!", "images":
