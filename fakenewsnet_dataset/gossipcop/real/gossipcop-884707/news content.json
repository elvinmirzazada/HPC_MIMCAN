Back in June, the pair went undercover, in full disguise, as street musicians in a New York City subway station.\n\nWhile the pair were somewhat unrecognizable, Cyrus' flawless soulful cover of Dolly Parton's \"Jolene\" attracted a lot of attention and soon the pair revealed themselves. Check out the video below for a look at the impressive stunt.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-09%2F1280_jimmy_fallon_miley_cyrus_ew_tonight_show_nbc.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2015-02%2Fset_chris_pratt_chris_evans_super_bowl_photobomb.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/miley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_photobomb_tonight_show_nbc_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fmiley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_tonight_show_youtube.jpg%3Fh%3D7b6fe0f6&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/miley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_photobomb_tonight_show_nbc_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jimmy-fallon-and-miley-cyrus-photobomb-unsuspecting-fans-adorable-tonight-show-sketch-88544", "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Miley Cyrus Photobomb Unsuspecting Fans In Adorable 'Tonight Show' Sketch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/miley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_photobomb_tonight_show_nbc_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Watching the TV host and the singer adorably surprise fans is one of the most delightful things you'll see all day.", "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Miley Cyrus Photobomb Unsuspecting Fans In Adorable 'Tonight Show' Sketch", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jimmy-fallon-and-miley-cyrus-photobomb-unsuspecting-fans-adorable-tonight-show-sketch-88544", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Watching the TV host and the singer adorably surprise fans is one of the most delightful things you'll see all day.", "twitter": {"description": "Watching the TV host and the singer adorably surprise fans is one of the most delightful things you'll see all day.", "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Miley Cyrus Photobomb Unsuspecting Fans In Adorable 'Tonight Show' Sketch", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jimmy-fallon-and-miley-cyrus-photobomb-unsuspecting-fans-adorable-tonight-show-sketch-88544", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/miley_cyrus_jimmy_fallon_photobomb_tonight_show_nbc_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Miley Cyrus Photobomb Unsuspecting Fans In Adorable 'Tonight Show' Sketch | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, , Miley Cyrus, Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
