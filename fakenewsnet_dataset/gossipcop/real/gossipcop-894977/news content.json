{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS_(band)", "text": "South Korean boy band\n\nBTS (Korean: \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit. Bulletproof Boy Scouts), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, who co-write or co-produce much of their material. Originally a hip hop group, they expanded their musical style to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyrics have focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychology, and includes an alternate universe storyline.\n\nBTS debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment with the single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. BTS released their first Korean and Japanese-language studio albums, Dark & Wild and Wake Up respectively, in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global music market and led the Korean Wave into the United States, becoming the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single \"Mic Drop\", as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018). In 2020, BTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles (in 1966\u20131968) to chart four US number-one albums in less than two years, with Love Yourself: Answer (2018) becoming the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA; in the same year, they also became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single \"Dynamite\". Follow-up releases \"Savage Love\", \"Life Goes On\", \"Butter\", and \"Permission to Dance\" made them the fastest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin Timberlake in 2006.\n\nAs of 2023 , BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history according to the Circle Chart, having sold in excess of 40 million albums.[2] Their studio album Map of the Soul: 7 (2020) is the third best-selling album of all time in South Korea, as well as the first in the country to surpass both four and five million registered sales. They are the first non-English-speaking and Asian act to sell out concerts at Wembley Stadium and the Rose Bowl (Love Yourself World Tour, 2019), and were named the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year for both 2020 and 2021. The group's accolades include multiple American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards, Golden Disc Awards, and nominations for five Grammy Awards. Outside of music, they have addressed three sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and partnered with UNICEF in 2017 to establish the Love Myself anti-violence campaign. Featured on Time's international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\" and dubbed the \"Princes of Pop\", BTS has also appeared on Time's lists of the 25 most influential people on the internet (2017\u20132019) and the 100 most influential people in the world (2019), and in 2018 became the youngest recipients of the South Korean Order of Cultural Merit for their contributions in spreading the Korean culture and language.\n\nOn June 14, 2022, the group announced a scheduled pause in group activities to enable the members to complete their mandatory South Korean military service, with a reunion planned for 2025. Jin, the oldest member, enlisted on December 13, 2022, followed by J-Hope on April 18, 2023, and Suga on September 22, 2023.\n\nName\n\nBTS stands for the Korean phrase Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean: \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8; Hanja: \u9632\u5f48\u5c11\u5e74\u5718), which translates literally to 'Bulletproof Boy Scouts'. According to member J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire \"to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets\".[3][4] In Japan, they are known as B\u014ddan Sh\u014dnendan (\u9632\u5f3e\u5c11\u5e74\u56e3).[5] In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for \"Beyond the Scene\" as part of their new brand identity.[6] This extended the meaning of their name to encompass the idea of growth \"from a boy to an adult who opens the doors that are facing forward\".[7]\n\nHistory\n\n2010\u20132014: Formation and early years\n\nBTS in 2013 performing at the Incheon Music Center\n\nBTS was formed in 2010, after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk wanted to form a hip hop group around RM (Kim Nam-joon), an underground rapper well known on the music scene in Seoul. At the time, physical album sales were on the decline and digital revenues were not yet high enough to compensate.[8] Seeing a need for diversified income streams, Bang decided to form an idol group instead, because of the potential for live concert performances and passionate support from fans of such groups. Many trainees refused to become part of an idol group, but J-Hope, RM, and Suga remained.[8] Bang chose to vary from the usual, highly regimented idol groups and create one where the members would be individuals rather than an ensemble and free to express themselves.[9] Auditions were held in 2010 with plans to launch the following year.[11][12] The band members lived together, practicing up to 15 hours a day, and first performed before a small crowd of industry insiders in 2013.\n\nWe started to tell the stories that people wanted to hear and were ready to hear, stories that other people could not or would not tell. We said what other people were feeling\u2014like pain, anxieties and worries. That was our goal, to create this empathy that people can relate to. \u2014Suga[14]\n\nBTS's representation by Big Hit, rather than one of the three agencies that dominated K-pop at the time, allowed the individual members leeway to express their individuality and have input into the music. On June 12, 2013, BTS released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, along with the lead single \"No More Dream\", neither of which sold particularly well at the time.[16] On June 13, 2013, BTS made their stage debut on M Countdown with the single, \"No More Dream\".[17] Nevertheless, according to Kathy Sprinkel in her book on BTS, that single was \"spotlighting young people's anxiety in the face of lofty parental expectations, sent shock waves through the K-pop ranks. Here was a musical act that wasn't pulling any punches. More specifically, they had a point of view, and they weren't afraid to take on topics that are considered taboo in South Korean society and elsewhere.\" The album reached the top five on South Korea's Gaon Music Chart.[19] In 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS employed an old-school hip-hop sound from the 1990s. The album's release was followed by appearances on Korean music shows, which caught the attention of reviewers and viewers.[22][23]\n\nIn September 2013, BTS released the second entry in their \"school trilogy\": the EP, O!RUL8,2?. The album was released alongside the single \"N.O.\"[24][25] Similarly to 2 Cool 4 Skool, the new release had a theme of students feeling under pressure and needing to sacrifice their dreams and aspirations.[24] According to scholar Kyung Hyun Kim, many of BTS's earlier works such as \"N.O.\" and \"No More Dreams\" were \"expressions of rebellion against the establishment that tapped into Korean teenagers' frustrations with the country's educational system\" and, he stated, helped them build a fan base among young people in North America and Europe. That same month, BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS MTV's Rookie King Channel Bangtan, in which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea.[27] At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards in South Korea.[28][29][30]\n\n2014\u20132017\n\nSkool Luv Affair and first concert tour\n\nExterior of the nightclub Troubadour (photo taken 2006) where BTS held their concert in the US for free\n\nThe last entry in BTS \"school trilogy\", the Skool Luv Affair EP, was released in February 2014.[31][32] The release topped the Gaon Album Chart,[33] and appeared on Billboard's World Albums Chart for the first time, peaking at number three.[31][34] The EP was supported by two singles: \"Boy in Luv\" and \"Just One Day\".[35] Following Skool Luv Affair's release, BTS played at their first fan meeting in Seoul, selecting the name A.R.M.Y. for the fan club.[36] In July 2014, BTS hosted a concert in West Hollywood, their first show in the United States,[37] and in August, they appeared at KCON in Los Angeles.[38]\n\nIn August 2014, BTS released the album Dark & Wild, which reached number two in South Korea.[35][39] It was supported by two singles: \"Danger\" and \"War of Hormone\".[35] The group embarked on their first concert tour, 2014 BTS Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet, which lasted from October to December 2014.[40] The band launched their first Japanese studio album, Wake Up, in December 2014; the release peaked at number three on the Oricon Albums Chart.[41] After the album's release, BTS held their 1st Japan Tour 2015 Wake Up: Open Your Eyes in February 2015.[42] The Red Bullet Tour that had begun on October 17, 2014, in South Korea was resumed on June 6, 2015, in Malaysia and toured Australia, North America and Latin America before ending in Hong Kong that August. In all, the entire tour attracted 80,000 spectators at 18 cities in 13 countries.[40][43]\n\nMainstream breakthrough and commercial success\n\nBTS experimented with other styles of music besides hip hop in The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Pt. 1, released in 2015.[35] BTS wanted to express the beauty and anxiousness of youth and settled on the title of \"\u82b1\u6a23\u5e74\u83ef\" (Korean: \ud654\uc591\uc5f0\ud654; RR : Hwayangyeonhwa), loosely interpreted to define \"youth\" metaphorically as \"the most beautiful moment in life\".[45] The album served as an introduction to their youth trilogy, a triptych of albums dedicated to the struggles of young people. The single \"I Need U\" was a top-five hit in South Korea and garnered the group a win on SBS MTV's The Show.[47][48] The second single \"Dope (Korean: \uca54\uc5b4; RR : Jjeoreo)\" reached number three on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart and its music video was viewed over 100 million times on YouTube.[49][50] The group began the world tour extension of their Red Bullet Tour in June, titled 2015 Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet, visiting cities throughout Asia, Oceania, North America, and Latin America.[40] \"For You\", in Japanese, was released together with Japanese versions of \"War of Hormone\" and \"Let Me Know\" on June 17, 2015, and immediately topped Oricon's daily chart.[35][51]\n\nBTS performing at KCON France in Paris on June 2, 2016\n\nIn November, BTS commenced their third concert tour, 2015 BTS LIVE \"The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: On Stage\", which began with three sold-out shows in Seoul, and was extended to Japan. Thematically, the EP focused more on the serious and speculative aspects of youth, touching on the pursuit of success, loneliness, affection for their origins, and the suffering of the younger generation due to unfavorable conditions in current society. The album topped the weekly Gaon Album and Billboard World Albums charts.[54][55] It also marked their first appearance on the Billboard 200 chart,[56] making it for one week at number 171,[57] and eight of the tracks appeared on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart.\n\nTheir compilation album and the finale to their \"youth trilogy\", The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever was released on May 2, 2016. With 300,000 presold copies, it included three new singles: \"Epilogue: Young Forever\", \"Fire\", and \"Save Me\",[35][60] which debuted in the top three spots on the Billboard World Digital Charts. The album topped the Gaon Album Chart in South Korea for two consecutive weeks and reached number 107 on the Billboard 200.[61][62][63] The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever won Album of the Year at the 2016 Melon Music Awards.[64] BTS embarked on their Asia tour extension, 2016 BTS LIVE \"The Most Beautiful Moment in Life On Stage: Epilogue\" from May to August 2016. Tickets for the 14 shows in 10 Asian cities sold out, some in as little as five seconds.[65]\n\nBTS win their first major Korean award for Album of the Year at the 2016 Melon Music Awards on November 19, 2016\n\nIn September 2016, BTS released their second Japanese studio album Youth.[66] The album sold 44,547 on the first day of its release, and charted 1st in the Oricon Daily Album Chart.[67][68] The album was eventually certified Gold with sales of roughly over 100,000 in Japan. It was followed one month later in October,[35] by their next studio album Wings, which combined the themes of youth presented in their previous \"youth trilogy\" with temptation and adversity. The album and its tracks, including the single \"Blood Sweat & Tears\" immediately rose to the top on eight music charts, including the Gaon Music Chart, and led the iTunes album charts in 23 countries.[71][72] Wings opened at number 26 on the Billboard 200, with 16,000 album-equivalent units in the US for the week of its release, the best week ever there for a K-pop album.[73] It became the best-selling album in Gaon Album Chart history.[74]\n\nYou Never Walk Alone and Love Yourself: Her\n\nIn February 2017, BTS released the repackaged edition of Wings entitled You Never Walk Alone. The 700,000 pre-orders of it (an increase from the 500,000 pre-orders of Wings) helped break the record for most albums sold in a month in South Korea, as it reached 1.49 million copies by the end of its first month.[75][76] The lead single was \"Spring Day\"[35] and it won Best Song of the Year at the 2017 Melon Music Awards.[77] BTS's second world tour, 2017 BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour, began in February.[78] On the tour, BTS played arenas in the US, such as New Jersey's Prudential Center and California's Honda Center. Tickets for the North American leg sold out within hours and two shows were added.[79][80] After completing the North American leg, BTS attended the 24th Billboard Music Awards in May and won Top Social Artist,[81] the first K-pop group to win a Billboard award.[82] BTS fans cast over 300 million votes for the band and broke a six-year winning streak held by Justin Bieber, a performer with 100 million Twitter followers.[83] This caused the international media to focus on the ability of BTS's fandom to propel the group to such a victory.[83]\n\nBTS at their press conference in Seoul, South Korea after winning Top Social Artist at the 24th Billboard Music Awards on May 29, 2017\n\nBTS released a remake of Seo Taiji's \"Come Back Home\" (1995) in July 2017, giving it new lyrics but maintaining the theme of urging societal change.[84] Later that year, BTS embarked on their \"Love Yourself\" album series, with theme of the enlightenment of self-love through the \"\u8d77\u627f\u8f49\u7d50\" (Korean: \uae30\uc2b9\uc804\uacb0; RR : Giseungjeongyeol) narrative sequence of \"beginning, development, turn, and conclusion.\" BTS released its first part, their fifth EP, Love Yourself: Her, on September 18.[82][86] RM considered \"DNA\", the lead single from that album,[87] as \"taking BTS to new ground. We tried to apply new grammar and perspectives.\"[35] He said of the album, \"I believe it's going to be the starting point of a second chapter of our career; the beginning of our Chapter Two.\"[88] Sonically, the EP served as \"a dual exploration of the group's electro-pop and hip-hop leanings\".[87]\n\nBTS at the 45th American Music Awards shortly before making their US television debut on November 19, 2017\n\nLove Yourself: Her debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200.[89] The album had 1,664,041 sales in May 2017 to lead the Gaon Chart,[90] and was the first in 16 years to exceed 1.2 million copies sold since g.o.d's fourth album Chapter 4 (2001).[91][92] \"DNA\" was released simultaneously with the EP, and its music video accumulated 21 million views in its first 24 hours.[93] It became BTS's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100, charting at number 85, making them the first K-pop boy band to reach that chart.[94] The single rose to number 67 the following week and became the highest-charting song on the Hot 100 for any K-pop group.[95] A remix of \"Mic Drop\" from the album, featuring Desiigner, was released as a single and peaked at number 28, the first time a K-pop group had cracked the top forty.[96][97] Both singles attained Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in early 2018.[98] \"Mic Drop\" achieved Platinum status in the US later that year.[99]\n\nIn November 2017, BTS became the first K-pop group to perform at the American Music Awards.[100][101] BTS won Artist of the Year at the 19th Mnet Asian Music Awards in December, winning for the second consecutive year.[102] They released \"DNA\" and \"Mic Drop\" together with a new song \"Crystal Snow\" as a single album in Japan on December 6, 2017, though the songs were made digitally available elsewhere.[35][103] It topped the Oricon Chart for the week of its release. It was the only album by a foreign artist to be certified Double Platinum in Japan in 2017.[104][105]\n\nLater that month, they made their Japanese television prime time music show debut on Music Station Super Live,[106] and ended the year performing on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve.[107][108]\n\nIn 2017, BTS partnered with UNICEF on the \"Love Myself\" campaign, intended to help end violence, abuse and bullying, and to promote self-esteem and well-being among young people. Both Big Hit and the group pledged money to promote the campaign, and BTS sold special \"Love Myself\" merchandise and set up dedicated booths at concert venues. The campaign was renewed in 2021, with UNICEF deeming it to have been successful.[109]\n\n2018\u20132020\n\nLove Yourself album series\n\nBTS won major awards at the Golden Disc and Seoul Music Awards in January 2018.[110][111] In March, the group premiered an eight-episode documentary titled Burn the Stage that offered a behind-the-scenes look at their 2017 Wings Tour, exclusively on YouTube Premium.[112][113] Their third Japanese studio album, Face Yourself, was released on April 4, 2018,[114] and quickly reached the top 5 of the U.S iTunes Albums chart.

Le Guin, Carl Jung, George Orwell and Nietzsche.[302] The Love Yourself series was influenced by Erich Fromm's The Art of Loving,[271][303] and their 2018 song \"Magic Shop\" from Love Yourself: Tear was inspired by James R. Doty's memoir Into the Magic Shop.[304]\n\nMusical style\n\nSince their inception, BTS have emphasized hip hop as their musical base, largely due to the influence of RM and Suga's background as underground rappers;[305] during early visits to the US, the group received mentoring from American rappers. Bang Si-hyuk previously acknowledged that K-pop as a whole draws from black music, and author Crystal S. Anderson stated, \"BTS's rising popularity in the US represents the continuation of the ways that K-pop functions as part of a global R&B tradition.\" T.K. Park and Youngdae Kim of Vulture deemed the track \"Outro: Her\" from Love Yourself: Her as the best example of the group's understanding of old-school hip hop, with raps inspired by Chuck D and Tupac and jazzy chords from the 1990s to create a classic hip hop sound.[309]\n\nThe release of \"Blood Sweat & Tears\" in 2016 accelerated BTS's transition from a hip hop to a pop group. Park and Kim noted that the song draws from dancehall, reggaeton, and moombahton but opts for a \"baroque mysticism\" rather than the \"partylike atmosphere of its influences\".[309] The group also began incorporating traditional Korean elements into their music. For example, their single \"Idol\" (2018) features an adlib from Pansori, a Korean form of operatic storytelling, and vocal imitations of the sounds of Korean janggu drums.[312]\n\nWhile BTS maintains roots in hip hop, their sound has diversified. They first experimented with R&B, rock and jazz hip hop on Dark & Wild in 2014;[313] EDM in their The Most Beautiful Moment in Life album series; moombahton and tropical house on Wings and You Never Walk Alone ;[315][316] future bass and Latin pop in their Love Yourself album series; slow-dance ballads,[317] emo rap, Afro pop,[318] funk, trap, pop rock, and hip pop in their Map of the Soul album series;[319] and disco in their single \"Dynamite\".[320][321] The band members have explored different genres on solo tracks, such as neo soul on V's \"Stigma\" and flowing R&B on Jimin's \"Lie\".[315]\n\nLyrical themes\n\nSince their formation, BTS have believed that telling their own stories is the best way for the younger generation to relate to their music.[322] Writing many of their own lyrics,[323][324] the group discusses universal life experiences such as sadness and loneliness in their work and turn them into something lighter and more manageable. RM stated that BTS tries to avoid a preaching or reprimanding tone in their songs \"because that's not the way that we want to spread our message ... We're born with different lives, but you cannot choose some things. So we thought that love, the real meaning of it, starts with loving ourselves and accepting some ironies and some destinies that we have from the very start.\"[325] When asked if it is difficult to write about things like mental health, Suga responded,\n\nWe feel that people who have the platform to talk about those things really should talk more, because they say depression is something where you go to the hospital and you're diagnosed, but you can't really know until the doctor talks to you ... More and more, I think artists or celebrities who have a voice should talk about these problems and bring it up to the surface.[325]\n\nThemes explored in BTS's discography range from exploring \"the troubles and anxieties of school-age youth\" to \"themes like love, friendship, loss, death, and more.\"[326] Early BTS songs, such as \"No More Dream\" and \"N.O\" from their school trilogy, were described by Tamar Herman as motivated by personal experiences with South Korea's rigid approach to education and called for change to the educational system and societal expectations.[327] The members' experiences with South Korean youth culture also inspired the songs \"Dope\" and \"Silver Spoon\" (Korean: \ubc41\uc0c8; RR : Baepsae) from their youth trilogy. These songs reference generational disparity and millennials giving up romantic relationships, marriage, children, proper employment, homes, and social life in the face of economic difficulties and societal ills while facing condemnation from the media and older generations.[327] The group's label dubbed The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever, the conclusion to their youth trilogy, \"a special album that marks the conclusion of the epic journey of the series, containing the last stories told by young people who, despite an uncertain and insecure reality (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt. 1) continue to surge forward (The Most Beautiful Moment in Life Pt. 2).\" Wings focused on mental health, criticisms of the K-pop \"idol\" scene, and delivering a female empowerment message.[329] The Love Yourself series introduced new themes regarding youth culture in South Korea, including the excitement of love, pain of farewell, and enlightenment of self-love. According to Kathy Sprinkel, BTS's 2020 \"quarantine album\" Be \"chronicles the group's coming to terms with a suddenly new reality and offers support for their listeners going through the same upheaval and uncertainty\".\n\nBTS's lyrics have also addressed topics outside youth culture. The song \"Am I Wrong\" from Wings questioned societal apathy towards changing the status quo; the lyric \"We're all dogs and pigs / we become dogs because we're angry\" appeared to reference South Korean Ministry of Education official Na Hyang-wook, who advocated a caste system for the country and who reportedly described average people as \"dogs and pigs\". BTS released the song amid the 2016 South Korean political scandal that resulted in the impeachment of president Park Geun-hye.[327] RM and Suga's personal struggles with mental health have inspired some of their music.[325][309] \"Not Today\" from 2017's You Never Walk Alone is an anti-establishment anthem, urging \"all the underdogs in the world\" to keep fighting,[332] and \"Spring Day\" honored the victims of the Sewol Ferry tragedy.[333] Journalist Jeff Benjamin praised BTS in Fuse for \"speak[ing] honestly about topics they deem important, even in a conservative society\".[334] Former South Korean president Moon Jae-in said: \"Each of the seven members sings in a way that is true to himself and the life he wants to live. Their melody and lyrics transcend regional borders, language, culture, and institutions.\"[335]\n\nImpact\n\nFor broader coverage of this topic, see Korean Wave\n\nBTS performing at the Korea-France Friendship Concert in Paris on October 14, 2018\n\nOn April 29, 2019, Time magazine named BTS one of the 100 most influential people of the year, labeling them the \"Princes of Pop\".[336] Billboard executive Silvio Pietroluongo compared the group's influence to that of the Beatles.[337] MRC Data executive Helena Kosinski noted that \"although BTS weren't the first to open the doors to K-Pop worldwide, they were the first to become mainstream. They don't just appeal to young people but also to the 50s and 60s age demographic.\"[338] The first non-English speaking artist to make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS was the second best-selling artists worldwide across multiple media platforms, second only to Drake.[339][340][341] In 2020, BTS became the first non-western and non-English speaking artist to be named IFPI's Global Recording Artist of the Year.[240] In South Korea, BTS accounted for 41.9 percent of album sales in the first half of 2019, up from their market share of 25.3 percent the previous year.[342]\n\nIn 2022, Youna Kim described BTS as having spearheaded the Korean Wave, representing the global expansion of Korean culture as effectively as Psy did in the previous decade and with the strength of influence that the Academy Award-winning South Korean film Parasite had in 2020. South Korea's central bank, the Bank of Korea, found in 2021 that BTS, including a \"ripple effect\" that included increased tourism to South Korea; increased interest in Korean culture, movies, and study of the Korean language; and added approximately US$5 billion per year to South Korea's economy, a growth of about 0.5 percent.[344] A 2018 study showed that, on average, 800,000 foreigners per year had visited South Korea over the past four years for BTS-related reasons.\n\nWriters identified BTS as leaders even among other highly influential K-pop groups such as Girls' Generation, Super Junior, Exo, Twice, and Blackpink and note that BTS's success shows the importance of a strong, active fan base in the age of social media, where fan campaigning can be as important as musical quality to a song's success. The group has also distinguished themselves at the forefront of the business side of the K-pop industry by pursuing less restrictive contracts with their management company to maximize their artistic originality and creativity.[348] With this newer approach to career management, BTS created closer ties to the South Korean youth and encourage individuality and authenticity among their audience.\n\nDiplomacy\n\nIn his 1990 essay Soft Power, political scientist Joseph Nye developed the concept of a second type of power different from traditional authoritarianism.[350] Nye wrote, \"This second aspect of power \u2013 which occurs when one country gets other countries to want what it wants \u2013 might be called co-optive or soft power in contrast with the hard or command power of ordering others to do what it wants.\"[351]. Researchers such as Maud Quessard have applied the concept of soft power to BTS and their influence on entertainment diplomacy and international relations. Youna Kim and Maud Quessard all read the currency of soft power as including culture, political values, and foreign policy, which applies to BTS's ability to be co-optive in their approach to spreading their message of harmony, acceptance, and addressing life's setbacks via their broad appeal on the international stage.\n\nBTS was invited to address the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September 2018.[353][354] That same year they performed in Paris before an audience of 400, including President Moon Jae-in and other officials, at the 2018 Korea-France Friendship Concert, a summit celebrating the friendly relations between France and South Korea.[355] That year, BTS became the youngest recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit. Despite cultural medals traditionally being given to recipients with over 15 years of achievement, Moon recognized the group, five years into their career, for their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language worldwide.[356][357] In September 2019, BTS were mentioned by Moon while announcing strategies for the content industries, for having pioneered innovative business models through direct communication with fans.[358] In 2020, BTS received the James A. Van Fleet Award in recognition of their outstanding contributions to the promotion of US-Korea relations, the youngest honorees to receive the award.[359][360] In July 2021, they were appointed Special Presidential Envoy for Future Generations and Culture by President Moon. In their role as envoys, they help to \"raise awareness on global agendas, such as sustainable development, to our future generations and to strengthen the nation's diplomatic power across the world\"[361] and appear at international events such as the 76th United Nations General Assembly.[362] On May 31, 2022, BTS visited US President Joe Biden at the White House to discuss the recent rise in anti-Asian hate crimes and discrimination.[363]\n\nFandom\n\nAccording to Kyung Hyun Kim, BTS's rise was facilitated by a great increase in music video programming and consumption on YouTube and the coming of an idol empire, including merchandising of nonmusical products, games, and fantasy fiction, as well as an expansion of online music fandom. The group has a large, highly organized, online community of fans known as ARMY (Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth), which translates the group's lyrics and social media posts into other languages and matches charitable contributions of BTS's members. As of 2020, some 40 million ARMY members subscribe to the band's YouTube channel, with more than 30 million following the official BTS Twitter and Instagram accounts.[83] The fan community helps generate BTS's number-one chart rankings via coordinated campaigns on streaming platforms, as well as pushes to feature BTS's music on radio stations and television. Some ARMY members may even surpass the group itself in influence among BTS fans.\n\nFans at the BTS world tour concert 'Love Yourself' in Los Angeles on September 6, 2018.\n\nBTS interacted and engaged with their followers from their earliest days via social media, as well as via BTS Universe, an alternate storyline involving the members told through music videos, mobile games, books, short films, and more that gives fans room to theorize.[369] Kim suggested that ARMY are drawn to BTS since the members are seen as underdogs, originating from the Korean countryside and a relatively minor Korean entertainment company, which allows young fans to identify with them. BTS's lyrics speak to social values, and fans respond by trying to improve the world. As a result, the fandom regularly embraces activism on charitable causes and socio-political issues such as refugee crises, racial discrimination, children's rights, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic.[371][372] Feedback from ARMY to BTS affects the group's actions and lyrics; BTS has eliminated certain Korean words that sound like American racial slurs from their songs and ended collaboration with a Japanese producer when Korean ARMY members deemed his views extreme.\n\nPer South Korean author Jiyoung Lee, the relationship between BTS and ARMY is \"a mutual exchange between artists and their fans\" that is about more than merely \"ensuring the band's primacy\", but also \"extending the band's message of positivity into the world\". Lee opines that BTS and ARMY are \"a symbol of change in zeitgeist, not just of generational change\". The band members themselves agree and have long acknowledged their fans' role in their success. According to Sarah Keith, \"BTS embody a moment of generational transformation. ARMY represents a 'coming of age' for the young, in which cultural production and influence are global and meaningful, and where the youth are politically and socially engaged.\"\n\nEndorsements\n\nBTS partnered with Puma beginning in 2015, initially as Puma Korea's brand ambassadors before expanding to global ambassadors in 2018, and promoting the remix of Puma's \"Turin\" and \"Sportstyle\" line worldwide.[378][379][380] In 2019, BTS signed with Fila to endorse its sportswear.[381] BTS has also served as global brand ambassadors for LG Electronics' smartphones,[382] and Hyundai Motors' 2019 flagship SUV the \"Palisade\"[383] and hydrogen fuel cell electric SUV, the \"Nexo\".[384] BTS became global ambassadors of the electric street racing series Formula E to promote how electric vehicles can help combat climate change.[385] In 2020, BTS partnered with Samsung Electronics,[386] releasing a limited BTS-themed version of the Galaxy S20+ and Galaxy Buds+.[387] As the first male pop group ever to collaborate with Dior, BTS sported ensembles from Kim Jones' Pre-Fall 2019 collection at their concert at Stade de France.[388] The band became global brand ambassadors for Louis Vuitton in April 2021.[389]\n\nMembers\n\nJin ( \uc9c4 ) \u2013 vocalist [390]\n\n) \u2013 vocalist Suga ( \uc288\uac00 ) \u2013 rapper [391]\n\n) \u2013 rapper
