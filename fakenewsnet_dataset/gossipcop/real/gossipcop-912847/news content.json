The photo showcases the injuries on the officer\u2019s head.\n\nCircuit Court for Palm Beach County\n\nShe had been discovered trespassing in a hotel room with an unidentified man, according to a police report. The pair had entered the wrong room at the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach and refused to leave.\n\nPolice say Lesseps, 52, slammed a door and kicked at least one officer. \u201cOfficer O\u2019Leary then attempted to detain De Lesseps and remove her from the bathroom, at which time De Lesseps shoved Officer O\u2019Leary with an open palm to the chest, then slammed the door on Officer O\u2019Leary face, striking him in the forehead. While De Lesseps was being placed in handcuffs she resisted by pushing and pulling away from Officer O\u2019Leary and I,\u201d the police report states.\n\nShe was charged with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer/firefighter/EMT, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office. She pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nWATCH: Bethenny Frankel Talks \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 and Luann De Lesseps Returning After Arrest\n\nAfter her arrest, de Lesseps \u2014 who had gotten married to ex-husband Tom D\u2019Agostino in Palm Beach on last New Year\u2019s Eve before their divorce seven months later \u2014 released a statement saying, \u201cThis was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding, and being here brought up long-buried emotions. I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I might have offended with my behavior. I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018.\u201d\n\nLater that week, de Lesseps told PEOPLE in another statement, \u201cI have decided to seek professional guidance and will be voluntarily checking into an alcohol treatment center. I intend to turn this unfortunate incident into a positive life changing event. Once again, I sincerely apologize for my actions.\u201d\n\nAfter checking herself into an alcohol treatment facility, she returned to the Big Apple and reunited with her RHONY castmates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be home. I\u2019m doing great. Spending time with friends and family,\u201d she tweeted Jan. 23. \u201cThanking everyone for your continued good wishes and support.\u201d", "images":
