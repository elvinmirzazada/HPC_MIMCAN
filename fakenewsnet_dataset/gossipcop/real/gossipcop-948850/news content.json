News yesterday afternoon at a KKW Beauty fan event, the 37-year-old - who is already a mother to children North, Saint and Chicago - opened up about asking for help and guidance from first-time mother Kylie.\n\n\u2018Lately, it's been Kylie,\u2019 she said when questioned who she goes to for advice on being a new mum. \u2018Kylie is up on all the new gadgets and the new baby stuff.\u2019\n\nHowever, the make-up mogul was quick to praise sister Khlo\u00e9, who also became a new mum to baby True Thompson in May.\n\n\u2018But Khloe and I probably have the most similar parenting style and I will usually go to one of my best friends Larsa Pippen because she has four kids for mom advice,\u2019 she added.\n\nThe reality star also revealed the Kardashian/Jenner women have formed a tighter bond since welcoming so many new babies into the family in recent years.\n\n\u2018I think we're even closer now because Kourtney and I, even if we don't disagree on some parenting tips, we'll discuss them thoroughly and we respect each other's rules, but we pick up the slack for each other too,\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018I know that if Kourtney's out of town, then the kids will sleep at my house and we'll plan these fun things where the kids always feel loved. We're always helping each other out.\u2019\n\nFollowing the return of Khlo\u00e9 to Los Angeles last month, following a few months after news of her beau Tristan Thompson\u2019s alleged affair hit headlines, Kim revealed the family is far more at peace now the 34-year-old star is back at home.\n\n\u2018I definitely feel like we are more connected now especially that Khlo\u00e9's back and we're hanging out with all the babies,\u2019 she gushed. \u2018All the kids want to hang out. It's just a whole different experience now. It's so much fun.\u2019\n\nWe can only imagine the fun the family are having right now!", "images":
