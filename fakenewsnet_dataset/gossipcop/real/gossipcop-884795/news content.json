And I just, I\u2019ve got a lot of emotions. I don\u2019t even know what to say. I mean, it\u2019s sad. It\u2019s sad for me, but I\u2019m putting myself to work, keeping myself busy, and trying to move past it and move on to the next chapter of my life.\u201d\n\nAs for D\u2019Agostino, \u201cWe\u2019re not hanging out, but we\u2019re on friendly terms, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d she said, adding that they intended to settle things swiftly: \u201cWe wanted it to be amicable, and that\u2019s how we live our lives. \u201d\n\nThe businessman\u2019s attorney, Daniel Lipschutz, confirms the case was amicably settled and that uncontested divorce papers were submitted Sept. 18 after D\u2019Agostino filed for divorce in early August. Asked if there was a prenuptial agreement, he had no comment.\n\nNow, De Lesseps is focusing on healing Florida with the Red Cross.\n\n\u201cI deeply pray for a better tomorrow,\u201d she wrote on Instagram Tuesday. \u201cToday is a very sad day. I am going to do whatever I can in whatever capacity to help. Heading to the Florida Keys to help with the Red Cross because they are still in need #florida #puertorico #texas #lasvegas spread love not hate #comfort #love #worldincrisis #help.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease help in any capacity that you can,\u201d she urged. \u201cWhether you donate your time or money, it doesn\u2019t matter what matters is that every little bit helps. I registered with the @americanredcross when hurricane Harvey hit Texas back in August but it takes some time to go through the application process. So start the application now with any charity of your liking. We can all chip in to help humanity! The world needs love and we can provide it.\u201d\n\nDe Lesseps wed D\u2019Agostino on Dec. 31, 2016, in a lavish, three-day celebration in Palm Beach, Florida, attended by several friends of the bride from the Housewives franchise.\n\nThe Bravo star, 52, was married to Count Alexandre de Lesseps for 16 years. D\u2019Agostino, 50, had not previously been married.\n\nBeset by doubts about their relationship throughout their whirlwind courtship, the pair weathered split rumors in mid-July, with a source telling PEOPLE the couple had hit a \u201cmajor rough patch.\u201d\n\n\u201cTom and I are in love, and marriage takes work,\u201d she told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cWe are working on this together.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 3, de Lesseps officially announced their divorce via Twitter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!\u201d\n\nDe Lesseps later told PEOPLE that \u201cthis has been one of the toughest times of my life.\u201d\n\nStill, she\u2019s been working on \u201creconnecting\u201d with herself, \u201cfocusing on my family and my business.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to pour my heart into music again,\u201d she revealed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been working on a book about resilience, about how I bounce back no matter what life throws at me. I don\u2019t regret this marriage. I have learned from it.\u201d", "images":
