The filter, in addition to imposing a flower tucked behind True\u2019s right ear, also alters face shape, eye color, lashes and skin tone, creating the effect of a smattering of freckles perfectly distributed across the cheeks and nose.\n\nWhile the post was flooded with likes and sweet comments from fans, the filter also created confusion as many began to debate and speculate upon which features were really True\u2019s.\n\n\u201cDoes the baby have freckles or is that the filter?\u201d asked user @coldheartedqueen4life.\n\n\u201cWhat is with the silly filter?\u201d asked user @luca9557.\n\n\u201cDoes the baby really need a filter?\u201d said user @2blackheart. \u201cThis picture is so deceiving.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop with the filters,\u201d commented user @kdotl22. \u201cWe can\u2019t even tell her true color.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove her! Adorable! Congrats @khloekardashian,\u201d wrote user @autumn.leafe. \u201cBut too funny to introduce a baby into the word with a filter on them. But that\u2019s the Kardashian way, to cover up\u2026 But seriously, she is precious and perfect.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

In March, sister Kylie Jenner, 20, debuted her daughter Stormi\u2018s face using a popular filter that imposes a crown of crackling flames.\n\nKylie Jenner/Instagram\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Shares Sweet Video of \u2018Cutie\u2019 Chicago\n\nA source tells PEOPLE that the fact that all three moms recently chose to use a filter on their little one isn\u2019t a coincidence. The source says it\u2019s a conscious decision made for privacy purposes \u2014 the stars feel that they are protecting their babies if they don\u2019t show their full face. (That being said, both Kim and Kylie have since gone on to share non-filtered photos and videos of their respective daughters.)\n\nDuring the 10th anniversary special of their show last year, the family opened up about allowing their significant others and kids to appear on camera, with Kourtney Kardashian, 39, noting that \u201cthe boundaries are always changing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely go through moments where we\u2019re like, \u2018Cut the kids way back,\u2019 \u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny now that Mason is getting older,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9 of Kourtney and Scott Disick\u2018s 8-year-old son. \u201cHe knows. He doesn\u2019t watch it, but I\u2019ve heard him talk to his friends and say, \u2018I\u2019m on a TV show called Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\u2019 I\u2019m like, how does he know that?!\u201d\n\n\u201cMason calls [the crew] the filmers,\u201d said Kourtney. \u201cHe used to be like, \u2018Are the filmers coming? I want to show them my Legos that I\u2019m building.\u2019 Now he\u2019s in a phase where he\u2019s like, \u2018I don\u2019t like when the filmers are over.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor her part, Kim said appearing on KUWTK is \u201csuch a personal choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can fall in love with someone, and it\u2019s not their job to be on our show,\u201d she said. \u201cKanye [West] respects what I do and sometimes he\u2019s on, if he happens to be there, or will let us film if we\u2019re at a concert. At first we were like, \u2018Our kids will never be on, my daughter is not going to be on.\u2019 But she\u2019s always around me and she\u2019s so cute, so I just want people to see [that] a little bit. It\u2019s never a story revolving [around] them or about them or anything too personal. We know that we signed up for this, but our kids did not.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/5WOL_WSeq0Q9rRABCgE4dRj960A=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x9:751x11)/mason-disick-bar-mitz-121922-2-6df29e4d4a054190875577dcc72fd627.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/AljMkTe9oZwMxosK1hIYza8ENIs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(508x0:510x2)/stormi-2-2000-16b08f5a3fb745078d27a3440b18e7a3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/AzZjTZvx1QuH9iLGvfEMpyo3XOQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/stormi-d4aa680510d84f24a76768b9864698d1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1ypHa35C9KyQa83aFLwxn5Nr0Is=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x469:721x471)/The-Kardashians-Season-3-02-042723-b7c096e235974e1c87aa4278a8c27243.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HqUlGCQlW_s-LHPsZRruBTyc8To=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kardashians-holiday-style-20191125_96-2000e5b945954a8f8b38278d554a4659.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4fuPVUgcW2ytGz-5nMZ17Ln9yNI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x278:1001x280)/kim-kardashian-121922-2000-bed3f15b4abc4e9fb48514bfdf6b58fa.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/h_iHg2mg0Pg1X88uaZsYFuHWoOI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x259:736x261)/kim-kardashian-kids-pajamas-121522-712c29756e62458484f20fa3fee5c415.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZfqG0qxriEpCOMTVSWQ_Qk3oSIA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(809x399:811x401)/Vanity-Fair-Kardashians-test-01-121522-b7e434d2f3244c7c8057c6053bbd3541.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/OTewwrKRs1zHc5gBFdxfep8umJo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(572x0:574x2)/khloe-kardashian-chicago-make-up-092722-4-c254bc607b144aa3ad04ed210dd797f6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1QEZF2MwmyR4FHIJ2OnkpdvZeFM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kim-kardashian-elf-on-the-shelf-120122-8-tout-66d583cfdbac42f1a8e370138718d3e5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/AbA_dsEa3n3_zSUb4Bkq6veTGMw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(539x159:541x161)/true-thompson-kim-kylie-kardashian-tshirts-052523-3-1de3a4805332430287da740a93e921f8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/U1YgJ-AU69EURpjC_IFtxHLjkvM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1030x578:1032x580)/scott-disick-052923-0f18fb04bc024af9b3197b6cce45b34f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/Go2KQxU1zSREw5hxQkwmgMgSEBY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kim-kardashian-chicago-west-dream-021623-1-4b98acba83094316982244aac386ab89.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZzchOL-YIsPM_mqkBMxf632GkcM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x398:921x400)/Kim-Kardashian-kids-021123-04-bef986492d9846ba82ad499f4a72ecc2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/BL1wTmmzf4ndMiETNAUF3K8bS_c=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/nup_186549_0001-1-2000-b3e910bb6d3f4f8c97fa60b743abe79c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/wqQyYgacr3b84uTrzE0bBrKfqWY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x670:941x672)/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-kids-1-304f53bd13b740a4a474fe7adc98be8f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hSYp4PUBjKwN8I33ZG48TkHTIe4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Kris-Jenner-Mason-Reign-birthdays20191125_88-16420ac20cdc4491baa127a0cd2167be.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HVFfH25NJm2S5sHMRQKTpG7aKe4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x599:961x601)/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-tout-efe2a8aec78943228831d11be4e9ae25.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/AzZjTZvx1QuH9iLGvfEMpyo3XOQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/stormi-d4aa680510d84f24a76768b9864698d1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aili Nahas", "Aili Nahas Is The Former West Coast Deputy News Director At People.
