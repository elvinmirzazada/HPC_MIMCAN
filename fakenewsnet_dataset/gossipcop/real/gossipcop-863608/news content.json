News on Tuesday at the New York premiere of Blind. \u201cWe\u2019re getting remarried on Friday.\u201d\n\nHilaria chimed in: \u201cNow there\u2019s gonna be people at our doorstep!\u201d\n\nNaturally, Alec worked to cover up his snafu. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have said that \u2026 Did I say remarried? We\u2019re remodeling. Remodeling the house on Friday,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the secret out, Hilaria went on to give details about the sweet event.\n\n\u201cBasically we wanted to have a party and we wanted our friends to come,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do something for like five minutes, I think, and then the rest of the time we\u2019re gonna be eating.\u201d\n\nIn short, Alec added, it\u2019s an \u201cexcuse to have cake and wine.\u201d\n\n\u2018Speaking of Pigs\u2019: Ireland Baldwin Goes There in Speech Honoring Dad Alec Baldwin\n\nThe lovebirds married in 2012, just three months after announcing their engagement. They began dating in 2011 with Alec saying later that Hilaria is \u201cvery important\u201d to him. The couple has four children: Leonardo, 9 months, Rafael, 2, Carmen, 3, and 21-year-old Ireland (Alec\u2019s daughter from his marriage to Kim Basinger).\n\nAlthough the Baldwins are looking forward to their cake and wine, Hilaria opened up about the importance of the upcoming ceremony.\n\n\u201cYou think, like, once you get married, everything\u2019s like, you\u2019re done,\u201d she told the Associated Press. \u201cBut it\u2019s really good to say, \u2018hey I\u2019m still in this.\u2019 \u201c", "images":
