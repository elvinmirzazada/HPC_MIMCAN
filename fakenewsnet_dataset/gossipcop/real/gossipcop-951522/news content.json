If commitment-phobes like Justin Bieber and Jax Taylor can magically become loyal (LOL), why can\u2019t the rest of Hollywood, which is basically the Land of Misfit F*ckboys? Which celebs are getting engaged next? We\u2019re here to tell you! Here are our v serious predictions.\n\nKris Jenner and Corey Gamble\n\nDude, Kris Jenner has really been through it in terms of marriage. Her first husband defended OJ and her second husband aired her out in a tell-all book. Since Kris is Regina George\u2019s mom come to life, of course she dates a guy that one of her daughters probably rejected at 1OAK. Is the age difference a little inappropriate? Yes. But Kris Jenner capitalized off of her daughter\u2019s leaked sex tape, let her 16-year-old kid get lip injections, and possibly has an illegitimate daughter with OJ Simpson, so I don\u2019t think \u201cage-appropriate\u201d is really in her vocabulary. And besides, Kris Jenner is Big D*ck Energy. She DGAF about what\u2019s appropriate and what isn\u2019t. She deserves holy matrimony with Corey. There, I said it. This is the only couple on this list I really want marriage for.\n\nBella Thorne and Mod Son\n\nMuch like showering, I really didn\u2019t think holy matrimony was in the cards for Bella Thorne and Mod Son. But now that there\u2019s an influx of dumb engagements, maybe I\u2019m wrong (probably not about the shower thing, though). Bella Thorne is what happens when you don\u2019t stop drinking double vodka Red Bulls and listening to TECH N9NE past the age of 19. And Mod Son is what happens when that rapper Sweet Dee dated on It\u2019s Always Sunny gets addicted to DMT. So given their shared love of terrible hygiene and giving us the heebie-jeebies on social media, their love may be as long-lasting as their terrible tattoos. And should they get pregnant, it\u2019ll be interesting to see what they name their children since they named their dog TAMPON. Maybe they were so high they thought that naming their dog after a personal hygiene product would automatically make them hygienic. IDK, just my theory.\n\nSuki Waterhouse and Rob Pattinson\n\nThey announced they were dating last week, so it\u2019s high time these two get engaged already! I mean, Travis Scott and Kylie had a baby, and Travis doesn\u2019t even know the names of all Kylie\u2019s dogs. Why get to know the person before embarking on a wedding engagement when you can do that AFTER you agree to spend the rest of your lives together?\n\nDane Cook and His 18-Year-Old GF\n\nIf Katherine McPhee can get engaged to David Foster, who says Dane Cook won\u2019t continue the trend of marrying your much younger sugar baby? We always knew Dane Cook would be destined to marry a trashy hot girl with an intentionally misspelled name with an \u201ci\u201d at the end, but we\u2019re a little surprised that he could land one who\u2019s 18. Dane Cook is like that creepy third-tier frat bro who peaked at whatever commuter college he went to and is a fixture at Dave and Buster\u2019s happy hour. And Kelsi, his girlfriend, is like the naive hostess who gave in to his advances because he bought her a few black raspberry margaritas so she wouldn\u2019t get carded. How romantic. Based on the comments Dane leaves on her Instagram, he seems to be really smitten by her. How sweet! Maybe she\u2019s mature for her age and that\u2019s why they\u2026.k, nvm.\n\nCorinne Olympios and Jonathan Cheban\n\nCorinne and Jonathan have been trying to have us guessing if they\u2019ve been dating for months now. And literally, no one cared. So what\u2019s the best way to get everyone to give a sh*t? Get engaged. Corinne could totally get married in that famous white wedding bikini from her first Bachelor episode. You know, the challenge where she took her top off because she wasn\u2019t getting enough attention? And then they can bond over how much they hate me because I pissed Corinne off when I asked her about her Juicy J music video, and I pissed Jonathan Cheban off when I wrote that deep dive article about all the people he blocked on social media. Anyway, me making everything about myself aside, a wedding would be the only way for these two to finally (kind of) get our attention.\n\nImages: Giphy (3)", "images":
