You know I share everything. It\u2019s you guys! It\u2019s so hard.\u201d\n\nTeigen also joked that she understood why the situation went down and even had to double check with husband John Legend that it wasn\u2019t actually her.\n\n\u201cIf I had a dollar for every time that I had a few glasses of wine or something and would have done something like that? Oh man, very rich,\u201d Teigen joked. \u201cI asked John yesterday, I was like \u2018It\u2019s not me, is it?\u2019\u201d\n\nTeigen tweeted on Monday that she knows the unnamed actress who Haddish claims bit the \u201cLemonade\u201d singer in the face at an after-party for JAY-Z back in December.\n\n\u201cI cannot leave this planet without knowing who bit Beyonce in the face,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI can only think of one person who would do this. but I cannot say. but she\u2026.is the worst.\u201d\n\nHaddish, 38, who was at the event where the incident supposedly took place, revealed her version of the story in a recent interview with GQ.\n\n\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 stormed away\u2026went up to JAY-Z, and was like, \u2018Jay! Come here! This bitch\u2014\u2019 and snatched him. They went to the back of the room. I was like, \u2018What just happened?\u2019 And Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s friend walked up and was like, \u2018Can you believe this bitch just bit Beyonc\u00e9?\u2019\u201d Haddish said.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s representative, Yvette Noel-Schure, responded to the claim by telling GQ, \u201cI absolutely cannot comment on any of this, as I have no knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe comedienne wouldn\u2019t name Queen Bey\u2019s attacker but said that wasn\u2019t the end of their dealings that night. Haddish said the actress later told her to stop dancing, so the funny lady gave Beyonc\u00e9 a heads up that she wasn\u2019t afraid to scuffle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to beat somebody ass at your party. I just want to let you know that,\u201d Haddish claimed she told Beyonc\u00e9. However, the singer told her to forget about it and \u201chave fun,\u201d Haddish said, leading to their selfie to cool down tension.\n\nShe added, \u201cNear the end of the party, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s at the bar, so I said to Beyonc\u00e9, \u2018Did she really bite you?\u2019 She was like, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 I was like, \u2018She gonna get her ass beat tonight.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBeyonc\u00e9, 36, kept a cool head, according to Haddish. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Tiffany, no. Don\u2019t do that. That bitch is on drugs. She not even drunk. The bitch is on drugs. She not like that all the time. Just chill.\u2019\u201d", "images":
