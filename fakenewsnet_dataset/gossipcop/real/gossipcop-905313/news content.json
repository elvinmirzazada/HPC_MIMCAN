And as we near the end of the hour, it\u2019s unclear what will happen to the younger Pearson man \u2014 especially since they brothers have only 48 left to spend together.\n\nWe cut back to the present day, where Kevin (Justin Hartley) and his girlfriend Zoe (Melanie Liburd) have been diving into his father and (supposedly late) uncle\u2019s past in the small village in Vietnam where Jack was stationed.\n\nThere is a loud explosion and Jack goes running to find Nicky, with one of the soldiers noting that, \u201cA boat exploded. I think one of our guys was on it.\u201d Jack dives into the water and begins to swim toward a scene we can\u2019t see.\n\nWe come back to Kevin in the present, where the translator who was helping him communicate with a local historian, mentions casually he was going to suggest something Kevin could bring home to lay on his uncle\u2019s war memorial one day \u2014 but then he found out his uncle isn\u2019t dead.\n\n\u201cNone of your family died in the war,\u201d he says, telling him he checked the war memorial database, Nicholas Pearsons\u2019 name isn\u2019t there. He didn\u2019t die in Vietnam \u2014 at least not in the war, anyway.\n\nThen we cut to the interior of a trailer, where a man \u2014 played by Griffin Dunne \u2014 is taking off his coat. The camera focuses on a piece of mail that is addressed to \u201cNicholas Pearson\u201d and sent to his residence in Bradford, Pennsylvania.\n\nYep, Nicky is alive and well \u2014 and when the show returns next year, he\u2019ll be played in the present day by Dunne.\n\nAnd, we bet, Kevin is probably going to come looking for him.\n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d will return Jan. 15 on NBC.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dwts-s32-semifinals.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lessons-in-Chemistry-Harriet-Aja.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/the-masked-singer-cow.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Nicky-This-Is-Us.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Thomas-Augsberger.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Nicky-This-Is-Us.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Nicky-This-Is-Us.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas", "Ross A.
