(Disick, 34, also shares son Mason, 7, with ex Kourtney Kardashian, though their eldest son doesn\u2019t appear in the video.)\n\nIn the clip, the father of three carries Penelope around until Reign asks to be picked up.\n\n\u201cThank you, Dad,\u201d Reign gushes as he settles into Disick\u2019s arms.\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d says Disick as his youngest son showers him with sweet kisses. \u201cYou\u2019re a funny little guy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is why I\u2019m thankful today,\u201d Disick captioned the post. \u201cHappy thanksgiving 2 all!!\u201d\n\nThis is why I'm thankful today.

A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Nov 23, 2017 at 12:38pm PST\n\nKardashian spent the holiday in Los Angeles, where her sister Kylie Jenner hosted an epic Thanksgiving feast for the family. It is not clear whether Disick was in attendance.\n\nThe former couple were together for nine years before she officially ended things in 2015. On the current season of the family\u2019s reality show, Disick \u2014 who has struggled with alcohol abuse \u2014 has been open about the fact that moving on from the relationship hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough. I mean, I don\u2019t live the cleanest-looking life,\u201d he said on a recent episode. \u201cI\u2019m a guy. I\u2019m a little younger. Maybe the way I\u2019m getting over her is a drop different, and it\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t really know what to do. If I step out of line one way, I could lose everybody in the matter of a second.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, we have three kids together, that\u2019s not going to change,\u201d he continued. \u201cMy biggest focus is learning how to really, legitimately move on and do a lot more with my kids without Kourtney.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more false hope [of us reconciling],\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just another transition in another weird part of being together and not being together.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171125145502im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171125145502im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/article-covers/3313_106804645_2016_05_02_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171125145502im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171125145502im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/scott-disick2.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171125145502im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/scott-disick2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171125145502im_/http://people.com/img/sign-up-bg.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171125145502im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/scott-disick2.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171125145502/http://people.com/tv/scott-disick-shares-video-kids-thanksgiving/", "title": "Scott Disick Is 'Thankful' for His Kids with Ex Kourtney Kardashian \u2014 See the Adorable Video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "scott disick, scott disick kids, scott disick family, mason disick, penelope disick, reign disick, kourtney kardashian, scott and kourtney, kourtney and scott", "news_keywords": "scott disick, scott disick kids, scott disick family, mason disick, penelope disick, reign disick, kourtney kardashian, scott and kourtney, kourtney and scott", "description": "Scott Disick shared a heartwarming clip of himself spending time with his son Reign, 2, and daughter Penelope, 5", "og": {"title": "Scott Disick Is 'Thankful' for His Kids with Ex Kourtney Kardashian \u2014 See the Adorable Video", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171125145502/http://people.com/tv/scott-disick-shares-video-kids-thanksgiving/", "description": "Scott Disick shared a heartwarming clip of himself spending time with his son Reign, 2, and daughter Penelope, 5", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171125145502im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/scott-disick2.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://people.com/tv/scott-disick-shares-video-kids-thanksgiving/", "description": "Scott Disick shared a heartwarming clip of himself spending time with his son Reign, 2, and daughter Penelope, 5", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/scott-disick2.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171125145502im_/http://people.com/tv/scott-disick-shares-video-kids-thanksgiving/", "title": "Scott Disick Is 'Thankful' for His Kids with Ex Kourtney Kardashian \u2014 See the Adorable Video", "description": "Scott Disick shared a heartwarming clip of himself spending time with his son Reign, 2, and daughter Penelope, 5", "site": "@people", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171125145502im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/scott-disick2.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
