News, \u201cI think she\u2019s done, yeah.\u201d\n\nRecounting the tension between Zolciak-Biermann and her longtime rival NeNe Leakes while filming the most recent RHOA season reunion, Cohen added, \u201c[Kim] walked out of that reunion and I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve seen the last of that wig at these reunions.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThough a rep for Bravo previously had no comment to PEOPLE, casting decisions are typically made after a season\u2019s reunion wraps.\n\nMoses Robinson/Bravo\n\nKim Zolciak-Biermann, Andy Cohen and NeNe Leakes\n\nZolciak-Biermann was one of the original Atlanta Housewives when the show first premiered in October 2008, before deciding to leave RHOA halfway through season 5.\n\n\u201c[RHOA] can be very combative. A lot of negativity,\u201d she told PEOPLE in July, when looking back on her time on the show. \u201cI just was extremely frustrated \u2014 it just was really a trying season for me. I had had enough.\u201d\n\nBut after years of being away from RHOA, Zolciak-Biermann returned to the show for Shere\u00e9 Whitfield\u2019s housewarming party at the season 9 finale \u2014 where she quickly butted heads with Kenya Moore.\n\nAsked at the time if she would consider rejoining the show for its 10th season, Zolciak-Biermann told PEOPLE she would consider it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very motivated by money,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything has a price. I\u2019m just giving it to you straight. Given the right amount of money for anything? Yeah, count me in. I like to work. I have six children to support, so for sure!\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

The most explosive incident came when Zolciak-Biermann said Leakes was \u201csick and disgusting\u201d and lived in a \u201croach nest,\u201d which came to be known as #RoachGate.\n\nLeakes responded with her own slams, calling Zolciak-Biermann \u201cracist\u201d and claiming she and her daughter Brielle \u201cdon\u2019t like black people.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: RHOA\u2019s Kim Zolciak Says She Received Death Threats After NeNe Leakes Called Her \u2018Racist\u2019\n\nIn a preview for Sunday\u2019s RHOA season 10 reunion part 2, Zolciak-Biermann and Leakes face off about their troubles in a heated battle that appears to lead to Zolciak-Biermann walking off the reunion stage in anger.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta reunion part 2 airs Sunday (8 p.m. ET) on Bravo", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/nYmcOktpQrHyO63oU72w5TIHfas=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(377x120:379x122)/kim-zolciak-biermann-daughters-brielle-ariana-052223-6c2d034581df4f2db00e0417c26b6020.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/L9VYbZrY51tGPeVRQ0VX0M0k0kA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(824x279:826x281)/nene-leakes-revolt-summit-122822-59ed6b0167604c8cb57625ef7b7e24aa.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/QAq26qYYteyrQ1cgU1Tr1c5iyGs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Kim-Zolciak-Biermann-Is-Ready-to-Move-On-from-Ex-Kroy-0517123-d71e3d9dce974f82b5ce9267d270cda0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4Ra1uda_BXAAOk8zaeQUhVHattY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(745x275:747x277)/sheree-whitfield-kim-zolciak-061223-1-47d8be8b4a934da29b09eea2664ff4ad.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/R-rZ1SQANEwwXjXEUki9b80rM5E=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(729x295:731x297)/brielle-biermann-lip-fillers-061923-2aa-9657171118904b69bd9b5bc04665958a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/wtHV27hm8R1Kp4qw5tibD1pWbQA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/kim-zolciak2-3d44a68484ac405c845b154f8cdde3fc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/C5oV29tiug01XfN1HwGOzuATQSs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x339:736x341)/nene-leakes-a77f2ac5612d4e35b1cad41db0c97098.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7_hqy7AJEiIFU5BO-qegqXyaqiM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x39:766x41)/NeNe-Leakes-222bc5cc49f9492c9e8c2067ca1ff797.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/6TvqD1foHpnj4t5BxIblmnhRRLg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(994x425:996x427)/kim-zolciak-biermann-tout-052623-56c0b4d03dd94e0792ac5a720f094395.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/FuHz_atHxW7vFuovyX4SwSJH1-k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x465:1001x467)/kim-zolciak-biermann-kroy-kiermann-divorce-050823-2-353bb67bd0bd44b39b495ccae076e2a1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/19UziPtuDTRr8px7wAwqStxHQYY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/nene-leakes-1-005e3fe091c544a3bd011d371fd036f9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/LkOW9qC6W59DVvp3O5q7M5a5PwQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Kim-Zolciak-Biermann-nene-leakes-4690c54f7de14aa6b7444a71c9457e8e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8u8bk6RDOMVbu1-mPHulCeXiP3U=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(313x383:315x385)/Kroy-Biermann-instagram-04-061923-a0caaeb842984c4fb2db813623d1c15b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/JmOnHobDle-cq8gBLib6jL6k964=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/nene-leakes-1-3-0f871fd6eafe4ca89fec05d98e31ab91.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/o-YkvU3Q1zygfxTCxHx3bndpt8c=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/bravocon-d-04e3b793ad924331b7614b2254a3eb79.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1DAHaLkdPAqJ7H55tB-EHVl4EVM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/kim-zolciak-biermann-1-2000-1-f61f0642789e4c518503da9e99b66d6d.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/1DAHaLkdPAqJ7H55tB-EHVl4EVM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/kim-zolciak-biermann-1-2000-1-f61f0642789e4c518503da9e99b66d6d.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Staff Editor For Human Interest S Digital Vertical At People.
