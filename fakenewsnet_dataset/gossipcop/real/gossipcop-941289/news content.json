Kerby is a talented designer who is opening many doors for others. Issa is a fixture in media who is doing the same. I\u2019m inspired by both,\u201d he said, adding that the message he hopes Rae sent in her jumpsuit is \u201cthat being your true and authentic self is always going to be a win.\u201d He summarized her looks of the evening, including a bright-green suit and slinky red dress worn onstage, as \u201cunapologetically black.\u201d\n\nBlackness was a central topic at last night\u2019s awards, which honored British Vogue editor in chief Edward Enninful with the Media Award and modeling legend Naomi Campbell with the Fashion Icon Award. Enninful was presented the honor from none other than Oprah and used his acceptance speech as a clarion call for inclusion and diversity in fashion. \u201cIn a world that is increasingly divided, we must remember: We are more alike than we are different. British Vogue is about being inclusive. It\u2019s not just the color of your skin but the diversity of perspective. That\u2019s what drives us forward, not back.\u201d\n\nIn her opening monologue Rae quipped, \u201cI\u2019m about as fashionable as Kanye is black. Only when it\u2019s convenient,\u201d referencing West\u2019s deeply offensive and mis-held belief articulated in an interview with TMZ that slavery was a choice. Our only qualm with Rae\u2019s joke is that by our count, she\u2019s fashionable all the time.\n\nCFDA 2018: The Latest Celebrity Arrivals, Breaking News, Full List of Winners, and More\n\nSee All of the Celebrity Looks From the 2018 CFDA Awards Red Carpet:", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/655e3ea66628b52df910471b/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b16d22876361040779a9dba/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/00-story-issa-rae-cfda.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6565063109ad44759cdd3263/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6560c4fe58a3e28c83920b73/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/65492a977adcc7181c0b5348/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b16d23901bc90041b0821a1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/01-issa-rae-cfda.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b15f0147ff9486d44986614/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-967452808.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/account-avatar.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b15f0102c7d2a68236f0dc8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-967452364.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/654abc07aa83d795b9bcd44d/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b15d8c7fcda8975bec67ce1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-967402562.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6564b85fa971373d8d075cd5/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/654bb22af79cb0b98c76ddfd/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo-reverse.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo-header.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/654129e424e12c0b7cfeccc0/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b16d22cfcda8975bec67d69/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-issa-rae-cfda.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6564aeed6d32738be2f6a2d1/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/654d59fc9de2734db2c94616/master/h_120%2Cc_limit/00-DECEMBER-ISSUE.png"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b16d22cfcda8975bec67d69/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-issa-rae-cfda.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Steff Yotka"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/issa-rae-cfda-dress-pyer-moss", "title": "The Making of Issa Rae\u2019s Resplendent CFDA Dress", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "On the CFDA Awards red carpet last night, one look stood out above the rest.", "id": "5b16c533c90a3471fe45af4f", "keywords": "cfda awards 2019", "news_keywords": "cfda awards 2019", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b16c533c90a3471fe45af4f", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"On the CFDA Awards red carpet last night, one look stood out above the rest.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b16d2254d05a9069712ed99/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-issa-rae-cfda.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b16d2254d05a9069712ed99/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-issa-rae-cfda.jpg\"}", "og": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b16d22cfcda8975bec67d69/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-issa-rae-cfda.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "The Making of Issa Rae\u2019s Resplendent CFDA Dress", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/issa-rae-cfda-dress-pyer-moss"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-06-05T19:01:52.848Z", "modified_time": "2018-06-05T19:01:52.848Z", "author": "Steff Yotka"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b16d22cfcda8975bec67d69/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-issa-rae-cfda.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "The Making of Issa Rae\u2019s Resplendent CFDA Dress"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b16d22cfcda8975bec67d69/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/00-social-issa-rae-cfda.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528225312.848, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
