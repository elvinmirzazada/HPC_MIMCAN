The amount of pressure that he has to face now, he\u2019s on every magazine cover. He\u2019s all over the place, and people have their opinions of him and I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a world that I am happy without \u2026 I mean, being in the spotlight if you will, it\u2019s exciting. I\u2019m not going to lie. Walking past a magazine and seeing myself in a little tiny picture in the corner, it\u2019s interesting. But, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not something that I need to get fulfillment in my life.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Season 22: Meet Arie Luyendyk Jr.\u2019s Bachelorettes Who will get the final rose? Arie Luyendyk Jr.\u2019s season 22 of The Bachelor is quickly approaching and the contestants have officially been announced. The list features 29 women from all over the country \u2014 and it includes a personal stylist, a social media manager and a fitness coach. Scroll down to meet the Bachelorettes [\u2026]\n\nKraus was a fan-favorite to be The Bachelor after he was the runner-up on Rachel Lindsay\u2019s season of The Bachelorette last year. Fans were shocked when Luyendyk Jr. was announced as the lead instead of Kraus, and some viewers even started calling Luyendyk Jr. \u201cnot Peter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel kind of bad for him,\u201d the personal trainer said about the fan\u2019s nickname for Luyendyk Jr. \u201cHe got kind of pushed into a pressure situation last minute it sounds like and I mean he\u2019s already got kind of like cards stacked against him going into a situation like that. To then be added on to that, not even being called by his own name, that\u2019s got to be tough.\u201d\n\nDespite things not working out with The Bachelor, Kraus has managed to stay busy. He just launched an app called Hive with former NFL star Terrell \u201cT.O.\u201d Owens.\n\n\u201cHive is a social networking app,\u201d the Bachelor finalist told Us. \u201cThe idea behind it is you have friends here in this area that you\u2019ve probably never met, so it will put you in sync with people who have similar interests based on the categories you select or the groups you join. You all go onto one feed and anything that you follow as far as categories will show up on that feed.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV The road to success in Hollywood is a little different for every would-be actor, but these days, reality TV is becoming a major launching pad for some of the industry's biggest stars.
