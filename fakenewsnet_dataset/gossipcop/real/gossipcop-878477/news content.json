As dolls in the 1980s were generally sold in sets of black and white, for Christmas one year her father bought \u201ca black mom doll, a white dad doll, and a child in each color. My dad had taken the sets apart and customized my family.\u201d\n\nProblems began in the seventh grade, when she had to complete a mandatory census by checking one of four boxes: \u201cwhite, black, Hispanic, or Asian.\u201d The pale, freckled, curly-haired Markle felt that to choose either white or black would be a rejection of one of her parents. Her teacher told her to check \u201cCaucasian\u201d because she looked white, but she couldn\u2019t. She ended up leaving the boxes unchecked. \u201cI left my identity blank\u2014a question mark, an absolute incomplete\u2014much like how I felt,\u201d she once said.\n\nBecause she is light-skinned and has not made an issue of being bi-racial\u2014though she has embraced it\u2014she has auditioned for white as well as black and Latina roles. There was widespread disbelief among viewers in Season Two of Suits when her black father, a high-powered lawyer played by the charismatic actor Wendell Pierce (of Treme fame), first appeared on the show\u2014most people didn\u2019t think her character, or the actress playing her, was bi-racial.\n\nOne thing Markle noticed about how she was perceived was that \u201cat almost every photo shoot they would airbrush out\u201d her freckles. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved my freckles,\u201d she now says, so when she was photographed for V.F., she was \u201cthrilled to work with Peter [Lindbergh] because he rarely retouches and he believes in such little makeup. I gave him a big hug and said, \u2018I am so excited to work with you because I know we will finally be able to see my freckles!\u2019 \u201d\n\nMore important, what does Queen Elizabeth think of the prospect of a marriage between her grandson and the American divorc\u00e9e? When asked if she thought the Queen opposed the match, Sally Bedell Smith, who has written biographies of Queen Elizabeth, Princess Diana, and most recently Prince Charles, said, \u201cThe stakes are obviously lower in the case of Harry because he is now fifth in line to the throne [in descending order, the others are Prince Charles, Prince William, Prince George, and Princess Charlotte]. They have to be concerned\u2014William and Harry will always have a special place because, whatever you think of Diana, she has a magical aura that continues. The fact that Harry and William are half Diana . . . that will never go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Queen is remarkably open-minded and she\u2019s very tolerant,\u201d Smith observes. William was allowed to cohabit with Kate (Middleton), even though she\u2019s the daughter of \u201ca very middle-class family. The Queen just looked at who Kate was and that she was in love with her grandson, and that she knew how to conduct herself with dignity and discretion, and that was the most important thing. I would imagine that the Queen\u2019s view of this would be: if they\u2019re in love and they\u2019re well suited, then they should proceed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day I think it\u2019s really simple,\u201d Markle says. \u201cWe\u2019re two people who are really happy.\u201d\n\nBonnie Hammer expressed her concern about Markle\u2019s sudden, international fame. \u201cShe isn\u2019t somebody who was already a celebrity, who had paparazzi tracking her day and night in Hollywood or New York or Toronto. She\u2019s going through something that should be the most glorious and open time in her life, to be able to share, but because of circumstances, that\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nMarkle credits the rock-solid support from her close friends for helping to sustain her. The international tennis great Serena Williams (who recently graced the cover of V.F.) is one of those friends. The two met about seven years ago at the Super Bowl. \u201cHer personality just shines,\u201d Serena said about Markle, who asked her advice on how to handle some of the more extreme results of fame, such as paparazzi showing up at her house and chasing her. \u201cI told her, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be who you are, Meghan. You can\u2019t hide.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnother close friend is the Bahrain-born fashion designer Misha Nonoo. They met in Miami through a mutual friend and immediately bonded. \u201cHer greatest strength is her compassion for others,\u201d says Nonoo. \u201cMuch of the work she does is unseen by the public.\u201d\n\nAnother close friend is the actress Abigail Spencer, who has been a Suits cast member. When asked why she thinks Harry was drawn to Markle, Spencer says, \u201cShe\u2019s got warm elegance, though her style is hard to pin down. It\u2019s classy and timeless. When you\u2019re talking to her, you feel like you\u2019re the only person on the planet. And it\u2019s just wonderful to see her so in love.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5908b35e16779f27abc0a375/1:1/pass/t-meghan-markle-style.png", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a968264ef611786ce8c2e1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-meghan-markle-10-17-cover.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825f472d37f5e2f7265/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825e025da666cd492e9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96826600c2752b9cb62d3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss05.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6564f6a6bb312f1f6321c521/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655274024562f3d29015ecce/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825e025da666cd492e7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-10-17-cover.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5824deca364154776b0ba9d3/1:1/pass/t-kate-middleton-meghan-markle.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825106117712f34f887/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss03.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a968254a3663211bf43089/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss02.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a968264ef611786ce8c2e1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-meghan-markle-10-17-cover.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Sam Kashner", "Peter Lindbergh", "Jessica Diehl"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/meghan-markle-cover-story", "title": "Cover Story: Meghan Markle, Wild About Harry!", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Battered by the tabloids\u2014to the point where her boyfriend, Prince Harry, issued a statement defending her\u2014actress and activist Meghan Markle has largely ignored the media storm.
