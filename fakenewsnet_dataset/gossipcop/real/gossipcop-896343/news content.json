It\u2019s been 23 years since the NBC sitcom premiered \u2014 but the beloved series still has fans around the globe.\n\nOn Monday\u2019s episode of her talk show, Ellen DeGeneres sat down with K-Pop phenomenon BTS, a seven-member South Korean boy band who became global superstars after the release of their June 2013 single \u201cNo More Dream\u201d and recently made their U.S. TV performance debut at the 2017 American Music Awards.\n\nOn their daytime debut, member RM (formerly known as Rap Monster) revealed that he taught himself English by watching the iconic series, which ran from 1994-2004.\n\n\u201cMy English teacher was a sitcom \u2014 Friends,\u201d he said. \u201cI think back in the days when I was like 14, 15, it was like a syndrome for all the Korean parents to make their kids watch Friends. I thought I was kind of like, a victim at that time, but right now I\u2019m the lucky one. So thanks to my mother \u2014 she bought all the seasons [on] DVD!\u201d\n\nRM said he started watching the show with Korean subtitles before switching over to English subtitles \u2014 and eventually removed all subtitles completely.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Why Jennifer Aniston Will Be Back on TV 13 Years After Friends \u2014 and the Key Role Reese Witherspoon Will Play\n\nAfter learning the singers were fans of the show, DeGeneres surprised the group with a slew of Friends souvenirs before asking them via an interpreter if they\u2019ve ever hooked up with one of their fans, who call themselves the ARMY. (The band get their name from the acronym for the Korean term \u201cBangtan Sonyeondan,\u201d or \u201cbulletproof boy scouts\u201d in English.)\n\n\u201cWe are doing it right now,\u201d said RM, slyly making eyes at the audience.\n\nThe Ellen DeGeneres Show airs weekdays (check local listings).", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/article-covers/3313_106804645_2016_05_02_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848im_/http://timeinc.brightcove.com.edgesuite.net/rtmp_uds/416418724/201707/267/416418724_5524714300001_5524694942001-th.jpg?pubId=416418724&videoId=5524694942001", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848im_/http://people.com/img/sign-up-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/bts3.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/bts3.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848/http://people.com/tv/k-pop-boy-band-bts-learned-english-watching-friends/", "title": "BTS: K-Pop Boy Band Learned English by Watching Friends", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "BTS, BTS band, BTS boy band, BTS k-pop, k-pop, korean pop, bts interview, bts ellen degeneres, ellen degeneres bts", "news_keywords": "BTS, BTS band, BTS boy band, BTS k-pop, k-pop, korean pop, bts interview, bts ellen degeneres, ellen degeneres bts", "description": "It's been\u00a023 years\u00a0since\u00a0Friends\u00a0premiered \u2014 but the beloved series still has fans around the globe", "og": {"title": "K-Pop Boy Band Phenomenon BTS Learned English by Watching\u00a0Friends", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848/http://people.com/tv/k-pop-boy-band-bts-learned-english-watching-friends/", "description": "It's been\u00a023 years\u00a0since\u00a0Friends\u00a0premiered \u2014 but the beloved series still has fans around the globe", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/bts3.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://people.com/tv/k-pop-boy-band-bts-learned-english-watching-friends/", "description": "It's been\u00a023 years\u00a0since\u00a0Friends\u00a0premiered \u2014 but the beloved series still has fans around the globe", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/bts3.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848im_/http://people.com/tv/k-pop-boy-band-bts-learned-english-watching-friends/", "title": "WATCH:\u00a0K-Pop Boy Band Phenomenon BTS Learned English by Watching\u00a0Friends", "description": "It's been\u00a023 years\u00a0since\u00a0Friends\u00a0premiered \u2014 but the beloved series still has fans around the globe", "site": "@people", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/bts3.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}}, "movies": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171127184848if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/IOuFE?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
