Thank you to Bravo, World of Wonder and the crew who became family for all your hard work and dedication to making this show the success that it is today. From the bottom of my heart, I sincerely thank you all and hope you will continue to follow my journey as I begin a new chapter of my life.\"\n\nRelated\n\nMadison has been with MDLLA since the very first season, joining the series as one of the original agents, alongside Josh Flagg and Chad Rogers.
