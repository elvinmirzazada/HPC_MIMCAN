Here is everything you need to know before you see it next month.\n\nThe release date\n\nThe third instalment of the trilogy will be in cinemas on 9 February 2018, just in time for Valentine's Day.\n\nThe plot\n\nIt's all about tackling difficult situations (and people) and coming out stronger on the other side. After accepting Christian Grey's proposal in Fifty Shades Darker, we next watch Anastasia Steele adjust to married life, the wealthy lifestyle that comes with it, and her new husband's controlling nature. Parts of Christian's past soon haunt them, when women from his previous life threaten to jeopardise their happy ending.\n\nThe bridal and eveningwear specialist Monique Lhuillier, who crafted Anastasia's sultry gold number and feathered cape for the masquerade scene in Fifty Shades Darker, was asked to design her wedding dress for Freed by costume designer Shay Cunliffe.\n\nRex\n\nIt seemed the obvious choice, as the designer dressed Reese Witherspoon, Lauren Conrad, Savannah Guthrie, Carrie Underwood, Britney Spears and Pink for their wedding days too.\n\nThe cast\n\nDakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan reprise the roles of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey respectively, while Rita Ora will return as his sister Mia following her small role in Fifty Shades Of Grey.\n\nRelated Story Fifty Shades of Grey Interview: Dakota Johnson\n\nNew cast members include Teen Wolf's Tyler Hoechlin, as Anastasia's former classmate; Bella Heathcote, as one of Christian's former submissives; and Smallville's Eric Johnson as one of Ana's colleagues who tries to pursue her romantically - much to Christian's dismay.\n\nKim Basinger will play Elena Lincoln, also known as Mrs. Robinson, a prominent figure in Christian's past. Robinne Lee, from Seven Pounds, makes her debut as vice president to Christian Grey at Grey Enterprises. Fay Masterson also joins Fifty Shades Freed as Christian's longtime housekeeper and cook, Gail Jones.\n\nThe soundtrack\n\nThe soundtrack for the Fifty Shades trilogy makes the film what it is, with past films featuring artists like Beyonc\u00e9's extra-sexy version of 'Crazy in Love' (Grey) and the Taylor Swift/Zayn Malik duet 'I Don't Want To Live Forever' (Darker).\n\nRelated Story Fifty Shades of Grey interview: Jamie Dornan\n\nFor Freed, Mr. Grey himself, Jamie Dornan, has a song on the track list - a cover of Paul McCartney's 'Maybe I'm Amazed'. His vocal appearance isn't as unexpected as you initially might think; before he became an actor he was the lead singer of a folk band called Sons Of Jim.\n\nHere is the full track list:\n\n'Capital Letters' \u2013 Hailee Steinfeld x BloodPop 'For You (Fifty Shades Freed)' \u2013 Liam Payne & Rita Ora 'Sacrifice' \u2013 Black Atlass feat.
