{"url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/02/monica-lewinsky-in-the-age-of-metoo", "text": "I discussed this idea with psychologist Jack Saul, founding director of New York\u2019s International Trauma Studies Program and author of Collective Trauma, Collective Healing. \u201cCollective trauma,\u201d he told me, \u201cusually refers to the shared injuries to a population\u2019s social ecology due to a major catastrophe or chronic oppression, poverty, and disease. While the events of 1998 in the United States do not fit neatly into such a definition, they may have led to some of the features we often associate with collective traumas: social rupturing and a profound sense of distress, the challenging of long-held assumptions about the world and national identity, a constricted public narrative, and a process of scapegoating and dehumanization.\u201d\n\nUntil recently (thank you, Harvey Weinstein), historians hadn\u2019t really had the perspective to fully process and acknowledge that year of shame and spectacle. And as a culture, we still haven\u2019t properly examined it. Re-framed it. Integrated it. And transformed it. My hope, given the two dec\u00adades that have passed, is that we are now at a stage where we can untangle the complexities and context (maybe even with a little compassion), which might help lead to an eventual healing\u2014and a systemic transformation. As Haruki Murakami has written, \u201cWhen you come out of the storm you won\u2019t be the same person who walked in. That\u2019s what this storm\u2019s all about.\u201d Who were we then? Who are we now?\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so sorry you were so alone.\u201d Those seven words undid me. They were written in a recent private exchange I had with one of the brave women leading the #MeToo movement. Somehow, coming from her\u2014a recognition of sorts on a deep, soulful level\u2014they landed in a way that cracked me open and brought me to tears. Yes, I had received many letters of support in 1998. And, yes (thank God!), I had my family and friends to support me. But by and large I had been alone. So. Very. Alone. Publicly Alone\u2014abandoned most of all by the key figure in the crisis, who actually knew me well and intimately. That I had made mistakes, on that we can all agree. But swimming in that sea of Aloneness was terrifying.\n\nIsolation is such a powerful tool to the subjugator. And yet I don\u2019t believe I would have felt so isolated had it all happened today. One of the most inspiring aspects of this newly energized movement is the sheer number of women who have spoken up in support of one another. And the volume in numbers has translated into volume of public voice. Historically, he who shapes the story (and it is so often a he) creates \u201cthe truth.\u201d But this collective rise in decibel level has provided a resonance for women\u2019s narratives. If the Internet was a b\u00eate noire to me in 1998, its stepchild\u2014social media\u2014has been a savior for millions of women today (notwithstanding all the cyberbullying, online harassment, doxing, and slut-shaming). Virtually anyone can share her or his #MeToo story and be instantly welcomed into a tribe. In addition, the democratizing potential of the Internet to open up support networks and penetrate what used to be closed circles of power is something that was unavailable to me back then. Power, in that case, remained in the hands of the president and his minions, the Congress, the prosecutors, and the press.\n\nThere are many more women and men whose voices and stories need to be heard before mine. (There are even some people who feel my White House experiences don\u2019t have a place in this movement, as what transpired between Bill Clinton and myself was not sexual assault, although we now recognize that it constituted a gross abuse of power.) And yet, everywhere I have gone for the past few months, I\u2019ve been asked about it. My response has been the same: I am in awe of the sheer courage of the women who have stood up and begun to confront entrenched beliefs and institutions. But as for me, my history, and how I fit in personally? I\u2019m sorry to say I don\u2019t have a definitive answer yet on the meaning of all of the events that led to the 1998 investigation; I am unpacking and reprocessing what happened to me. Over and over and over again.\n\nFor two dec\u00adades, I have been working on myself, my trauma, and my healing. And, naturally, I have grappled with the rest of the world\u2019s interpretations and Bill Clinton\u2019s re-interpretations of what happened. But in truth, I have done this at arm\u2019s length. There have been so many barriers to this place of self-reckoning.\n\nThe reason this is difficult is that I\u2019ve lived for such a long time in the House of Gaslight, clinging to my experiences as they unfolded in my 20s and railing against the untruths that painted me as an unstable stalker and Servicer in Chief. An inability to deviate from the internal script of what I actually experienced left little room for re-evaluation; I cleaved to what I \u201cknew.\u201d So often have I struggled with my own sense of agency versus victimhood. (In 1998, we were living in times in which women\u2019s sexuality was a marker of their agency\u2014\u201cowning desire.\u201d And yet, I felt that if I saw myself as in any way a victim, it would open the door to choruses of: \u201cSee, you did merely service him.\u201d)", "images":
