She said that the liquid bandage New Skin was painfully applied after several of the takes. She said the stunt coordinator, who she did not name, told her the moleskin would be seen on camera.\n\n\u201cI looked like a mutant. My mom said, \u2018You\u2019ll never be able to wear an evening gown again!\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThe stunt in question involved rolling off a tree branch and then hanging above the ground (she was harnessed to the branch to prevent falling), the actress recalled. Lilly said that she did the stunt multiple times, and each time more skin ripped from her forearms.\n\n\u201cI felt it was him saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to put you in your place for standing up to me,\u2019\u201d Lilly said of the stunt coordinator. \u201cIt was either cow to his power or hurt myself. I was in my twenties then. Now, I would probably back down.\u201d\n\nA rep for ABC, Lilly and studio Bad Robot did not immediately respond to TheWrap\u2019s request for comment on the alleged incident.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/evangeline-lilly-lost.png?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dwts-s32-semifinals.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/evangeline-lilly-lost.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lessons-in-Chemistry-Harriet-Aja.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/the-masked-singer-cow.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Thomas-Augsberger.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/evangeline-lilly-lost.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Boucher", "Ross A.
