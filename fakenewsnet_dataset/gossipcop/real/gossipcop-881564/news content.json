That's why I'm fighting to the end, just like he did.\"\n\nAfter the pre-taped segment, Evie performed a touching and melancholy cover of Louis Armstrong's \u201cWhat a Wonderful World.\u201d Watch it here.\n\nShe received a standing ovation from the crowd, including her own family, and the judges were in awe of her strength.\n\nHowie Mandel told her, \"Our hearts and our souls go out to you, Evie. I know that your father passed this week, and I cannot believe the strength that I'm seeing in such a beautiful young girl. This is a very dark time your life\u2026 what gets us through is that light at the end of the tunnel. Your voice and your song and your presence here is that light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\n\nMel B, who recently lost her own father, said, \"I know you're dad's up there, looking down on you, and he must be so, so proud, because what you just did was beautiful. It was so pure and so raw.\"\n\nHeidi told her, \u201cI can't imagine what your family must be going through right now and I just want to say that you are one brave little young lady and one amazing singer.\u201d\n\nSimon Cowell called it the \u201cperfect tribute,\u201d adding, \"Your voice was beautiful, your song was beautiful and I'm very proud of you for what you've just done.\u201d\n\n\u201cExtra's\u201d Terri Seymour spoke with Evie after the show about her decision to return for the finals.\n\n\u201cI feel great that I came back,\u201d she said. \u201cI was really struggling whether I wanted to come back. I didn't talk to my family. I made the decision on my own.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cAt first when my dad passed away I was like, 'There is no way I'm going back. I cannot do this.' And when it was time for me to go I was like, 'I need to do this\u2026 Glad I was able to perform. I'm really grateful to be here.\u201d\n\nClair said she relied on her faith, \u201cI just prayed a lot that I would know what to do\u2026 I just had a really strong feeling I should come back and do this one more time.\u201d\n\nThe teen said the experience was an amazing ride, her favorite part being \"seeing everyone take me into their arms and just love our family and get to know us and help us.\u201d\n\nEvie says she isn't sure what she will do with the $1 million prize if she wins. \u201cI was going to use the money to find a cure for my dad, now I don't know what I would do.\u201d She said she wasn't expecting to make it past the quarter finals.", "images": ["https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/c2/3by2/2017/08/16/c213d3b001fa576db57258a199b24430_xs.jpg",
