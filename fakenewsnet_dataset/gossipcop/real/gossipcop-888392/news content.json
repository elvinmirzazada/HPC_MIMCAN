And yes, it is Oct. 20.\n\nInspiration for the video, of course, comes from Disney\u2019s Oscar-winning animated film, \u201cZootopia,\u201d directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, and featuring the spot-on voice work from Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin.\n\nIn the actual film, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) has only 48 hours to crack her first case, so she turns to scam-artist fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) for help. Their investigation takes them to the local DMV (Department of Mammal Vehicles), which is staffed entirely by sloths.\n\nThe new video finds several young customers giggling and pointing out neat quirks about the sloths \u2014 which struggle with paperwork and pressing the button to take driver\u2019s license photos.\n\nWhen one younger child tells his dad, \u201cI think it\u2019s a sloth,\u201d the dad responds, \u201cWhat\u2019s a sloth?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does he have a computer? How does he use the cup?\u201d the same youngster asks, befuddled.\n\n\u201cDo you have a supervisor?\u201d one customer asks.\n\nHuman DMV-goers are shocked to find themselves being assisted by slow-moving sloths in an \u201cOh My Disney\u201d clip, which was inspired by Disney\u2019s Oscar-winning feature \u201cZootopia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever you get a chance, just make this update,\u201d one tells the sloth, eyeing paperwork that will never be completed.\n\n\u201cHe looked like he was scratching his butt,\u201d an amused young customer announces.\n\nThe video then springs into serious customer confusion as the sloths attempt to take license photos.\n\nNear the end, the sloths take their allotted breaks.\n\nA sign reads, \u201cBreak Time! Attendant Will Return At:\u201d However, the paper\u2019s just covered in scrawls.\n\nIn the closing seconds, the sloths use their \u201cinterspecies bathroom\u201d and munch on some grub in the break room.\n\nThe \u201cOh My Disney\u201d videos essentially put real-life Disney scenarios to the test. An additional short follows Dug from the film \u201cUp\u201d (see below).", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NYDN-LOGO-WHITE-J.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NYDN-LOGO-WHITE-J.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Gunderman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/10/20/see-it-zootopia-dmv-scene-becomes-a-reality-as-sloths-take-over-office-in-youtube-short/", "title": "SEE IT: \u2018Zootopia\u2019 DMV scene becomes a reality as sloths take over office in YouTube short", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Take a number and be seated, it\u2019s going to take a while.", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "SEE IT: \u2018Zootopia\u2019 DMV scene becomes a reality as sloths take over office in YouTube short", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/10/20/see-it-zootopia-dmv-scene-becomes-a-reality-as-sloths-take-over-office-in-youtube-short/", "description": "Take a number and be seated, it\u2019s going to take a while.
