The clip is narrated by Ben and introduces their fellow townsfolk and their claims to fame, like a woman named Charlotte who makes the best punch bowl cake, and Jerry, who holds the record for anvil shooting.\n\n\"I hope you will watch his work,\" she says mentioning his production studio, Black Horn Productions. She also adds that she hopes followers, \"appreciate his talent that told all of our stories so beautifully, better than any of us ever could.\"\n\nThe series, which is in its second season, chronicles the efforts of Ben and Erin \u2014 who welcomed their first child, daughter Helen, in January \u2014 as they renovate historic homes in the area. Now with the loss of Davis, Napier says, \"Camp Home Town will miss him sorely.\"\n\n\"We are all better for getting to work with him and know him as a dear friend for as long as we did,\" she said.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/-T_aeUmsXHnTrIdjKa6r-lekvEs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/ben-napier-jones-college-040523-1-4b0a1bc7a08446be88b00a4f24087fc9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hRPM_JQJzg3PNSOJGrPPUIJllTY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x339:736x341)/Erin-Ben-Napier-030623-cf37ceda9cbc46609fab12d087a701a5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Pj-mTT9JHhfsFmrdWm3wTYnZQ24=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/benanderinnapier_hometown_seasontwo2-002-2000-f2fd158af2a344ae8d23592ac278eb58.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/oWL-H6njnSqwEkAxKAQuTCVyH0c=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(441x308:443x310)/erin-ben-napier-celebrate-100-home-town-episodes-042623-44a74c6226c04a7bac9e0cd9eccf5415.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rqpMkyPFotRDmYUCDuGkPy6dluY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/napier-2-111522-6574422fdd444fa9b9b32287c470aae5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/g3n11feveumqIb8fpaDCY9bpvoA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(636x1179:638x1181)/Napiers-Southern-Living-101022-05-2000-aada89f3b0514afda8e89f5a3a89dedf.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/8HiWUWP6McYSqvjU1-sUx47VTHs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/marrs-5-041823-74d1fa69cb4347b5a6f967ae8e1a0818.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ApRyBdUBffdkHrjMMiFuOxgSVkE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x278:981x280)/Erin-Napier-020623-add70da6d3884692b0065d9e68e5523b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/C-sWTPp6PjVF7XeQPVwMeTpzrE0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/napier-split-tout-111522-de1719daef004a7bbcdd205bdd3f4b54.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Z8lqIczGvH0FsmYCE87EdbK9aHs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Ben-and-Erin-Napier2-38be021c643b4e60858ce986714e91bc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KOwiXDOMntj8CIQYZJOLYAPmwKY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x158:1021x160)/HGTVs-Erin-and-Ben-Napier-in-the-discovery-holiday-feature-A-Christmas-Open-House-081722-0eb222fef1b94f22b885837caea078d7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/pISK71xYarKpTZDFg3gA2RqbiLg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x9:706x11)/Princess-Dianas-former-chief-of-staff-met-Erin-and-Ben-Napier-031023-2-1-5b0548a6ed3e4ccda934bb4ba01bb326.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7Uza53XcRYW2zru_1c0btPXZuR4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x518:1001x520)/erin-ben-napier-hometown-season5-promo-hgtv-3f4798625736499d985747f469a1ac4c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/YLj85bQw06FCYmQBcj6ycR4VfWg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/home-town-takeover-031523-1-c3960e08c5934b078e0cec135e9877dd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NE2AKEgHiIxJH64bOW3-lFRcj9k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/napier-cover-d6e32b7663234c0282b21d935b95f3cd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/aKs5Jvty5W3rdJxH22612G3qV18=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x273:676x275)/erin-ben-napier-2-95e9ea6bdf4447ff873222cad983228e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/BY0fidZUTELURsWHmkm5qyPgZyY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x9:736x11)/erin-napier-drew-barrymore-022123-8993904054c74e4d9e9182f920a65706.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/Pj-mTT9JHhfsFmrdWm3wTYnZQ24=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/benanderinnapier_hometown_seasontwo2-002-2000-f2fd158af2a344ae8d23592ac278eb58.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Stein", "Megan Stein Is A Former Associate Home", "Travel Editor At People.
