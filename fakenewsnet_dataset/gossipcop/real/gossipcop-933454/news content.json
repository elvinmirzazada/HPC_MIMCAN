So had to show her!\u201d\n\nKevin Mazur/MG18/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue\n\nLooking for more style content?

Kardashian West wore a custom chainmail Versace dress featuring crosses embroidered on the bodice and hip, in tribute to the night\u2019s theme of \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.\u201d\n\nPerry, 33, went with a very literal interpretation of the theme, donning gigantic angel wings with a gold metallic mini dress with chain long sleeves and matching over-the-knee boots.\n\nAmy Sussman/WWD/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAndrew H.
