But in 2013, shortly after North\u2019s birth, Kris Jenner dished on the significance of her granddaughter\u2019s directional moniker.\n\n\u201cI love the name North \u2014 I\u2019m pro North, absolutely,\u201d the Keeping Up with the Kardashians matriarch, 62, said on The View.\n\n\u201cThe way [Kim] explained it to me was that North means highest power and she says that North is their highest point together,\u201d she added. \u201cI thought that was very sweet.\u201d\n\nSource: Kim Kardashian West/Instagram\n\nNorth West\n\nEli Russell Linnetz\n\nKanye and Saint West\n\nAs far as the couple\u2019s second child was concerned, a friend of theirs told PEOPLE following Saint\u2019s birth in December 2015 that West was \u201cgoing back and forth for a while\u201d before deciding on his name.\n\n\u201cIt needed to mean something and he agonized over it, probably even more than Kim,\u201d said the pal. \u201cKanye believes that a name is extremely important and that it\u2019s the first sense of identity that we have.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe believes that people live up to their names, which is why he wanted a name with spiritual significance,\u201d the source continued, adding that West took the lead on naming North as well.\n\nAt the time, an E! News insider shared that the couple chose Saint because they viewed him as \u201ca blessing,\u201d especially considering \u201cshe had such a difficult pregnancy.\u201d\n\nKim Kardashian/Instagram\n\nSaint and Kim Kardashian West\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Lavish Lifestyle of the Kardashian Kids\n\n\n\nWest wasn\u2019t at all worried about his son\u2019s name sounding out of the ordinary. As the friend explained to PEOPLE, the rapper believed it would simply take time for people to get used to Saint.\n\n\u201cHe told me, \u2018Everyone freaks out, but you can get used to any name,\u2019 \u201d said the friend. \u201cBefore you know it, Saint West will seem normal, because that\u2019s just who he is.\u201d\n\nJenner seemed to be on the same page in 2013, pointing out on The View that North\u2019s full name wasn\u2019t an issue. \u201cYou don\u2019t walk around calling somebody North West \u2014 you just [call them by their first name],\u201d she said.", "images":
