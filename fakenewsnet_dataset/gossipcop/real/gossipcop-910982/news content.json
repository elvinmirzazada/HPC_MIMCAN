Going to high school, I\u2019d see Confederate flags on trucks,\u201d Boseman told MR PORTER when asked if he ever faced racism growing up. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be a kid at an ice-cream shop when some little white kid calls you \u2018n\u2014-r,\u2019 but your parents tell you to calm down because they know it could blow up. We even had trucks try to run us off the road.\u201d\n\nWhen Boseman, 41, had time off from filming the superhero film in Atlanta, he\u2019d drive two hours to visit his family in South Carolina, where he realized there is still progress to be made.\n\n\u201c\u2026 I would see the Klan holding rallies in a Walmart car park,\u201d Boseman said. \u201cSo it\u2019s like we\u2019re going forward and backward at the same time. People don\u2019t want to experience change, they just want to wake up and it\u2019s different. But this \u2014 shooting \u2018Black Panther\u2019 and then driving past the Klan \u2014 that\u2019s what change feels like.\u201d", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/72971091.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/serena-williams-72963750.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/72944522.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/chadwick-boseman.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/chadwick-boseman.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/taylor-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/chadwick-boseman.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/02/02/black-panther-star-chadwick-boseman-recalls-experiences-with-racism/", "title": "\u2018Black Panther\u2019 star recalls experiences with racism", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2023 NYP Holdings.
