Black Friday is fast approaching and we\u2019re working hard to find the best prices on the things you need. From the best Black Friday deals on baby gear and kids\u2019 essentials to must-haves for moms and dads, you\u2019ll find it all right here.\n\nAnd because it\u2019s no longer just a day (or two if you count Cyber Monday), many of the deals are already live. Who said you had to wait until after Thanksgiving to get shopping? From now through December, keep checking back for updates. We\u2019ll be sure to share them as we find them!\n\nThe best part? You don\u2019t have to leave your couch to check off those wish lists, mama.\n\nWhether you\u2019re shopping for gifts or just trying to score a deal on some of those big ticket items for Christmas, many top baby brands are having fantastic sales now through the holiday. Here are some Black Friday sales that you just can\u2019t miss.\n\nLooking for more gift ideas? Check out all of our holiday gift guides!\n\nBest Black Friday deals on baby gear 4Moms The tech-based baby brand is holding their biggest sale of the year from 11/14-11/28.

At once a bassinet, crib and built-in video baby monitor, it knows when your baby is about to wake up and begins to bounce ever-so-gently to lull them back to sleep. (After all, isn\u2019t that the exact movement you instinctively do to get them to sleep in your arms?) Paired with the Cradlewise app, you can check in on your little one from down the hall or across the country. You can also monitor their sleep and movement stats and play white, pink or brown noise to help them sleep more soundly. From now until 11/28 you can save up to $700 depending on your cradle delivery date. (It pays to plan ahead!)
