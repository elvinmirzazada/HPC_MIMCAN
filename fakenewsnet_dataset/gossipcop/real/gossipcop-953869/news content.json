His arrest came just 10 days after he and Cardi B welcomed their first child together, daughter Kulture Kiari.\n\nThe new mother, 25, shared a Boomerang of herself and Offset, n\u00e9 Kiari Kendrell Cephus, on her Instagram Story on Saturday after his arraignment.\n\n\u201cHome,\u201d she wrote in the caption as she sat on a chair and he stood over her in just a pair of yellow pants.\n\nIn another post, the \u201cBe Careful\u201d rapper set the record straight when it came to details of her husband\u2019s arrest.\n\nCardi B/Instagram\n\n\u201cFor the record Offset is NOT ON PROBATION,\u201d she wrote with an unamused emoji and an eye-rolling emoji.\n\nThe 26-year-old musician, who is a convicted felon, was pulled over in his 2014 Porsche 911 Carrera in Jonesboro, Georgia, on Friday. Officers spotted him performing an improper lane change, according to a police statement obtained by PEOPLE.\n\nAs officers approached his vehicle, they allegedly detected the smell of marijuana and proceeded to conduct a search. They found three handguns, less than an ounce of marijuana and more than $107,000 in cash.\n\nCardi B/Instagram\n\nOffset was charged with possession of marijuana (less than an ounce), possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, possession of a weapon during the commission of a crime and an improper lane change.\n\nHe was held at the Clayton County Jail on bond, which has been posted, his lawyer Drew Findling told PEOPLE.\n\nFindling said the rapper\u2019s main priority was his wife and their newborn daughter.\n\n\u201cHe is concerned, very concerned, about [Cardi B],\u201d he said. \u201cOf course his new baby is his top priority as well as his other children.\u201d\n\nFindling also said the Migos rapper was not guilty of any crime.\n\nMatt Baron/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cHe did not commit any traffic offense and he certainly was not in possession of any weapons,\u201d Findling told PEOPLE. \u201cThis was an improper arrest and I believe in his innocence.\u201d\n\nThe attorney added: \u201c[Offset\u2019s] holding up as best he can considering the circumstances and knows he has not broken any laws. He is going to have his day in court.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Cardi B and Offset Cozy Up as They Hit the Doctor\u2019s Office with Baby Kulture: \u2018Mom & Dad\u2019\n\nOffset\u2019s arrest follows a couple of big weeks for him. On June 25, Cardi B confirmed that she and Offset secretly tied the knot this past September, tweeting, \u201cWell now since you lil [nosy] f\u2014s know at least ya can stop saying I had a baby out of wedlock.\u201d Two weeks later, on July 10, daughter Kulture was born.\n\nShe\u2019s the first child for Cardi B and the fourth for Offset. He has three children from previous relationships: sons Jordan and Kody and daughter Kalea Marie.\n\nJust five days ago, Offset was seen cuddling with Cardi B, born Belcalis Marlenis Almanzar, during a doctor\u2019s visit for Kulture.", "images":
