With exactly 100 days until the opening ceremony, the Olympic torch has started its journey to Pyeongchang, South Korea and the USA team just got their first look at the official apparel of the games, all created by designer Ralph Lauren.\n\nThe iconic American brand is the official outfitter of the 2018 U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams for the sixth time in a row. It\u2019s designed uniforms for every Olympics since the 2008 Beijing Games, and it\u2019s continuing it\u2019s tradition of creating authentic all-American looks with a modern sensibility in all its upcoming designs.\n\nThe official closing ceremony uniforms were unveiled Wednesday morning on the Today Show by Olympic silver medalist Gus Kenworthy (freestyle skiing), Olympians Alex and Maia Shibutani (figure skating, ice dance) and Olympic gold medalist Jamie Anderson (snowboarding).\n\nThe official outfit features a white quilted water-repellant puffer coat, vintage ski-inspired red, white and navy blue crewneck sweaters, matching pants with a red racing stripe and an array of Americana-themed wool accessories, including gloves, hat and bandanna.\n\nThe good news is, you don\u2019t have to have to qualify for the Olympics to get your hands on the look. You can shop the Polo Ralph Lauren Team USA Collection in December in select Ralph Lauren and Polo Ralph Lauren retail stores and on RalphLauren.com and TeamUSAShop.com.", "images":
