The Gaineses refused to comment on the uproar, with Chip simply tweeting \u201cBe on your guard; stand firm in the faith.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: HGTV Homophobic hosts\u2019 show axed before debut\n\nIn 2014, HGTV pulled the plug on the show \u201cFlip It Forward\u201d in the middle of production when it was uncovered that the hosts, David and Jason Benham were fervently anti-gay. A video surfaced online of David talking about \u201chomosexuality and its agenda that is attacking the nation\u201d and advocating for a ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nPhoto credit: HGTV \u201cHouse Hunters\u201d is fake\n\nOne of HGTV\u2019s most popular shows, \u201cHouse Hunters,\u201d has long been rumored to be staged, but in 2012 one of the former home buyers featured on the show said her entire experience was staged by producers. In a statement addressing the controversy, the network later admitted to \u201cmanaging certain production and time constraints.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: HGTV \u201cProperty Brothers\u201d bar brawl\n\nJonathan Scott, one half of the brother duo behind the hugely popular \u201cProperty Brothers\u201d was thrown out of a North Dakota bar in 2016 after getting into a fight with the bouncer when his drink was taken away at closing time.\n\nPhoto credit: HGTV \u201cFlip or Flop\u201d scam classes\n\nAn AP report from Oct. 2016 found that lessons in how to flip houses offered by Christina and Tarek El Moussa were little more than a money-making scam. According to several attendees, the couple did not show up in person, and the classes quickly devolved into a sales pitch for other of the couple\u2019s products.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FlipOrFlop4-1.jpg?resize=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Reid-Nakamura.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/george-santos.jpg?fit=300%2C169&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Fixer-Upper.jpg?resize=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Reid-Nakamura.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/HGTV-Scandals.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Benham-Bros.jpg?resize=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/House-Hunters.jpg?resize=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/FlipOrFlop1.jpg?resize=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/selma-blair-meet.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/property-brothers.jpg?resize=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/george-santos.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/HGTV-Scandals.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-128377589.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Love-It-or-List-It.jpeg?resize=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/HGTV-Scandals.jpg?resize=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tiffany-haddish-special.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/HGTV-Scandals.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reid Nakamura", "Stephanie Kaloi", "Mike Roe", "Tv Reporter", "Reid.Nakamura Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Font-Family Libre-Franklin Sans-Serif Font-Size Line-Height Align-Items Center Letter-Spacing White-Space Pre .Wp-Block-Post-Author A Color", "Text-Decoration None .Wp-Block-Post-Author A Hover .Wp-Block-Post-Author A Focus Text-Decoration Underline .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Display Inline Font-Size Inherit Margin-Inline-End Width -Moz-Max-Content Width Max-Content .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Border Solid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/hgtv-scandals-photos/", "title": "7 Most Outrageous HGTV Scandals: From \u2018Property Brothers\u2019 to \u2018Flip or Flop\u2019 (Photos)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "7 Most Outrageous HGTV Scandals: From 'Property Brothers' to 'Flip or Flop' (Photos) - TheWrap", "description": "Including a bar brawl, a lawsuit and a show canceled before it even made it to air", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/hgtv-scandals-photos/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/HGTV-Scandals.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2016-12-21T21:53:37+00:00"}, "author": "Reid Nakamura", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Reid Nakamura", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "7 Most Outrageous HGTV Scandals: From \u2018Property Brothers\u2019 to \u2018Flip or Flop\u2019 (Photos)", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/hgtv-scandals-photos/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-12-21T13:53:37-08:00", "parsely-section": "news", "parsely-author": "Reid Nakamura", "parsely-tags": "christina-el-moussa, fixer-upper, flip-or-flop, hgtv, house-hunters, property-brothers, tarek-el-moussa", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1482357217.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
