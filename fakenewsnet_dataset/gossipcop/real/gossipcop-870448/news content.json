News, twirling around in a plunging rose gold gown.\n\nAs she slips into another option, her assistant and close friend Victoria Villarroel scrolls through her phone, looking up her own old prom pictures.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t even look like me!\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cWait, why didn\u2019t you go to prom?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was home-schooled,\u201d explains Jenner. \u201cIt was really sad, actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to unfollow all of my friends that I went to school with,\u201d she added. \u201cThey probably all thought I hated them \u2014 but I just couldn\u2019t see it. They would post photos and they were all at the prom and I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t see it.\u2019 It really just made me sad.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Rose Byrne Reveals the \u2018Rolls-Royce of Spanx\u2019 She Wore to the Met Gala\n\nThough fans won\u2019t get to watch the prom extravaganza unfold until Sunday\u2019s season premiere, the actual event took place back in April. Jenner made Sacramento high school student Albert Ochoa\u2019s celebrity dream date come true, accompanying him to the Rio Americano High School prom along with her longtime bestie Jordyn Woods.\n\nLife of Kylie premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on E!", "images":
