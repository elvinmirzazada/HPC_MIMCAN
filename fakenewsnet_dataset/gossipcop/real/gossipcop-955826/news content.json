Lawrence, 38, became engaged to the Dancing With the Stars pro dancer on May 3 -- her 34th birthday.\n\nShe said yes, obviously, and the two have been over the moon about it ever since.\n\n\"Congratulations on your engagement @matthewlawrence,\" Savage wrote on his Instagram account. \"So happy for you and @cherylburke.\"\n\nLawrence and Burke appear to be enjoying their engagement. Lawrence moved in with Burke in June, requiring a little... adjustment... of closet space.\n\n\"It's official! My fianc\u00e9 @cherylburke and I moved in together,\" Lawrence wrote on Instagram at the time. \"We realized I *might* just want somewhere to put my clothes, so she cleaned out her THREE closets, purging 300 items...\"\n\nAnd Burke is so thrilled she can't stop posting engagement pics on her Instagram account.\n\n\"Today was a great day! Hard work always pays off and I can\u2019t wait to share what I\u2019ve been working on with you guys!\" Burke wrote on Saturday. \"But, until I can, I\u2019m just going to spam you with my favorite pics from our engagement party #canthelpmyself.\"\n\nFor more on their relationship -- which included a decade-long break from one another -- watch the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-05%2Fmatthew_lawrence_cheryl_burke_gettyimages-949296914_1280.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-12/gettyimages-1063321470.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2Fcherylmatt.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/matthew_lawrence_cheryl_burke_gettyimages-949296914_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-07%2Feto_b09_cheryl_burke_072518.jpg%3Fh%3Dd1cb525d&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-03%2Fcheryl_burke_gettyimages-632041144_1280.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/matthew_lawrence_cheryl_burke_gettyimages-949296914_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/matthew-lawrence-reunites-with-boy-meets-world-co-star-ben-savage-to-celebrate-engagement-to-cheryl", "title": "Matthew Lawrence Reunites With 'Boy Meets World' Co-Star Ben Savage to Celebrate Engagement to Cheryl Burke", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/matthew_lawrence_cheryl_burke_gettyimages-949296914_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 38-year-old actor and his fiancee have been positively over the moon about their engagement.", "title": "Matthew Lawrence Reunites With 'Boy Meets World' Co-Star Ben Savage to Celebrate Engagement to Cheryl Burke", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/matthew-lawrence-reunites-with-boy-meets-world-co-star-ben-savage-to-celebrate-engagement-to-cheryl", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 38-year-old actor and his fiancee have been positively over the moon about their engagement.", "twitter": {"description": "The 38-year-old actor and his fiancee have been positively over the moon about their engagement.", "title": "Matthew Lawrence Reunites With 'Boy Meets World' Co-Star Ben Savage to Celebrate Engagement to Cheryl Burke", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/matthew-lawrence-reunites-with-boy-meets-world-co-star-ben-savage-to-celebrate-engagement-to-cheryl", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/matthew_lawrence_cheryl_burke_gettyimages-949296914_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Matthew Lawrence Reunites With 'Boy Meets World' Co-Star Ben Savage to Celebrate Engagement to Cheryl Burke | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Matthew Lawrence, Cheryl Burke", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
