It\u2019s unclear how his current situation will affect production, though the sudser tapes way in advance of air dates.\n\nIn a statement to Entertainment Tonight, St. John\u2019s ex-wife blasted early reports about the initial incident that led her ex to seek help.\n\n\u201cI want the world to know the truth about what is happening with Kristoff, because currently there is inaccurate, and fabricated information being reported by certain online outlets,\u201d said Mia St. John. \u201cNo parent should ever have to bury their child, and for those who do, it is a nightmare that haunts you forever. The death of our beloved son Julian has taken a toll on both of us. He is an actor and while he may appear whole on the outside, his heart is broken. As a society, we need to start taking mental health seriously and realize that no one is immune.\u201d\n\nSt. John\u2019s last tweet was on Oct. 12 to alert his followers about mental health awareness. His pinned tweet is about his son and wanting to seek \u201cvindication.\u201d\n\nSt. John has been on the CBS sudser since 1991.", "images":
