In fact, many of us are perfectly content with sticking with our normal style of dress, but wouldn\u2019t mind adding a small tweak or two to make things fun. Below, we\u2019ve rounded up some easy-to-replicate ideas about what to wear on New Year\u2019s Eve that are understated but also festive and wholly chic.\n\nWear your best shoes\u2014with jeans.\n\nThere\u2019s no hard-and-fast rule that says thou shalt wear cocktail attire on December 31. In fact, oftentimes the trick to looking like the most effortlessly stylish woman in the room is to take the opposite route by keeping your clothes basic\u2014think skinny jeans and a go-to blouse\u2014and adding your best shoes. So modern!\n\nRock a statement ear cuff\n\nThe beauty of the ear cuff is its ability to make any outfit look that much edgier\u2014a plus if you\u2019re wearing a cocktail dress or \u201cgoing out\u201d clothes.\n\nClip a flower in your hair\n\nDo like supermodel Sasha Pivovarova and add a clip-in flower to your hair. Don\u2019t worry about your tresses being perfect\u2014it looks much more modern on sexy, mussed-up hair. The beauty of this idea? You can walk into any H&M or Forever 21 and buy a pack of clip-in fabric flowers right now for under $5.\n\nSwap the LBD for a sleek black jumpsuit\n\nIf you\u2019re headed to a New Year\u2019s party, it\u2019s a safe bet that at least 25% of the women there will be rocking LBDs. Stand out from the crowd in a fashion-forward way with a fabulous jumpsuit instead. If you don\u2019t have one, and don\u2019t necessarily want to dash out and buy one before the 31st, fake it by wearing a great pair of black trousers, and your favorite black top\u2014a cami, a silk tee, a long sleeve blouse\u2014tucked in, and add a killer shoe.\n\nRock super-bold nails and lips\n\nNothing boosts your party look quite like a saturated matte red, orange or pink lip. Plus, it\u2019ll provide a nice antidote to the hordes of gold-and-glitter-makeup out there on the 31st. As for nails, we\u2019re big fans of keeping them in the same color family as your lipstick for a festive, notice-me look.\n\nAdd colorful earrings\n\nGlittery statement earrings are having a huge moment, and will instantly elevate any outfit.\n\nMake a hair statement\n\nPay a visit to your local salon (or braid bar, if your city has one) and opt for a messy fishtail braid. If you\u2019re really feeling daring, pick up some hair chalk or temporary color spray rock out with pink, lavender or blue.", "images":
