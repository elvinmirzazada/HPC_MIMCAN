(We didn\u2019t think so.)\n\nLevel of Difficulty: 2, if you factor in very mild pain and upkeep\n\nIt all started back in March, when Blanchett opened up about her skincare secret: a special facial at esthetician Georgia Louise\u2018s New York City skincare atelier, which Bullock turned her on to. She called it the \u201cPenis Facial\u201d \u2014 which, after further investigation, we learned got its name from the treatment\u2019s ingredients. And on Thursday\u2019s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Bullock explained not only why the treatment is so good, but also the reason behind the name.\n\nBullock explains that through a microneedling technique, the facial boosts collagen by enabling serums, including an epidermal growth factor (or EGF) serum to seep deeper into the skin. The serum, she tells DeGeneres, is \u201can extraction from a piece of skin that came from a young person far, far away.\u201d But as DeGeneres bluntly points out, the EGF is derived from \u201cforeskin from a Korean baby.\u201d\n\nYes, she\u2019s right. The serum is made from the foreskin of a baby\u2019s penis. As a representative for Louise explains, \u201cFor the Hollywood EGF Facial treatment, Georgia Louise uses her TCA peels, micro-needling machine and an electrifying mask to calm the skin, followed by her \u2018secret box\u2019 of EGF serum (Epidermal Growth Factor). EGF is derived from the progenitor cells of the human fibroblast taken from Korean newborn baby foreskin \u2013 which helps to generate collagen and elastin.\u201d\n\nFurther, Louise tells PeopleStyle of the FDA-approved serum, which uses skin collected during circumcision, \u201cI always explain that EGF is derived from newborn baby foreskin, BUT cells were taken [from the foreskin] and from that, new cells are cloned from a laboratory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m lying there with little pieces all over my face,\u201d Bullock tells DeGeneres. \u201cI call it the penis facial. And I think when you see how good it is to your face, you too will run to your local facialist and say, \u2018give me the penis.'\u201d\n\nAnd that, my friends, is exactly what I did \u2014 but instead of just any facialist, I went straight to the Louise\u2019s NYC spa to receive the exact treatment that Bullock and Blanchett have received. Spoiler alert: I didn\u2019t end up looking like them, but my skin looked pretty damn good for days afterward.\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez/Getty\n\n\u201cIt started last year when Sandra Bullock was filming in NYC and came to see me for a deep cleansing and long-lasting facial glow. I wanted to give her something that would transform her skin without the need to undergo lasers, so I loaded up her bespoke facial with something that would give her long lasting results,\u201d Louise says. \u201cI have text threads which would blow your mind from celebs, asking for the \u2018penis treatment\u2019 all the time now!\u201d\n\nI arrived at Louise\u2019s super-fancy spa on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, I sat down in the lobby, which is placed in the first floor of a chic brownstone, and was offered a cup of black tea in fine china. Fancy, I know. Eventually, I made my way back to the treatment room with my esthetician, Sarah, who explained that my skin would be red afterwards, and that I\u2019d have to abstain from wearing makeup for 24 hours, and steer clear of hot water or harsh products. I obliged.\n\nBut I soon learned that while it definitely would be one of the best facials I\u2019ll probably ever get in my life, it probably wouldn\u2019t be the most relaxing. Sarah cleansed my skin (this part was relaxing) and then applied a gentle chemical peel to sterilize my skin. Next came the numbing cream. She massaged it all over my face, and then had me lay under red and blue lights (they have great anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties, respectively) while the numbness kicked in. Soon enough, I couldn\u2019t feel my face \u2014 which meant it was time for the most important part of the facial: microneedling.\n\nThe microneedling machine is an electric wand with a dozen tiny needles at the end. Yes, it looks \u2014 and sounds \u2014 scary, but since I was numb, it wasn\u2019t so bad. Sarah pressed the needles into my skin in a linear pattern, poking teeny tiny holes into the surface of my face. While she did this, she applied the EGF serum \u2014 yes, the baby foreskin one \u2014 so that it penetrated immediately. The process took about 30 minutes \u2014 and while I was relieved that it was over, I was eager to see if I had yet morphed into Bullock during that time.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t done yet. Next, Sarah applied a second chemical peel, and then a thick liquid face mask that she even smoothed over my eyes and mouth. Since I couldn\u2019t see or speak, I motioned for her to take photos of me looking like a science project (above). Then, she hooked the edges of the mask up to an electrifying machine, which would send waves through my skin to lift, tone and soothe it. After that, she swiped on a few more serums and SPF and I was on my merry way.\n\nThe Verdict: As if the resounding \u201cyou look glowing\u201d from my coworkers didn\u2019t prove how good the results were, I must have looked in the mirror to examine my skin about 20 times upon arriving at work. There wasn\u2019t as much redness as I had expected, and I truly was glowing. My pores looked smaller, my cheekbones looked more defined, and the lines in my forehead that usually bug me were nowhere in sight. But beyond that, it felt smooth and firm for days. Since the experience, my usual redness has disappeared, enabling me to skip foundation, and there\u2019s still a radiance about my skin that wasn\u2019t there before. And while I certainly don\u2019t have the budget (or the time, for that matter) to get these on the regular like the Ocean\u2019s 8 cast, you better believe I\u2019ll be taking better care of my skin from here on out in hopes of maintaining the results. Thanks, Sarah (and you, too, Sandra!).", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/_1UZ1UB-ClzAhfOswIgxhVq0OKk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/PEO_BeautyAwards_SKIN_tout-4a240ac623294c3480e4e31457f808cb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ljYvtu4NGXBtAAS1zFNxKGrlreo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2999x0:3001x2)/PEOPLE-Editors-Picks--Best-Beauty-Products-July-2023-tout-0dc1b8ed922a4de2ac0e45226ecb796f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/mQr2Y9PSrWHDAQuNkhIqedcE7g4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2999x0:3001x2)/peo-best-foundations-for-mature-skin-tout-badge-f176b6f844e04d4f851362fee6136d8b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/GLUZKR4ZzXCVuH4w-P7oaP-WjC0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/peptide-serums-tout-1828dc2db3fb4194b79f5204e014b781.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jFWeUdc4DE-Gxn-ax4sDIf57mT0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2999x0:3001x2)/the-best-facial-cleansing-brushes-for-clear-soft-skin-tout-a800c83fe1be4fed87c1595439d26805.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZR6v1xV9eWGtVHuVTNZ--25-bXg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/vanessa-hudgens-know-beauty-tout-091223-a64cbeed77a442a4be6e779df6632da3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/aqt_o7uMcfo_HaVzs6VaUIWRYtA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2999x0:3001x2)/Best-Face-Sunscreens-Tested-PO-Social-8a6edf577e524c20a579649a55d26b86.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/SvReSfGuvI1njoqUp_ynDfAt2Vg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/sandra-bullock-2000-eae25fad22d3462f8e548f78c9fb634f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/oX7LiEHdwCc39__MQDQJSdiN-wY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2999x0:3001x2)/the-best-drunk-elephant-products-tout-970cfbc55a6946408ae760c1733dbb86.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/z2Q_9CsQ6Dn5DBRHCRZx2ZuMZ3c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(458x0:460x2)/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-1-e1526593119511-1eaae6b62b264d3bb46924486cbdedd2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ewB2liseXX88ywX5mwQDo7ZdS2k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(383x0:385x2)/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-2-c5289ec5da2546ef84e2b9f21dca94ee.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/XuVCIg9Uv-cRX7TB-VhvkIBzxE8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2999x0:3001x2)/peo-best-dermarollers-tout-21297745794b4006b8e5125061f75494.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/L2vfHUrTsPhMrc-cT2rpgz-5mic=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2999x0:3001x2)/Best-Acne-Products-of-2023-tout-6b9adf19cfcf4d59ae8796e576929ff7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/f2fF2Kv-CjpTS9JIh0lkMTA8www=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/cerave-brand-review-tout-8e2d19b0e5d84e369c889d4dd64b78bf.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Pq448CIOZ_6eJzKTCE5YKGpX9Nk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2999x0:3001x2)/the-best-overnight-face-masks-of-tested-and-reviewed-badge-new-tout-c6af986c44f1475da72ebdb1e7b0f02b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Mz6bFoAiG7VNu4g1H5kwVeuDkj8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2999x0:3001x2)/PEO-sheet-mask-group-shot_JESSICAJULIAO_0850-badge-5f084460a02f485491bcdc6a5c31aae1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qDzUnagMSUDqGGy7erpWNp74XpA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(383x0:385x2)/image_uploaded_from_ios_1024-25cece90e81546eaa234f6d3411dbf47.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/BmFMvCcAjw94JmDLfFbuzhs25Ig=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/ana-navarro-beauty-routine-072023-8ca7d5adb2b74f5a9d70c15f07d1df97.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4ABXBJKQrHNUra37Aj6JP_E6kgo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2999x0:3001x2)/Best-Hyaluronic-Acid-Serums-PO-Social-c0b81150e8b54f16b383faab515c8690.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/wO8u6oe1Y6dlB8GiU5OyBxVNDvk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1999x0:2001x2)/peo-tatcha-water-cream-oil-free-pore-minimizing-moisturizer-jjuliao-3550-1-e4c47c4ca5b44e378c296e32c08acd9b.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/SvReSfGuvI1njoqUp_ynDfAt2Vg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/sandra-bullock-2000-eae25fad22d3462f8e548f78c9fb634f.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jillian Ruffo", "Jillian Ruffo Is A Former Associate Beauty Editor At People.
