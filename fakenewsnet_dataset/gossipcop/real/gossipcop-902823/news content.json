legality [ edit ]\n\nBefore the first season went to air, an online petition calling for the series to be axed attracted over 15,000 signatures.[104]\n\nContestants have also criticised the show, such as second season participant Simone Lee Brennan described the program as \"never [being] portrayed to its full authenticity,\" suggesting the man she had been paired with, Xavier Forsberg, had been recruited by producers and was seeking a sports-presenting role rather than a relationship.[105]\n\nAt the show's commitment ceremonies, each contestant chooses to remain in the production or withdraw, the latter of which the contestant's partner must agree to mutually. This has been criticised as sending \"the worst possible message\" to people who may be in a toxic relationship.[106] Due to interpersonal complexities in Season 10, contestants Caitlin McConville and Josh White were permitted to withdraw without input from their respective partners.\n\nSome of the contestants of the show have also spoken out against the program claiming it to be fake,[107] including Dean Wells from Season 5.[108] Other former contestants have been abused in the street, received death threats online, attempted suicide, or been taken to a psychiatric hospital.[109]\n\nInternational [ edit ]\n\nBroadcasters [ edit ]\n\nIn The Netherlands the show is called \"Married at First Sight\" and is broadcast at primetime on RTL 4.\n\nIn Belgium the show is broadcast as Blind getrouwd - Australi\u00eb and runs every weekday on the Flemish channel VTM2.
