Now, he's told E! News that his drug habits date back to his time on the hit MTV reality show.\n\n\"I was watching [Jersey Shore] for the first time in years, and I was like, 'Oh my God! I was like that?'\" he said. \"And then again, like I said, I was wild. I was in my twenties, and I was using heavily.\"\n\nSorrentino, who is currently appearing on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition, said his worst struggle was during season four when the cast was in Italy.\n\nUp Next: Mike \u2018The Situation\u2019 Reveals Hilarious Jeopardy Answer In Screen Grab Photo\n\n\"When I watch certain seasons\u2014mostly Italy season\u2014it's hard for me to watch that one because I was coming at everyone for no reason apparent,\" he said. \"And it's because\u2014and a lot of people didn't know\u2014I was really heavily using. I didn't know how to control my emotions.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I was actually trying to get clean that year. It didn't really work, but I was trying that year. I was just agitated all the time...It was just a train wreck.\"\n\nSorrentino's sobriety has helped him put those anger-filled days behind him and start to move on in his life.\n\nMore: New Photo Of \u2019The Situation\u2019s Brother And Farrah Abraham Revealed: \u2018Laughing About Our Crazy Families\u2019\n\n\"[Being sober] really taught me how to be at peace. It taught me to be more accepting,\" he told us. \"I live my life today more at peace. I try not to have any arguments. I mean, everything in my life now has changed.\n\n\"I just live such a peaceful life\u2026I'm in a lot better place than I was maybe in my twenties.\"\n\nSorrentino's peace might have to wait a while. He is currently facing several tax fraud charges in a case that also involves his brother Marc.\n\n[h/t E!
