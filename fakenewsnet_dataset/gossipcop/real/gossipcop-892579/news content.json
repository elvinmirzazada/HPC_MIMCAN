From a gauzy yellow bubble-sleeved bandeau top to tiny sunglasses, there is no stopping the model from trying out of-the-moment pieces, and she's often one of the first to don a trend before it blows up. Case in point: animal print. It's poised to run the gamut come fall, as exotic patterns from leopard to snakeskin rendered in clothes and accessories were spotted on numerous fall 2018 shows.\n\nOver the weekend, the model demonstrated the trend as unexpectedly wearable (especially if you're a beginner with such statement pieces). Dressed in head-to-toe black, Hadid added a pop of interest to the sleek monochrome ensemble of bodysuit, ripped RtA denim, intentionally half-worn topper, Tommy Hilfiger leather boots, Gigi Hadid for Vogue Eyewear cat-eye sunnies and Versace mini bag with a snakeskin-printed belt by Streets Ahead.\n\nJames Devaney/GC Images\n\nThe wildlife-inspired accessory breaks up the one-shade outfit and lends a chic rock 'n' roll edge to the look. The one-step trick is the easiest way to keep an all-black outfit from being boring and wear the eye-catching trend without letting it wear you.\n\nCopy the blonde's getup by throwing on a snakeskin belt with your go-to black pieces from our selects ahead.\n\nASOS\n\nNew Look Snakeskin Effect Double Buckle Western Belt $13\n\nBanana Republic\n\nBanana Republic Snake-Effect Leather Trouser Belt $48\n\nMacy's\n\nMICHAEL Michael Kors Python-Embossed Leather Waist Belt $68\n\nYoox\n\nCantarelli Regular Belt $89\n\nStreets Ahead\n\nStreets Ahead Classic Snakeskin $129\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/gettyimages-1002941940-web.jpg?h=e1a4bcda", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-07%2Fnordstrom-anniversary-sale-celeb-style-gigi-hadid-meghan-markle-amal-clooney-1280.jpg%3Fh%3D14132037&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-07%2Fgettyimages-1002941940-web.jpg%3Fh%3De1a4bcda&w=1024&q=100", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-07%2Fkendall-jenner-two-matching-sets-paris-outfits-1280.jpg%3Fh%3Dc061fcf4&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-07%2Fgettyimages-1003937766.jpg%3Fh%3Ddc7ef19e&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/gettyimages-1002941940-web.jpg?h=e1a4bcda", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/gigi-hadids-one-step-trick-to-making-head-to-toe-black-not-boring-106581", "title": "Gigi Hadid's One-Step Trick to Making Head-to-Toe Black Not Boring", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/gettyimages-1002941940-web.jpg?h=e1a4bcda", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The model experiments with one of fall's biggest trends in the most wearable way.
