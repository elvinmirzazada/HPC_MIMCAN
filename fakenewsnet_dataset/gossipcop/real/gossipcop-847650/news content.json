She wasn't one of the first to arrive, but tweeted fans that she was \"on the way.\" Still, she proved it was worth the wait in a gorgeous gown, attending solo without husband Kanye West.\n\nWhile last year Kardashian went for a robot-chic look in a skin-tight metallic dress, this year she completely changed it up. The star is wearing a white, off-the-shoulder dress by designer Vivienne Westwood. We're not totally sure how it fits with the Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons theme, but it's pretty nonetheless.\n\nKardashian wears her bob sleek and straight, courtesy of stylist Michael Silva. Mario Dedivanovic did her makeup, of course. Like her dress, it's pretty and soft. We're drooling over her shimmery eyeshadow and pale-pink lipstick \u2014 both from Chanel. (The fact that she isn't wearing a shade from the KKW by Kylie Cosmetics lip collection is a bit of a miss though, TBH.)\n\nJamie McCarthy/Getty Images", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/63d738689293aa1c9c493c87/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5907e2387da179416ac6b4ed/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-675610540.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/654110336d0309c695cfd6ce/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5907e2387da179416ac6b4ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-675610540.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a6f8091ca1896741a1011fb/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/65524e227a3e35ea8af06aff/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/654a663971e99e9a520034f8/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/655cecd5e73ea278161b2885/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6543f5a166ac0a71e8d7612f/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5907e2387da179416ac6b4ed/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-675610540.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5907e2387da179416ac6b4ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-675610540.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Elizabeth Denton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/kim-kardashian-met-gala-2017", "title": "Kim Kardashian Looks Prettier Than Ever at the 2017 Met Gala", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Kim Kardashian hit the 2017 Met Gala red carpet Monday night without husband Kanye West, and looking stunning.", "id": "5907dee09ba3ba42d052403b", "keywords": "kim kardashian,vivienne westwood,met gala 2017,met gala", "news_keywords": "kim kardashian,vivienne westwood,met gala 2017,met gala", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5907dee09ba3ba42d052403b", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Kim Kardashian hit the 2017 Met Gala red carpet Monday night without husband Kanye West, and looking stunning.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5907e2387da179416ac6b4ed/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-675610540.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5907e2387da179416ac6b4ed/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-675610540.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Woah.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5907e2387da179416ac6b4ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-675610540.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Can We All Just Take a Moment to Appreciate Kim Kardashian at the Met Gala 2017", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/kim-kardashian-met-gala-2017"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-05-02T02:08:04.950Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-02T02:08:04.950Z", "author": "Elizabeth Denton"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "Woah.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5907e2387da179416ac6b4ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-675610540.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Can We All Just Take a Moment to Appreciate Kim Kardashian at the Met Gala 2017"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5907e2387da179416ac6b4ed/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-675610540.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493690884.95, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
