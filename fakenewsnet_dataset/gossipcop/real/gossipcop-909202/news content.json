Cute! Cute! 'Pregnancy may make cellulite look worse for a while, because the weight that you gain in pregnancy could make it more noticeable,'\" she wrote.\n\n\n\n\"I feel like I've always had cellulite but it's way more prominent at the moment ??\u200d\u2640\ufe0f,\" she added.\n\nBut on a positive note, Kardashian admitted that she does not have stretch marks, nothing she is \"happy about that.\"\n\nThe Keeping Up With the Kardashians star has been very vocal about her pregnancy, sharing her workout routines and how she's dealing with her cravings.\n\n\"During my pregnancy, I'm obviously not beating myself up about what I'm eating at all,\" she shared on her app. \"I'm more encouraged by how, after the baby comes, I'm going to work off every pound. I'm actually really excited to get my body back. I can't wait!\"\n\nKardashian has a couple more months until the arrival of her baby boy, but her big sis, Kim Kardashian West, recently welcomed her third child with Kanye West.\n\nLast week, the couple finally announced the name of their new daughter, Chicago, and to celebrate, the denim designer sent her big sis a stunning and massive pink flower arrangement that spelled out \"Chi.\"\n\nInstagram Stories\n\nFor more on Kimye's daughter's unique name, watch below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-03/khloe_kardashian_gettyimages-513509684_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2Fkhloe_shutterstock_editoria.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/khloe_kardashian_ellen.jpg?h=9a412f92", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fkhloe_kardashian_youtube.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fkhloe_kardashian_ellen.jpg%3Fh%3D9a412f92&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-12%2Fkhloe_tristan.jpg%3Fh%3D66a28218&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/khloe_kardashian_ellen.jpg?h=9a412f92", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-misses-her-pre-pregnancy-bod-muses-about-way-more-prominent-cellulite-95108", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Misses Her Pre-Pregnancy Bod, Muses About 'Way More Prominent' Cellulite", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/khloe_kardashian_ellen.jpg?h=9a412f92", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 'Revenge Body' host opens up about the way her body is changing during pregnancy in a series of social media posts on Thursday.", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Misses Her Pre-Pregnancy Bod, Muses About 'Way More Prominent' Cellulite", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-misses-her-pre-pregnancy-bod-muses-about-way-more-prominent-cellulite-95108", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 'Revenge Body' host opens up about the way her body is changing during pregnancy in a series of social media posts on Thursday.", "twitter": {"description": "The 'Revenge Body' host opens up about the way her body is changing during pregnancy in a series of social media posts on Thursday.", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Misses Her Pre-Pregnancy Bod, Muses About 'Way More Prominent' Cellulite", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-misses-her-pre-pregnancy-bod-muses-about-way-more-prominent-cellulite-95108", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/khloe_kardashian_ellen.jpg?h=9a412f92", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Khloe Kardashian Misses Her Pre-Pregnancy Bod, Muses About 'Way More Prominent' Cellulite  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Khloe Kardashian, Pregnancies", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
