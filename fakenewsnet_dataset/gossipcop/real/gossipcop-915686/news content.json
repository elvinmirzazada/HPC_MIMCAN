Sitting right here,\u201d Harrison says, as he gestures to her fellow cast members, inviting \u201cthe mystery man in Clare\u2019s life\u201d to stand up.\n\nAnd although Ben Higgins chooses that moment to dramatically uncross\u2014 and then re-cross \u2014 his legs, the clip ends before revealing which guy Clare found love with.\n\nTo find out who the lucky guy is, tune in to the season finale of Bachelor Winter Games, airing on Thursday at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/r63_2jACTTXOQzoH7kUsGJQUzI4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/clare-crawley-kiss-wounds-92122-7ce46a8d8abf4a58b48593dfa26b99d9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/eA5L1UiW5ZirtLNIzHQ8fvs3gLE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x239:751x241)/Clare-Crawley-2fb4a3f21a674aafabf511d1572ea779.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Sa6QVoZGMJvV-V5tFIsGBDTZezA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(551x254:553x256)/clare-crawley-1-b1739bdf4d1a4632aac2dd68cd2b2bb8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/W7UHr-kySK5KklJMOnnT86V4oiw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x797:1021x799)/clare-crawley-2000-93bc5f92652b4cf8976a0bac937ae11e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/UQw3PDVdNizn4wTb6dP-qjsXNsU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(293x0:295x2)/clare-crawley-1-e776157a7d6f47f185e8da64cefcf278.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NXyOM-n6B5WIQMxorU3LB3POKhI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(459x284:461x286)/clare-crawley-filming-bachelorette-4bed67249b884331bd7df526cdc3a363.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qyLxag_ramxHVN8mG47FoYPCtoE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(614x159:616x161)/clare-crawley-wedding-020223-4b71902bab574f02b750d399f7226d19.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/dhrcoqHVB6CdEX3Xyt3Rrapv7BU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(609x182:611x184)/clare-crawley-ryan-dawkins-101122-7-63bac152bd9a45a69ee9b98c61e609d7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ObksIO_4dOPUaaLc9xbk-MWyo3o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x451:751x453)/clare-crawley-1-4a4cdb3e11794c21abf0e63d1ccbd926.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/MXGt70Mm6T-2oma3tTJz8SjWeeQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x259:721x261)/THE-BACHELORETTEs-594d66a738fd48d78ff18fba9e5ba488.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HSZGe0plh7kxLEs8pwSWJDJQWHA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x680:921x682)/clare-crawley-dale-moss-1-dd72a630116f46c1b704dcd1ad1b8e7e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/L4mDSfkRn7BQfZ1UHc2Byfygxcg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x199:736x201)/Dale-Moss-clare-crowley-split-020523-7f508b9d9fa8491082aae77646c5bec1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hZZ5BPdpoQE3uUtPA2ES4ZyooNk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(386x629:388x631)/clare-crawley-ryan-dawkins-090622-1-102f545669944dbea8ad78627ecc483c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/EO-dTHn0lHGPJ22hDEvSx-OanyU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x299:736x301)/clare-crawley-dale-moss-a180371600024736a6a2dc9861287ee9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/aQM3T7jQAC9bIi-rGhP3NSnD2ig=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x329:721x331)/clare-crawley-dale-moss-0bae2779c3a74516937c12e85ca70535.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/UQw3PDVdNizn4wTb6dP-qjsXNsU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(293x0:295x2)/clare-crawley-1-e776157a7d6f47f185e8da64cefcf278.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Staff Editor For Human Interest S Digital Vertical At People.
