The date of separation, as well as the division of property and any spousal support, is still to be determined.\n\nThe divorce filing was originally reported by TMZ.\n\nThe former couple filed mirror-image paperwork and they each filed \u201cin propria persona\u201d \u2014 which means without an on-the-record attorney. Both Affleck and Garner noted that they will keep any earnings they made since they separated, so the separation date they determine could affect the settlement. They announced their split on June 30, 2015.\n\nA source tells PEOPLE the filing is \u201csuper amicable.\u201d\n\nA separate source adds, \u201cThey always planned to divorce despite what people said. If you look at their first statement it says divorce not separate. They just did it the way they wanted to and did what was best for their kids. There was no catalyst, it was just time. Nothing has changed, they are and still will be putting their kids first.\u201d\n\nAffleck and Garner have been in mediation and are working with leading L.A. divorce attorney Laura Wasser, according to another source. Wasser has handled divorce cases of several A-listers including Angelina Jolie, Johnny Depp and Kim Kardashian.\n\nAffleck and Garner broke off their 10-year marriage in June of 2015, telling PEOPLE in a joint statement, \u201cAfter much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce. We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding.\u201d\n\nOver the following months, Garner and Affleck, both 44, sometimes sparked reconciliation rumors as they continued to live together, vacation together and co-parent their kids \u2014 Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, almost 5 \u2014 while also stepping out for solo outings.\n\nThe friendly exes have been spotted out frequently during the last few months, including a sighting on Election Day in L.A. where they were both seen wearing \u201cI Voted\u201d stickers after casting their ballots. The actors also spent the holidays together with their kids in Montana, with a source telling PEOPLE they \u201cseemed to have a great time.\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: You Don\u2019t Need Superpowers to be Batman\u2013Just This Much Money\n\nAffleck called Garner the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest mom\u201d at a TimesTalk in New York in mid-December while saying that the births of their children were the most defining moments of his life. \u201cIt\u2019s a joy to hang out with them,\u201d he added. \u201cI think the meaning of life is to make good people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are co-parenting the best they can,\u201d a source who knows both of them told PEOPLE. \u201cWhatever incarnation of a relationship this is works for them.\u201d\n\nAfter completing rehab for alcohol addiction earlier this month, Affleck has been enjoying spending time with the kids. In fact, the morning after he announced he had completed rehab, things were business as usual as he was spotted taking his kids to school with Garner. A source told PEOPLE that the actor is relishing time with his children.\n\n\u201cBen is spending special time with all the kids separately,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe seems very happy. The mood in general seems very upbeat. The kids are thrilled that he is back.\u201d", "images":
