I gave it to her because she has my heart and that is the most precious thing I own. My dad would be so happy and love her so much,\u201d Davidson said of his fianc\u00e9e to his followers.\n\nHowever, some social media users claimed Davidson also gave the same necklace to his ex-girlfriend Cazzie David.\n\n\"It's so ridiculous that he gave it to his ex and said the same thing,\u201d one person commented.\n\nDavidson shut down the claims explaining that he did give David a pendant but it was a replica of his father\u2019s.\n\n\"Actually, I didn't give that to my ex. Yes, she had one, but it was a replica,\u201d Davidson replied.\n\nKELLY CLARKSON TO HEADLINE U.S. OPEN TOURNAMENT OPENING CEREMONY\n\n\"I had a bunch of replicas made. My sister and grandpa also have one. The one that Ari has is the one my dad actually died in and the one he wore his entire career and the one I've worn for over 17 years. I've actually never taken it off other than for \u2018SNL\u2019 or for work. So it means a lot to me. Hope this helps. Please learn to be nicer and not to assume the worst in people. It\u2019s a terrible way to live. Much love,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter weeks of speculation, Davidson announced his engagement to singer Grande last month. Following their engagement announcement, the two have been spotted together. People reported Grande had Davidson\u2019s father\u2019s badge number tattooed to her foot.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/19408c91-2846-498f-8746-68c777431ca4/dc66da8e-d2ab-488b-9e20-23b2d396fc54/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/pete20davidson20ariana20grande.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/683a7afc-c45b-45d1-a66e-c2bf3c642000/eb427261-ddd9-47ac-b6b3-dc3323584be5/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/1b7923a2-2827-4275-b995-744d798cec60/2b91178d-146a-4dad-b944-0c6aa604b9bc/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/Royal_Family.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/pete20davidson20ariana20grande.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/560a8fea-9cd0-47f9-8178-596cc0e8d016/6905e13d-6013-4683-b922-023ad181ce11/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/2ec327ae-Taylor_Swift_Travis_Kelce.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_ENT-532x120.png"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/pete20davidson20ariana20grande.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Joyce"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/pete-davidson-says-he-didnt-give-ex-cazzie-david-his-dads-necklace-before-gifting-it-to-ariana-grande", "title": "Pete Davidson says he didn't give ex Cazzie David his dad's necklace before gifting it to Ariana Grande", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "description": "\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Pete Davidson clarified claims that he gave his fianc\u00e9e Ariana Grande and his ex-girlfriend Cazzie David the same necklace;
