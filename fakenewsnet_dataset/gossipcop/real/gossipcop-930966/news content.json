Rosie Huntington-Whiteley\u2019s go-to makeup artist, Katie Jane Hughes (who you\u2019ve might\u2019ve seen giving tutorials on Glossier\u2019s instagram) just revealed an affordable and easy hack for brightening your skin and concealing dark circles along the way.\n\nThe common assumption about under-eye concealer is that it should be a few shades lighter than your natural skin tone, but Hughes recently told Allure those bright pinks and stark lights can actually create \u201ca much muddier version of what you already have under your eyes.\u201d Instead, do like Hughes, and place your finger halfway between your nose and the apple of your cheek. That otherwise insignificant area is \u201cthe most neutral-toned part of your face,\u201d and your new color-match spot for concealer.\n\nNow that you know your shade, it\u2019s time to pick a concealer. One of Hughes\u2019 top three picks is the Innisfree Matte Full Cover Concealer, which lucky for everyone, is only $8. It comes in 14 different shades and uses all natural ingredients. Fun face: Innisfree is a favorite in the K-beauty circles, due to its eco-conscious ingredients, which are exclusively and ethically sourced from the Jeju Island in Korea.\n\nTime to say goodbye to dark under-eye circles, hello to a seamless blend, and more money in our pockets. That\u2019ll make mornings a little easier, no?", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetabercrombiejeans.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/root-cover-up-fi.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rosie-huntington-whiteley.jpg", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Moore.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/01_KV-1-1.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kleemorganicseyecream.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ayaneo-mini-pc.webp?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lush-advent-cal.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ytp-eye-cream-fi.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Taylor-Swift.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetsweaterset.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/daisy-jones-and-the-six.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RemiBader_Homepage.webp?w=244", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/katie-s-e1505443415270.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nativaspa-cyber-monday.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/luke-mitchell-chicago-med.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://spy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sdfgve.png?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rosie-huntington-whiteley.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ulta-hair-sale.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uggdupestarget.gif?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lush-advent-cal.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/olivercabellsneakersale.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bestprodsforthinninghair.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rosie-huntington-whiteley.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Stanovick"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/beauty/makeup/730650/rosie-huntington-whiteley-makeup-artist-k-beauty-concealer/", "title": "The $8 K-Beauty Concealer Rosie Huntington-Whiteley\u2019s Makeup Artist Loves", "meta_data": {"description": "There's been tons of speculation on how to rid of dark circles under the eyes.
