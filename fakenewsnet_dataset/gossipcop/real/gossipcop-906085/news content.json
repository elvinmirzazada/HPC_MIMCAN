Hulu has released a first look at its upcoming adaptation of Joseph Heller\u2019s Catch-22: a new round of photos featuring Clooney himself (taking a break from executive producing and directing), as well as Girls alum Christopher Abbott, Friday Night Lights fave Kyle Chandler, and more.\n\nDebuting in spring 2019, the six-part limited series sees Abbott playing World War II Air Force bombardier Yossarian, who wants desperately to finish his service and leave military life behind. But requirements for his discharge are continually changing, and there\u2019s a \u201chilariously sinister\u201d Catch-22 rule that prevents servicemen from citing mental health as a reason to depart. As the series\u2019 synopsis puts it, \u201ca man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but a request to be removed from duty is evidence of sanity and therefore makes him ineligible to be relieved from duty.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Abbott\u2019s role as Yossarian, Catch-22 also features Chandler as Colonel Cathcart, Clooney as Scheisskopf, House star Hugh Laurie as Major de Coverley, as well as additional cast that includes Giancarlo Giannini, Daniel David Stewart, Rafi Gavron, Jon Rudnitsky, Tessa Ferrer, Julie Ann Emery and more. Clooney executive produces with Grant Heslov for Smokehouse Pictures, and Richard Brown and Steve Golin of Anonymous Content. Luke Davies and David Mich\u00f4d co-write and executive produce, while Clooney, Heslove and Ellen Kuras each direct two episodes.\n\nFor the moment, Hulu has yet to set an official premiere date beyond this coming spring. In the meantime, we\u2019ll have to make due with these images\u2014which show Abbott\u2019s dreamy Yossarian, Laurie casting shade worthy of Dr. House, more of Clooney\u2019s mustache and the ensemble cast as Yossarian\u2019s fellow servicemen.\n\nCourtesy of Hulu.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/631f80b4c1df471d836f1bb1/1:1/pass/undefined",
