Pippa served up major style inspiration once again, this time opting for a cream-colored Isabel Marant \u00c9toile dress, white fedora and tan wedges. Her designer one-piece, which retails for $490, is nearly sold out!\n\nThe newlyweds were spotted holding hands and smiling as they shared loving embraces. Also on Friday, Pippa\u2019s mother, Carole Middleton, and brother, James Middleton, were spotted at Center Court cheering on their family friend Roger Federer, who advanced to the men\u2019s finals after beating Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych. Sitting right in front of them was actor Bradley Cooper.\n\nMiddleton and Matthews have spent the seven weeks since saying their \u201cI Dos\u201d at St. Mark\u2019s Church on May 20 on a tour of love \u2014 first boarding a plane to a private getaway in French Polynesia and then touring a variety of areas in Australia.\n\nIn June, the couple made their first public post-wedding appearance at a friend\u2019s nuptials in Stockholm, Sweden.\n\nThe pair first dated in 2012, split for a few years, and then got back together. A hedge fund and chief executive of Eden Rock Capital Management Group, Matthews popped the question to Middleton in July 2016 in the picturesque Lake District of northwest England.", "images":
