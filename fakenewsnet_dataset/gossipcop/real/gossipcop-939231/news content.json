I think I've learnt as I've got older to just to sit with it, anything that's uncomfortable.\"\n\nThe actress continued: \"Winston Churchill used to say that depression is like a black dog that he used to sit with. I kind of feel like that about it now, it just sometimes is here.\n\n\"Instead of going 'I'll just deny it', I think a lot of people do that \u2013 and they're like 'It's fine, everything's fine' \u2013 when actually it's alright to just sit it in and when you come out of it the better things feel better.\"\n\nSteve Granitz/WireImage\n\nBear then suggested that people assume celebrities have it \"all buttoned up and together\" before adding that he believes it's a \"great lie\" as everyone's just trying to live their life.\n\n\"It's not all smooth sailing, but it makes it interesting,\" Lena added.\n\nAfter their talk, Bear described the Game of Thrones star as \"authentic, honest and vulnerable\", praising her mental strength.\n\nThis isn't the first time Lena has spoken about her mental health struggles, telling a fan on Twitter last year: \"I overthink for sure. I am familiar with depression. I get HUGE anxiety (always fun) Insecure, not really.\"\n\nShe then wrote a series of tweets on the subject, adding in another: \"Anxiety is a beast. You have to talk to beasts. Release them back into the wild. Easier said than done I know but still. Good to Practice.\"\n\nGame of Thrones returns in 2019. The show airs on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic and in the UK. Season 7 is now available to buy on , or .\n\nReaders affected by the issues raised in this story are encouraged to contact Samaritans free on 116 123 (www.samaritans.org) or Mind on 0300 123 3393 (www.mind.org.uk).
