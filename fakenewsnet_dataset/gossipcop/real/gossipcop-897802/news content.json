People seem to think my Twitter is a fan account for that relationship,\u201d she explained on The Late Late Show with James Corden in November 2017.\n\nShe added at the time: \u201cIt\u2019s just weird because Camila Mendes is a very popular name in Brazil \u2026 but they seem to think I\u2019m just a verified fan account \u2026 I just didn\u2019t even know that was a thing so I don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nAlthough Camila isn\u2019t close to her namesake, Joey King previously noted that she was on great terms with Jaime King, even though they aren\u2019t related.\n\n\u201cLiterally, her closet is the greatest thing in the world. A lot of people think we\u2019re related too. We\u2019re actually not. But we want to be,\u201d the Kissing Booth star told WWD in August 2016. \u201cWe went out to breakfast or lunch one time and I had on this like vintage dress. It was fine. She had these Chanel overalls on. I\u2019m like, \u2018Dude. Kill me. Get out of that. I look stupid next to you.\u2019 She was like, \u2018What?\u2019 And she had her cute little baby bump. I was like, \u2018Stop. Looking so cute all the time.'\u201d\n\nCamila and Joey join other stars that probably deal with the same exact confusion from their fans.\n\nTake Selena Gomez, for example. She shares a last name with Spanish pop singer Becky G, but they aren\u2019t family members.\n\nWhat about Ross Lynch? He\u2019s got the same surname as Harry Potter star Evanna Lynch \u2014 but no, they\u2019re not siblings either.\n\nAnd Stranger Things star Gaten Matarazzo and The Princess Diaries actress Heather Matarazzo don\u2019t share any genes, contrary to popular belief!\n\nThere are plenty more where that came from!\n\nScroll through our gallery to uncover all the other pairs of celebrities who have the same last name but aren\u2019t related \u2014 and prepare to be shook.\n\nLove J-14?
