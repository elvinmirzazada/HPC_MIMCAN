However, one measure that many overlook is net worth.\n\nYour net worth represents how much wealth you have, measured by assets like a house, cars, 401(k), jewelry or cash in the bank, minus the debt obligations you have, or what you owe. When you understand your net worth, you can make better decisions about what you do with your money, as well as get a clearer picture of how close you are to accomplishing your goals.\n\nWhat is net worth?\n\nIn general, your net worth is your personal balance sheet. It\u2019s a way for you to get a snapshot of where your finances stand right now. Basically, it\u2019s a measure of what you own minus what you owe to others.\n\n\u201cTracking it gives you a good measure of whether you\u2019re headed in the right direction with a growing net worth,\u201d says Crystal Rau, CFP, founder of Beyond Balanced Financial Planning.\n\nAs you move forward in your financial journey, the goal should be to increase your assets while decreasing your liabilities. The greater your assets, the greater your wealth \u2014 and this is especially true if you have fewer debt obligations weighing you down.\n\nHow to figure out net worth\n\nThe basic formula to calculate your net worth is to add up all of your assets, and then add up all of your liabilities. Once you have those two numbers, subtract your liabilities from your assets. That number is your net worth.\n\nAssets\n\nYour assets are the things you own. They are items of value, as well as items that can potentially provide income down the road.\n\nAssets that you should add up include:\n\nCurrent market value of real estate: This includes the market value of your home, as well as any rental properties or other properties you own.\n\nThis includes the market value of your home, as well as any rental properties or other properties you own. Current market value of your vehicles: Current value of all your vehicles, including cars, boats, motorcycles and other vehicles.\n\nCurrent value of all your vehicles, including cars, boats, motorcycles and other vehicles. Value of your items of significant value: Consider any fine artwork, collectibles, antiques and jewelry that you have.\n\nConsider any fine artwork, collectibles, antiques and jewelry that you have. Cash value of your bank accounts: Tally up all the money you have in your savings and checking accounts, as well as certificates of deposit.\n\nTally up all the money you have in your savings and checking accounts, as well as certificates of deposit. Market value of your investment accounts: Balances of your brokerage accounts. Your 401(k) and IRA should be included in your net worth calculation.\n\nYou can find information about the current market value of some of the assets you own, such as collectibles, by looking on eBay, and using Edmunds or Kelley Blue Book to determine the current value of your vehicles.\n\nLiabilities\n\nLiabilities represent what you owe to others. You should add these up and subtract them from your assets.\n\nMortgages: Outstanding balances on all your property loans, including what you owe on the mortgage of your primary residence, home equity loans, as well as what you owe on rental properties.\n\nOutstanding balances on all your property loans, including what you owe on the mortgage of your primary residence, home equity loans, as well as what you owe on rental properties. Vehicle loans: Any money you owe on a car, boat or other vehicle.\n\nAny money you owe on a car, boat or other vehicle. Credit card debt: Total all of your credit card balances.\n\nTotal all of your credit card balances. Personal loans: Any loan you have from an online lender, payday lender, bank or other financial institution.\n\nAny loan you have from an online lender, payday lender, bank or other financial institution. Student loans: Everything you owe on private and federal student loans.\n\nEverything you owe on private and federal student loans. Medical debt: Unpaid medical bills, or a payment plan for medical bills \u2014 even if you aren\u2019t paying interest.\n\nUnpaid medical bills, or a payment plan for medical bills \u2014 even if you aren\u2019t paying interest. Back taxes and liens: If you owe back taxes, have a payment plan with the IRS or have a lien against any of your property, those amounts should be considered liabilities.\n\nAs you might expect, it\u2019s possible that you might have more liabilities than assets after making this calculation. If this is the case, you have a negative net worth. Your goal should be to pay down debt and boost savings to help you bring your net worth above zero.\n\nIf you want a little guidance as you figure out your net worth, a net worth calculator can help you include all the relevant assets and liabilities \u2014 and do the math on your behalf.\n\nWhat is a good net worth?\n\nAccording to the most recent Survey of Consumer Finances from the Federal Reserve, the median net worth for an American family is $192,900. However, for households headed by someone age 35 or younger, the median net worth was just $39,000. It grew to $335,600 for those age 75 and older. However, the \u201caverage\u201d net worth of a U.S. family was $1,063,700, the Fed survey found.\n\nDuring your lifetime, your net worth will fluctuate, depending on what kind of debt you have, how much your home has grown in value and how much you have in your retirement account. As your finances improve and as you pay down debt, you should see an increase in net worth.\n\nBut what makes a good net worth?\n\nA 2023 Charles Schwab survey points out that many Americans believe a net worth of $2.2 million is needed to be considered \u201cwealthy.\u201d However, not everyone thinks you need to have more than $2 million to have a good net worth.\n\n\u201cReally, it\u2019s about the experiences you want to have and the freedom to pursue those experiences,\u201d says Todd Tresidder, a former hedge fund manager, financial coach and founder of Financial Mentor. \u201cA good net worth is one that allows you the flexibility to live your life comfortably and in a way that enriches you.\u201d\n\nYou can compare yourself to others using net worth, Tresidder continues, but tracking your net worth should be more about comparing your current self with your past self. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to measure your own financial progress, and you\u2019re the only person you should be competing with,\u201d he says.\n\nThere are some time-tested ways to boost your net worth.\n\n\u201cA growing net worth is a sign that you are making smart decisions,\u201d Rau says. \u201cDecisions like saving a portion of your paycheck, growing your investments or paying down debt are all going to improve your net worth.\u201d\n\nHow to use your net worth\n\nKnowledge of your net worth can be a useful tool to help you see where you stand today as compared to where you were a year ago or a decade ago. Additionally, net worth can also provide you with a reality check when it comes to determining whether you\u2019re on track to reach your financial goals.\n\nTresidder suggests that you calculate your net worth on a regular basis. \u201cDecide how often you want to measure your net worth, whether it\u2019s monthly, twice a year or annually,\u201d he says. \u201cThe key is to check your net worth at the same time in the cycle. If you look at it at the first of the month, your next calculation should also be the first of the month.\u201d\n\nFor many people, income, investment contributions and debt payments are all made on a schedule, so checking in at the same point in the schedule makes sense. It allows you to compare apples to apples.\n\nIf your assets and liabilities don\u2019t show you what you want to see, you can use that information to change course and improve your financial picture. When you see a lot of liabilities dragging your net worth down, working on growing your assets or reducing your debt can help you improve your financial health.\n\nYou can also use your net worth to reinforce good habits. When you\u2019re hitting your goals, you can see what you\u2019re doing right \u2014 and feel encouraged to keep pressing forward.\n\n\u2014 Bankrate\u2019s Brian Baker contributed to an update of
