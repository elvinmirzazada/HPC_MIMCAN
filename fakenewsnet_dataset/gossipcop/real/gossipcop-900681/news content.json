In 2013, she was diagnosed with Stage 2 Endometrial Cancer and underwent a radical hysterectomy. She is currently in remission and has dedicated the past few years to spreading awareness about the below-the-belt cancers as a spokesperson for the Foundation for Women\u2019s Cancer.\n\nLike her Endometrial Cancer, Grammer\u2019s Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) was found below the belt as well.\n\n\u201cCancer really stinks,\u201d Grammer told PEOPLE. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate it runs in my family. I was diagnosed with Lynch Syndrome 15 years ago, so I have a genetic disposition to cancer. My mom had it also and her mom and unfortunately, these cancers seem to come along with the territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly detection is key,\u201d Grammer added, explaining that SCC can show up anywhere from the skin to the lung to your throat. \u201cMany people, if something shows up like this, they\u2019ll ignore it. They\u2019ll think, \u2018Oh it\u2019s a mole, it\u2019s a pimple, it\u2019s a rash, it\u2019s an ingrown hair from shaving.\u2019 \u2026 This isn\u2019t an aggressive cancer, but if it goes undetected, it could spread and metastasize to the lymph nodes and other organs close to the area. I\u2019m lucky we found it early.\u201d\n\nTommy Garcia/Bravo\n\nWhile she admitted the location of her latest scare was \u201ca little embarrassing to talk about,\u201d Grammer made it clear she wanted to \u201clift the vail of shame\u201d from below-the-belt cancers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important for women to go for check-ups,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore these symptoms. We can\u2019t ignore signals that our bodies are giving us when something is wrong. I\u2019m a spokesperson, and advocate of awareness. So when anything comes up on our bodies \u2014 if it\u2019s skin cancer or a bump or something we\u2019re not certain of \u2014 we need to see our doctors. Go in, make an appointment, see our physicians, and don\u2019t ignore these symptoms. When they present, don\u2019t sweep them under the rug like so many of us do.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Tamra Judge Delays Bodybuilding Competition After Discovering More Skin Cancer: \u2018Get Your Skin Checked\u2019\n\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma, or SCC, is the second most common from of skin cancer, the Skin Cancer Foundation reports \u2014 and it is usually caused by cumulative ultraviolet exposure over the course of a lifetime. SCCs often appear as scaly red patches or elevated growths. More than 1 million cases of squamous cell carcinoma are diagnosed each year in the U.S., and (depending on different estimates) as many as 8,800 people die from the disease.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how exactly I got it, but listen \u2014 I used to go to tanning beds. As a teenager, those were so popular,\u201d Grammer said, clarifying that she\u2019ll have to wait about a week for pathology reports to come back to learn whether the SCC falls under the Lynch Syndrome umbrella,. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the cause, I don\u2019t know what the cause is. Some people think it\u2019s from the HPV, but my pap-smear came up negative for HPV. Again, there\u2019s no clear certain reason why this showed up in this case. But it\u2019s better to get checked.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday morning, Grammer shared a photo of herself at Cedars-Sinai hospital smiling next to her \u201camazing\u201d surgeon Dr. Beth Karlan. \u201cMy cancer was removed and I\u2019m resting at home,\u201d she wrote. \u201cLadies listen to your bodies. If something doesn\u2019t seem right go for a checkup. Don\u2019t put it off. Annual check ups are important.\u201d\n\nCamille Grammer\n\nWhile she waits two weeks to heal and resume physical activity, Grammer will have a strong place of support by her side: fianc\u00e9 David C. Meyer \u2014 whom she has been dating for more than a year after meeting him in Malibu, where Meyer lives and works as a lawyer (He popped the question back in October).\n\nTurns out, Meyer too recently had an SCC removed from his temple. \u201cWe were both laughing about this,\u201d Grammer told PEOPLE. \u201cWith sun exposure, be careful. Protect yourself from the sun and get checkups!\u201d\n\nThis will be the second marriage for both. Grammer (n\u00e9e Camille Donatacci) wed Frasier actor Kelsey Grammer in August 1997; their divorce was finalized in February 2011. The Grammers share two children: daughter Mason, 16, and son Jude, 13.\n\nGrammer is also returning to RHOBH on Tuesday as a friend of the Housewives for the season 8 premiere, something she said she\u2019s excited about because she gets to use the platform to help education more women about fighting cancer.\n\n\u201cBeing a spokesperson for cancer awareness has been a passion of mine,\u201d Grammer said. \u201cIt helps me in my recovery but also helps others. I\u2019m very proud to be a part of this movement.\u201d", "images":
