She even received a letter written by former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to the newborn.\n\n\u201cDear Marlow: Happy Birthday!\u201d the note read. \u201cYour birth has been a source of great joy for your parents, Amber and David, and your vast community of admirers and champions. I send my best wishes to you for a lifetime of amazing accomplishments and adventures, full of love, learning, and friendship. With warm regards, I am Sincerely yours, Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, she met up with her Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants costars Blake Lively and Alexis Bledel to celebrate America Ferrera expecting her first child.\n\n\u201cStarting the New Year off with blessings from my Sisterhood. We\u2019ve got work to do for the next generation. Let\u2019s get to it. #TIMESUP,\u201d Ferrera wrote in the caption, referring to the movement in solidarity with women who experienced discrimination, harassment and abuse, which Tamblyn has proudly been an advocate for.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/41w9zguDkO-Pic2HobSzDz1EGKM=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Stephanie-13-258c05f276a7429a88ccccf5dd0c2103.jpg",
