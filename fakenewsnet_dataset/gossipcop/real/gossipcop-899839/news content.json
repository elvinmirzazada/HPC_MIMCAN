Just half an hour ago, James and his wife Jules had a beautiful baby girl.\u201d\n\nStyles told the audience he \u201cwas just at the hospital before I came to fill in and she looks a lot like James \u2014 mainly because James looks like a giant baby.\u201d\n\n.@Harry_Styles is here with a special announcement! \ud83c\udf7c pic.twitter.com/U4GuPltSUA \u2014 \u2603\ufe0f Frosty The Late Late Showman \u2603\ufe0f (@latelateshow) December 13, 2017\n\nWhile he looked at ease in his hosting duties (which included interview guests Owen Wilson, Jane Krakowski and Joel Edgerton), Styles said he was given two hours warning before stepping on the Late Late Show\u2018s stage.\n\n\u201cI was sitting at home two hours ago in this suit, obviously,\u201d he said. \u201cI got the call Jules was going into labor so James naturally called the funniest man he knew\u2026 he obviously wasn\u2019t available.\u201d\n\nStyles and Corden, 39, have frequently collaborated together on the late night show \u2014 including a week-long residency by Styles in May in which he appeared in each episode to perform songs off his self-titled debut album.\n\nToday we welcomed a beautiful baby daughter into the world. Both she and her mother are doing great. We can\u2019t stop smiling. Thank you Harry for stepping in to host the show at 2 and a half hours notice! x x x \u2014 James Corden (@JKCorden) December 13, 2017\n\nThe former One Direction member also addressed his surprising kiss with Corden on Carpool Karaoke which had aired the night before, saying, \u201cI would like to take the opportunity to announce that\u2026 we will also be having a baby!\u201d\n\nCorden announced the birth of his third child with his wife, and not Styles, via Twitter Tuesday.\n\n\u201cToday we welcomed a beautiful baby daughter into the world.
