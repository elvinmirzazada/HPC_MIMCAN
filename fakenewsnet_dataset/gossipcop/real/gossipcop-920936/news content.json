The 33-year-old royal gave a speech at the Veterans\u2019 Mental Health Conference in London on Thursday where he revealed some details about a trip he took with his future bride.\n\n\u201cI have seen those I have served with suffer, struggling to seek out the help they desperately need. And we know there are more just like them who continue to suffer in silence. And when the individual doesn't or can't reach out for help, it is also their families who suffer; especially their spouses and children, who are left feeling desperate and confused as they try to seek appropriate help for the ones they love,\u201d Harry, a veteran himself explained. \u201cSome of the stories Meghan and I heard when we visited Colchester Garrison a few weeks ago shocked us to our core.\u201d\n\nHarry also opened up about the problems facing servicemen and women today, with an emphasis on mental health.\n\n\u201cAnger, isolation, violence, substance misuse, all stem from the same place \u2013 and these are not unique to the military. To truly make a difference to veterans and their families, of course we must help those in need, but we must focus on solving the problem at source,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, this issue is personal. My time in the Army gave me the strongest respect for everyone who wears the uniform. It is a community I am proud to belong to, and I will always seek out anyway that I can to support it.\u201d\n\nThough Harry and Meghan have made many public appearances together since their engagement last fall, they did not publicly visit Colchester Garrison \u2013 a military base in Essex, England. This is the first confirmed report of one of Meghan\u2019s private visits.\n\nLast month the U.K.\u2019s Telegraph reported that the former Suits star had visited victims of London\u2019s Grenfell Tower fire.\n\n\"Meghan has been regularly making private visits to organizations as she gets to know the U.K. charity sector,\" a source told the newspaper at the time.\n\nWith the younger royals focusing on mental health, Meghan has been seamlessly joining in on the public outings. In addition to attending a Commonwealth Day service with Queen Elizabeth this week, Prince Harry\u2019s fianc\u00e9e has also visited Birmingham, Nottingham, Scotland, and Wales.\n\nThe packed schedule has not put a damper on Meghan\u2019s wedding planning as her May 19 nuptials draw nearer.
