And he\u2019s only gotten hotter with age!\n\n\u201cBut in 2018, gathering friends and family, well, it\u2019s not as easy as what it used to be. The country is divided. Sometimes that can make it tough to find common ground, but this year \u2026 this year, I think we should all take a deep breath, find the ability to forgive, and remind ourselves there is no difference so great that we can\u2019t overcome it,\u201d the Gilmore Girls alum, 39, concludes, before scooping chili out of a Crock-Pot into a bowl as the hashtag #CrockPotIsInnocent appears on the screen.\n\nThe promo is in response to the January 23 episode of This Is Us, which ended with Jack walking around the kitchen, tidying up. Before heading to bed, he turns off the family\u2019s Crock-Pot \u2014 but due to its old age and faulty switch, the slow cooker switched back on and started a fire that many believe took the beloved character\u2019s life. Following the episode, upset fans tweeted about Crock-Pots, with many saying they refuse to use the household appliance.\n\nRelated: 8 Heartwarming Quotes From \u2018This Is Us\u2019 This Is Us may make you cry week after week, but overall, it also warms hearts everywhere. From Beth and Randall\u2019s unique connection to Jack and Rebecca\u2019s undying (well, not technically) love for one another, the tenderness between characters comes across loud and clear in the NBC drama.

Let\u2019s not just lump all those lovely hardworking crockpots together.\u201d\n\nCrock-Pot released its own statement a few days later, assuring viewers that the product is safe to use: \u201cCrock-Pot understands the concerns brought up by the recent episode of This Is Us, and we too are heartbroken by the latest development in Jack\u2019s story line. However, it is important that our consumers understand and have confidence that all Crock-Pot slow cookers exceed all internal testing protocols and all applicable industry safety standards and regulations as verified by independent third-party testing labs. For nearly 50 years, with over 100 million Crock-Pots sold, we have never received any consumer complaints similar to the fictional events portrayed in last night\u2019s episode. In fact, the safety and design of our product renders this type of event nearly impossible.\u201d\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
