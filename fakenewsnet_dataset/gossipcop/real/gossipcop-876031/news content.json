Nick's younger brother and fellow 98 Degrees member Drew Lachey won the mirror ball trophy in season two with partner Cheryl Burke and returned to compete in season 15.\n\nEarlier this week, the pros competing this season were revealed, which included fan favorite Mark Ballas' return to the show. He will join Maks, Peta, Val Chmerkovskiy, Emma Slater, Lindsay Arnold, Keo Motsepe, Artem Chigvintsev, Gleb Savchenko, Sharna Burgess, Witney Carson and Alan Bersten, who was promoted from troupe member. A source told ET that Burke will also be returning as a pro. Though, when contacted about news of Burke re-joining DWTS, ABC had no comment.\n\nET also learned a few of the celebrities who will be competing in this season, which includes one Property Brother star Drew Scott. Find out who else will be putting on their dancing shoes in the video below.\n\nDancing With the Stars returns Monday, Sept. 18 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.\n\nReporting by Darla Murray.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_showclip_dwts_082817.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2020-11/mirrorball_trophy_gettyimages-1184740546_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-08%2Fgettyimages-539485168.jpg%3Fh%3Dd98473a2&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fet_markballas_082417.png%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_showclip_dwts_082817.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/nick-and-vanessa-lachey-joining-dancing-stars-season-25-cast-source-says-86088", "title": "Nick and Vanessa Lachey Joining 'Dancing With the Stars' Season 25 Cast, Source Says", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_showclip_dwts_082817.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "A source tells ET that the couple will compete for the mirror ball trophy.", "title": "Nick and Vanessa Lachey Joining 'Dancing With the Stars' Season 25 Cast, Source Says", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/nick-and-vanessa-lachey-joining-dancing-stars-season-25-cast-source-says-86088", "type": "Article"}, "description": "A source tells ET that the couple will compete for the mirror ball trophy.", "twitter": {"description": "A source tells ET that the couple will compete for the mirror ball trophy.", "title": "Nick and Vanessa Lachey Joining 'Dancing With the Stars' Season 25 Cast, Source Says", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/nick-and-vanessa-lachey-joining-dancing-stars-season-25-cast-source-says-86088", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_showclip_dwts_082817.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Nick and Vanessa Lachey Joining 'Dancing With the Stars' Season 25 Cast, Source Says | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, Nick Lachey, Vanessa Lachey, Dancing With The Stars", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 42, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
