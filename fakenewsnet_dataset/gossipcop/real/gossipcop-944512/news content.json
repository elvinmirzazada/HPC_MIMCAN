I really am. So sorry I\u2019m rich, so sorry I\u2019m married to a movie star, so sorry I\u2019m not so bad looking.\u201d\n\nZeta-Jones, 48, has been married to fellow actor Michael Douglas, 71, since 2000. They have two children together \u2014 17-year-old Dylan, who recently celebrated his high school graduation in New York, and Carys, 15.\n\n\u201cNo sorries,\u201d she continued. \u201cEnough. All that is important to me now is my work.\u201d\n\nThe Welsh Oscar-winner opened up about her upbringing as the daughter of a seamstress and factory worker, crediting her upbringing for her drive.\n\n\u201cI come from a working-class family in Wales and I worked to get to where I am,\u201d Zeta-Jones said. \u201cAnd for many years all of us are victims of the fact that we\u2019ve all got so humble.\u201d\n\nZeta-Jones, 48, has been married to fellow actor Michael Douglas, 71, since 2000.\n\nHer career began when she was 9 years old, starring in a touring production of \u201cAnnie.\u201d From there, she went on to land a recurring role in a British TV series, \u201cThe Darling Buds of May,\u201d at 22 \u2013 which launched her into \u201cThe Mask of Zorro,\u201d \u201cEntrapment\u201d and, eventually, \u201cChicago,\u201d for which she won her Best Supporting Actress Oscar.\n\nBut Zeta-Jones admitted that somewhere among the characters she played, her passion for acting wavered.\n\n\u201cWhat shaped me as an actor, more than anything, is getting older,\u201d she said. \u201cI genuinely lost my mojo. I didn\u2019t like it very much anymore. I was on a successful path, there wasn\u2019t any crisis or anything. Somewhere along the middle I got frightened again and I started to \u00adquestion myself as an actor, my choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I matured as a woman, as a mother, as a wife, I\u2019m not scared anymore.\u201d\n\nZeta-Jones recently starred in the TV movie \u201cCocaine Godmother: The Griselda Blanco Story,\u201d a Lifetime feature based on the true story of a Colombian drug lord.

The series \u2013set to debut next year \u2014 will run on Facebook\u2019s new video platform, Facebook Watch.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a great character and I couldn\u2019t let this one go,\u201d Zeta-Jones said of the role. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get my Tulsa, Oklahoma, accent going. I love doing accents. There\u2019s not many Welsh roles around, as you can imagine.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/06/15/6LAXQMCQN5EMFNAE2GXSQ43Q7A.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NYDN-LOGO-WHITE-J.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/06/15/6LAXQMCQN5EMFNAE2GXSQ43Q7A.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariel Scotti"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/06/15/catherine-zeta-jones-is-not-sorry-for-being-pretty-rich-and-married-to-a-movie-star/", "title": "Catherine Zeta-Jones is not sorry for being pretty, rich and married to a movie star", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Catherine Zeta-Jones is over being humble about her enviable life.", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Catherine Zeta-Jones is not sorry for being pretty, rich and married to a movie star", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/06/15/catherine-zeta-jones-is-not-sorry-for-being-pretty-rich-and-married-to-a-movie-star/", "description": "Catherine Zeta-Jones is over being humble about her enviable life. \u201cOne thing I\u2019m not is humble anymore,\u201d Zeta-Jones said in a wide-ranging interview with the Mirror UK. \u201cI&\u2026", "site_name": "New York Daily News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/06/15/6LAXQMCQN5EMFNAE2GXSQ43Q7A.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "width": 1024, "height": 670}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-15T16:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-12-13T12:28:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Catherine Zeta-Jones is not sorry for being pretty, rich and married to a movie star"}, "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/06/15/6LAXQMCQN5EMFNAE2GXSQ43Q7A.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cropped-DailyNewsCamera-7.webp?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529010000.0, "source": "https://www.nydailynews.com", "summary": ""}
