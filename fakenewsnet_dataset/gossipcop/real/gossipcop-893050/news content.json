And it was well worth the wait because the record is good, plain and simple\u2014a delectable collection of techno-heavy bops with poignant, petty, and wildly romantic lyrics. Like all Swift albums, though, fans will most likely care more about the words to these songs than the sonics.\n\nSo that's where we come in: We went ahead and scoured Swift's new album for all the Joe Alwyn, Calvin Harris, Tom Hiddleston, and Kimye references\u2014and there are a ton of 'em. Swift isn't playing games this time around, and we love her for it. Dig in.\n\nJoe Alwyn\n\n\"Delicate\": This song is one of many odes to Alwyn on this album. She references his blue eyes (\"Damn, never seen that color blue\"), the women in England (\"Do the girls back home touch you like I do?\"), and the brevity of their relationship (\"Is it too soon to do this yet?\").\n\n\"Dress\": \"Flashback to when you met me / Your buzz cut / And my hair bleached,\" Swift reveals toward the end of this song. Alwyn had a buzzcut while filming Billy Lynn's Halftime Walk, and Swift had bleached-blond hair for the first half of 2016. The \"gold tattoo\" reference could also be a nod to Alwyn's golden blond hair.\n\n\"Don't Blame Me\": There's no specific references, but this entire song discusses how Swift's \"drug\" is her \"baby,\" so it's obvious who this is about.\n\n\"King of My Heart\": The \"king\" in this song is not American, because Swift says she's his \"American queen.\" She also says this king \"fancies\" her, which is a British term. And we don't have to remind you that Alwyn is British.\n\n\"Gorgeous\": \"Gorgeous\" is perhaps the most obvious tribute to Alwyn on the record. It includes lines explicitly referring to his accent (\"I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk\") and his eyes (\"Ocean blue eyes\").\n\n\"...Ready for It?\": Our money's on this being yet another Alwyn song. The man on this track is \"younger than her exes\" (Alwyn is 26), and she references an \"island.\" (The U.K., where Alwyn lives, is an island.) Also, the concept of \"games\" comes up in this song, which might be a wink to Alwyn's movie Billy Lynn's Halftime Walk.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/64cd37f7f2d4984422dd4ba1/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6557ba3c5248f9740d03ad6a/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/653014bc8a5cb93b92bb5254/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6550e82cb69978c2ccb81db6/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/654d40a1d067bc4e09d989dd/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6564d2808e843e41a3d82eeb/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a04bbe9b0ba91733b05d034/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/reputation.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/65159927af8cae32202cbfc6/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a04bbe9b0ba91733b05d034/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/reputation.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a04bbe9b0ba91733b05d034/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/reputation.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christopher Rosa"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-reputation-kimye-joe-alwyn-calvin-harris-tom-hiddleston-references", "title": "Taylor Swift's 'Reputation': All the Kimye, Joe Alwyn, Calvin Harris, and Tom Hiddleston References", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Taylor Swift's sixth studio album, 'Reputation,' finally dropped last night.
