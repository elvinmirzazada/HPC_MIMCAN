From the inseparable Big Little Lies ladies to the stunning This is Us cast, we caught every moment not shown on TV.\n\nHere are the best backstage moments you didn\u2019t see.\n\nOn the Red Carpet\n\nNewlywed Julianne Hough kicked things off on the 2017 red carpet. The Dancing with the Stars judge quickly made her way down the carpet as she posed, rocking a baby-oiled ponytail.\n\nThis Is Us nominee Sterling K. Brown and his wife Ryan Michelle Bathe joined Hough in the early-bird arrivals. The actor gave his wife a sweet kiss on the cheek as they waited to talk to press on the carpet. His wife gushed over her dress, saying she\u2019s been FaceTiming with her stylist all morning. Brown adorably carried his wife\u2019s train as they walked the carpet.\n\nJohn Shearer/WireImage\n\nWatch the full episode of People & Entertainment Weekly Red Carpet Live, streaming now on PeopleTV.

Kidman also took the time to snuggle up with hubby Keith Urban while taking pictures.\n\nMatt Baron/Shutterstock\n\nProud dad Liev Schreiber (and Ray Donovan nominee) walked the carpet with his adorable 8-year-old son Kai and protectively stroked his hair throughout the night.\n\nThe actor gave a sweet shoutout on Instagram to his youngest son, who he shares with ex-partner Naomi Watts. \u201cThe very dapper and downright divine Kai Schreiber!!!\u201d Schreiber wrote.\n\nDan Steinberg/Invision/AP\n\nInside the Show\n\nThe show kicked off with a couple of sweet moments as late night hosts James Corden and Jimmy Kimmel led their respective wives to their seats hand-in-hand.\n\nThe audience got a hilarious surprise as former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer came out with a makeshift podium. The celeb-filled crowd was as shocked as they were amused to see the embattled Spicer onstage.\n\nCBS\n\nVeep\u2018s Anna Chlumsky reacting to Sean Spicer\n\nLater in the show, surprise supporting actress winner Ann Dowd was so stunned by her win for The Handmaid\u2019s Tale that, as she staggered down the aisle, Leslie Jones reassured her, \u201cYes! It\u2019s you! You won!\u201d\n\nSterling K. Brown was a popular winner for This Is Us and had the crowd behind him as the Emmy producers cut off his mic and dimmed the lights in an attempt to end his speech for outstanding lead actor in a drama.\n\nBackstage\n\nWhile the show was happening live, the backstage area was abuzz with several big stars coming in and out.\n\nProud boyfriend Ben Affleck was seen standing close to his Saturday Night Live producer girlfriend Lindsay Shookus as they watched the show from a monitor.

Reese Witherspoon celebrated with husband Jim Toth and daughter Ava, 18, although the show\u2019s star and producer told PEOPLE she didn\u2019t need the outstanding limited series Emmy to feel like she\u2019d won. \u201cI set out four years ago to create better roles for women in film and television.
