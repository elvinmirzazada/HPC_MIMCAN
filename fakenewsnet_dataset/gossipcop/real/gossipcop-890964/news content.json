I was just like, 'It\u2019s so amazing to be from a country where we have so many top models and we are proud of what we do.' When you\u2019re from the same country, you\u2019re cheering for [each other]. That was my first and favorite\u2014until now.\u201d\n\nWhen she hits the catwalk in Shanghai, all Ribeiro hopes for is that the image of her in the \"Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra\" feels true to her. \u201cI hope I can show my personality\u2026. I try to be calm and do me,\" she says. That's not as easy as it sounds when you're on that mega-runway in your lingerie, with heavy wings flapping behind you, Ribeiro assures: \"You\u2019re walking and you feel like you\u2019re bouncing\"\u2014but at the same time you're trying to have that not read on your face because you know you have cameras pointed at you from every angle. Looking for familiar faces in the audience doesn't help calm her nerves, either. \"When I [see] them, I just want to cry. It\u2019s kind of like, \u2018OK, they\u2019re there, they\u2019re proud of me, but I can\u2019t control my emotions,\u2019 because I\u2019m very emotional,\" she admits. When the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show went to London, she actually couldn't keep it together: \"I saw my sister, and I just started to cry and everyone was like, \u2018What is happening?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know!\u2019\"\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe \"Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra\" will have its moment to shine on the 2017 Victoria's Secret runway later this month, but Ribeiro has gotten a few chances to try the style on for size since she got the news. So the million-dollar\u2014or rather, two-million-dollar question is: What does the Fantasy Bra feel like? According to Ribeiro, \"It feels amazing, I have to say\u2014it feels very powerful. I was just feeling myself when I was wearing it.\"\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nAnd the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Fantasy Bra Goes To\u2026\n\nThe Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Finally Cast Its Models!
