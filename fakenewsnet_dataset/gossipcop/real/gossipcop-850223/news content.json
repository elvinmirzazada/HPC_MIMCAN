Middleton effectively became a trendsetter overnight.\n\nBut the royal reverberations continue far beyond the months surrounding the nuptials.\n\nIn 2015, the Kate Effect brought more than $205 million (\u00a3152 million) to the British economy, while the \"Charlotte Effect\" and the \"George Effect\" translated to over $239 million (\u00a3177 million) combined, Brand Finance estimates.\n\nMarkle wore this Diane von Furstenberg dress to a charity gala five years before Middleton wore it.

Brown/Getty Images\n\nBut Markle, a fixture on red carpets in the US and recently described as \"a singular mover of product\" by The New York Times, could have even wider influence and fiscal effect than her future sister-in-law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 36-year-old actress led a surprisingly relatable life \u2014 which included sharing photos of her friends and family, clothes, and travels on her now deleted Instagram and blog \u2014 before recently rocketing to global fame. And Markle's American citizenship, along with the few years she spent living in Canada while shooting television drama \"Suits,\" could expand her global fan base. Her style is also decidedly trendier and less traditional than Middleton's.\n\nAfter Markle and Prince Harry's engagement was announced, the couple posed for photos at Kensington Palace in London. She wore a coat by the Canadian fashion brand Line, a brand beloved by Canadians, but fairly obscure outside the country. Soon after the brand was identified, its site slowed or crashed for many visitors.\n\nAll things considered, 2018 is set to be a banner year for the British royal family as they're expected to drum up more than $3.8 billion (\u00a32.8 billion) for the country's economy, according to Brand Finance.\n\nMore on the royal wedding:", "images":
