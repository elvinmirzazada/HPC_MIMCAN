Subscribe now for the exclusive interview, only in PEOPLE!\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy fans may still be mourning the loss of their beloved Dr. Derek \u201cMcDreamy\u201d Shepherd after he was killed off last April, but Patrick Dempsey, the actor who played him for 11 seasons, was ready to move on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very grateful for Grey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d Dempsey tells PEOPLE exclusively in this week\u2019s issue. \u201cIt\u2019s given me the opportunity to do everything. But at the same time, there was a cost.\u201d\n\nIndeed, long hours and an enormous time commitment began to take a toll on the 50-year-old actor, who also struggled spending so much time away from his wife Jillian and their three children: Talula, 14, and 8-year-old twin boys, Darby and Sullivan.\n\n\u201cI think after a certain period of time, no matter how much money you make, you want control out of your own schedule,\u201d says Dempsey, who stars in Bridget Jones\u2019s Baby, out Sept. 16.\n\n\u201cIt had been long enough. It was time for me to move on with other things and other interests. I probably should have moved on a couple of years earlier. I stayed a bit longer than I should have.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Patrick Dempsey on Saving His Marriage with Jillian: \u2018I Wasn\u2019t Prepared to Give up on Her\u2019\n\nAnd Dempsey says that when it came to discussions with show creator, Shonda Rhimes, \u201cit was clear we were both ready. But we kept it very quiet.\u201d With no table reads, the actor says no one knew how his character would perish. \u201cI knew he was going to be gone, but I didn\u2019t know how she was going to handle it. Shonda just said, I\u2019m going to do it in a really good way and she did her thing.\u201d\n\nIn the end, \u201cI thought it was really interesting,\u201d says Dempsey of McDreamy\u2019s death. \u201cIt definitely woke people up. And it was beautifully symbolic in many ways.\u201d\n\n\u2022 For exclusive photos and much more from Patrick Dempsey, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday\n\nNow, the actor is focused on more roles, producing and his work with the Dempsey Center, dedicated to helping patients with cancer and founded in honor of his late mother.\n\nAnd of course, family. On a ski trip last winter, \u201cI was so happy to be riding a chair life in a snowstorm with my kids,\u201d says Dempsey. \u201cI was really grateful to have the time to just sit down and enjoy stuff like that. I\u2019m definitely more relaxed now. And happier too.\u201d\n\nBridget Jones\u2019s Baby hits theaters Sept. 16.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/cwpZIXUFyx4dVQnTIjD563cXGO0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Greys-Anatomy-Recap-2022102895-e2c04efd604f4dc7aaa57534086f0584.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/pt5G1D9tEGD1oOcF3Z8WhK3EEH4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1059x505:1061x507)/kelly-mccreary-exiting-greys-anatomy-031723-1-caeebf1a16d94ccb9fb9166af2fb6f75.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/_VgqLfsIg3xJEbuJxwCcCxLoBlA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/dempsey-2000-0268783f54874a3c94adfe9a1e41cfa7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/s4gSK_4OuwxpalUq0A_CQu3scF8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/greys-anatomy-2022121655-050050bbd3c34e88921ddc4d6d1cc3b6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/r1F3NPSk6LQFJYJQMxMwP124yfA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x492:1001x494)/sweet-home-alabama-74011fa8008940fc938a3a38002e1a09.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/cExbjpiQDyqaqzLdV539oG4AvHc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1079x524:1081x526)/patrick-jillian-dempsey-tout-9b2bbc69ae3f49e4b0b53c4df02c3a52.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/agZaGo2u5Yg3UNxBudB2vAqIRVo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(511x0:513x2)/patrick-dempsey-2-800-aaab8e293dc64605a54e5245077c202a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KIXhw2LGbcycSLDqKnRiikqUR80=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(779x309:781x311)/Greys-anatomy-2004-Ellen-Pompeo-Patrick-Dempsey-01-102522-a23fdf030b554e968a1304131d137614.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3EJCiuJhO0mM73W9IOBjeJVPDmk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kelly-mccreary-paleyfest-la-2023-greys-anatomy-040323-1-5147345b24974137a87c6423443ce2e0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/sJurlSBtXu3tiWobOWYHAn_EkF4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x189:736x191)/Greys-Anatomy-Recap-01-101322-752964d88fb94f07abd514084614f9f5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/IVVWayjYs0t6A3-7Mh-Y3OFiqVA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Greys-Anatomy-Recap30-26062022-3fb52d0b3bcb42bfbdc06fa48fefb292.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-h9VDGq-hQdmR2jNPbWPZBpZgSQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/disenchanted-111822-5f466f49359c47fbae97bf6db6a4cc5d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/xzMIgVp0BB_MCqToeq2_3AhJbqw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x238:721x240)/patrick-dempsey-moms-legacy-042723-tout-9d79fe0e36584daba72e44d5aa131667.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/CO9dB8rcLlXe_bxCMbYgql9NBoc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(329x369:331x371)/patrick-dempsey-ellen-pompeo-092122-5fc0fce685644905aebe8812043a1937.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/dlSjY_hdB2aoBKhuHKQNb59rX2M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/ellen-pompeo-1A-5bff73e528a94d469fc774f97314e2eb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/f_4c7kRn7CvkbBiZ_E_7c2xG25I=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(899x862:901x864)/ellen-pompeo-chris-ivery-7-57f8bc7bf7a64f9bb4006a3faae8190f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1lf_sFjm4EZ4pTU2ewAl11_i5tE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x554:1001x556)/patrick-dempsey-kids-1-595d5c0bd0d8453cb5a67d56432dad51.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/agZaGo2u5Yg3UNxBudB2vAqIRVo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(511x0:513x2)/patrick-dempsey-2-800-aaab8e293dc64605a54e5245077c202a.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aili Nahas", "Aili Nahas Is The Former West Coast Deputy News Director At People.
