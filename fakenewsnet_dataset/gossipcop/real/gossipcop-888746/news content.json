Over the weekend, the New York Times published a report revealing that O'Reilly had settled with an accuser for an astonishing $32 million shortly before the upstanding citizens at Fox News signed him to a $100 million contract extension in February\u2014a decision, one would presume, that it came to regret a few months later.\n\nO'Reilly, as usual, remains very, very mad about all of this. He continues to assert that no women complained about him during the entirety of his twenty-year tenure, and he punctuated his interview with the Times with things like \"This is horrible!\" and \"This is crap!\" and other normal things that well-balanced people say when they definitely didn't do the horrible things they've been accused of doing. On Monday, Megyn Kelly, a former O'Reilly colleague who left in January for NBC, went on the air to dispute his claims, reading from evidence obtained from a source she knows well: herself.", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/656267c718f99454105f6908/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/coupons/static/shop/47058/logo/peacock-tv-coupon.png", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6560fc35cef9f2854e46452f/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://www.gq.com/coupons/static/shop/38333/logo/Asos_trans_back.png", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6542ae62f1b58bff75de21ac/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/655a7914df4b07be448d520d/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/coupons/static/shop/39688/logo/Wayfair_Logo-GQ__1_.png", "https://www.gq.com/coupons/static/shop/46737/logo/Samsung-discount-code.png", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6542c0de35641b29f8db9378/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6556924af5cbf47e8834fed0/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e5236b6d413fa363728/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-862911956.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/65565bfbf5cbf47e8834fe1e/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png", "https://www.gq.com/coupons/static/shop/38348/logo/michaels-coupon-logo.png", "https://www.gq.com/coupons/static/shop/45452/logo/shein-coupon-code.png", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Jay Willis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/megyn-kelly-bill-oreilly-the-receipts", "title": "Megyn Kelly Shares Her Complaints About Bill O'Reilly That Fox News Allegedly Ignored", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Megyn Kelly shared old complaints about Bill O'Reilly that she had sent to superiors at Fox News, who then allegedly ignored her.", "id": "59ee46a924789d7510df1e52", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59ee46a924789d7510df1e52", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Megyn Kelly shared old complaints about Bill O'Reilly that she had sent to superiors at Fox News, who then allegedly ignored her.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png\"}", "og": {"description": "She read from her old complaints about Bill O'Reilly on the air.", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png", "site_name": "GQ", "title": "Megyn Kelly Offers Rare Look Into How Fox News Silences Alleged Victims of Sexual Harassment", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gq.com/story/megyn-kelly-bill-oreilly-the-receipts"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-10-23T21:39:46.938Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-23T21:39:46.938Z", "author": "Jay Willis"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@gqmagazine", "description": "She read from her old complaints about Bill O'Reilly on the air.", "domain": "https://www.gq.com", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@gqmagazine", "title": "Megyn Kelly Offers Rare Look Into How Fox News Silences Alleged Victims of Sexual Harassment"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vGGEefKbc4k"], "publish_date": 1508794786.938, "source": "https://www.gq.com", "summary": ""}
