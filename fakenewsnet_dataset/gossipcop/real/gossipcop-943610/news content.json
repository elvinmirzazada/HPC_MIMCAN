Figure skater and America's sweetheart Adam Rippon also attended the gala with his boyfriend, Jussi-Pekka Kajaala, making it their big official red carpet debut.\n\nGetty Images\n\nKajaala is from Finland and is a real estate broker and is just an extremely attractive human being, really.\n\n\n\nThe two started talking in October after Kajaala slid into Rippon's Tinder DM's with a smooth pickup line. Kajaala asked Rippon, \"Are you here for business or are you here just to meet me?\" Clearly it worked because the two have been dating for a few months now.\n\nThis is their first red carpet appearance together, but Kajaala has graced Rippon's Instagram feed multiple times. Here they are cruising through the ocean:\n\nBeing fit:\n\nJust being cute:\n\nAnd celebrating Pride:\n\nAnd while their red carpet debut was so cute, Rippon was focused on making sure people are aware of the Trevor Project's life-saving resources.\n\n\"I think now we should have a serious talk about mental health and suicide prevention,\" Rippon told E! News. \"I think it's important to remember that the Trevor hotline is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to anyone. Whether you know someone going through something or you're going through something yourself, it's open and available.\"\n\n\n\nThe Trevor Lifeline is open 24/7 at (866) 488-7386.", "images":
