Jack Curry, Steph announced Wednesday on Instagram alongside a photo of their newborn.\n\n\u201cOn this journey, on this quest \u2026 protect me \u2026I\u2019m bless!\u201d the basketball superstar captioned the snapshot before revealing his baby boy\u2019s name.\n\nAyesha, 29, and Steph, 30, are also parents to two daughters: Ryan Carson, 3 on Tuesday, and Riley, who turns 6 on July 19.\n\n\u201cMy heart is FULL. God has been too good to us,\u201d Ayesha captioned a black-and-white photo of Canon with his big sisters.\n\n\u201cOur beautiful baby boy Canon W.Jack Curry 7/2/2018. He joined us earlier than we thought and we couldn\u2019t be more excited and grateful. Family of 5!\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Curry party of 5,\u201d Ayesha captioned the photo, adding, \u201cFeeling very blessed \u2026 and very sick. Yippie! #curryfor3\ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd30\ud83c\udffd\u201d\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer/Getty\n\nPrior to the announcement of their baby\u2019s birth, the couple did not reveal the sex. In February, Steph told Ellen DeGeneres that he was the one pressuring his wife not to find out what they were having \u2014 even though the results were on her phone.\n\n\u201cI would love to get to the delivery room and have that surprise. I\u2019ve heard stories on both ends of finding out early, finding out when the baby was born. But she\u2019s a planner, she wants to know,\u201d he said.\n\nAyesha Curry/Instagram\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ayesha Curry Is Feeling \u201cAwful\u201d Four and a Half Months Into Her Third Pregnancy\n\n\n\nThat same month, Ayesha revealed her prenatal journey had not been an easy one thus far.\n\n\u201cI still have nausea, can\u2019t sleep, pee every five seconds and am just so darn tired. I have what docs call Hyperemesis. This basically means the nausea, incessant sickness and exhaustion probably won\u2019t go away,\u201d she blogged on her co-founded lifestyle community goInspo.\n\n\u201cThe only silver linings here are that my itty-bitty baby is healthy and Princess Kate has suffered from the same condition during her pregnancies. Not feeling super royal though,\u201d she added.\n\nAnd there could be more Curry kids in their future. \u201c[Steph would] have three more kids right now if he could,\u201d Ayesha, who released a cookbook that fall, said in the June 2016 issue of Parents magazine.", "images":
