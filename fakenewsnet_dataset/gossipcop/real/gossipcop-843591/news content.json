A segment on a Dutch game show called Neem Je Zwemspullen Mee (Bring Your Bathing Suit) asks male contestants to guess whether women are fat or pregnant, and the internet is none too pleased about the misogynistic premise.\n\nRelated: Biggest Magazine Cover Controversies Ever From Mindy Kaling's 2013 Elle \"Women in TV\" cover controversy to Gisele Bundchen and LeBron James' \"racially insensitive\" Vogue cover from 2008, see the most talked-about, controversial magazine covers of all time.\n\nThe shocking episode aired in the Netherlands on Sunday, April 9, and, already, many are petitioning to have the show taken off the air for good. This isn\u2019t the first time the series has stirred up controversy. Last year, Bring Your Bathing Suit made headlines when contestants were asked to guess whether a person was Japanese or Chinese, and if a woman\u2019s breasts were real.\n\nRelated: Celebs Fight Back on Twitter!

In this round we feature lots of prejudices based on what people look like,\u201d show director Yvonne de Haan said in a statement. \u201cIs he a criminal or a business man?, or is he Dutch or German? Putting things in a satirical setting is a way of laughing at prejudice. But we did it in a way that hurt people.
