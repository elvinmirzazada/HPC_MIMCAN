The last-night talk show host appeared on the show with a cast on his hand, explaining that he suffered the severe finger injury in a fall.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Reid-Nakamura.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Tyler-Cameron-Nick-Viall.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Reid-Nakamura.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/evan-ellingson-getty.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/LiC-Brie-Aja-Ending.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Michael-Strahan-Oscars-2015.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Michael-Strahan-Oscars-2015.jpg?fit=618%2C411&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/the-masked-singer-cow.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Michael-Strahan-Oscars-2015.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reid Nakamura", "Andi Ortiz", "Loree Seitz", "Dessi Gomez", "Tv Reporter", "Reid.Nakamura Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/wonder-why-michael-strahan-wasnt-on-gma-yesterday-he-lost-a-little-bit-of-his-pinky/", "title": "Michael Strahan Missed \u2018GMA\u2019 Because He \u2018Lost a Little Bit\u2019 of His Pinky", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Michael Strahan Missed 'GMA' Because He 'Lost a Little Bit' of His Pinky - TheWrap", "description": "\"Good Morning America\" host returned to the show Wednesday", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/wonder-why-michael-strahan-wasnt-on-gma-yesterday-he-lost-a-little-bit-of-his-pinky/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Michael-Strahan-Oscars-2015.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 411, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-08-02T17:47:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-02T17:56:35+00:00"}, "author": "Reid Nakamura", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Reid Nakamura", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Michael Strahan Missed \u2018GMA\u2019 Because He \u2018Lost a Little Bit\u2019 of His Pinky", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/wonder-why-michael-strahan-wasnt-on-gma-yesterday-he-lost-a-little-bit-of-his-pinky/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-08-02T10:47:37-07:00", "parsely-section": "news", "parsely-author": "Reid Nakamura", "parsely-tags": "good_morning_america, michael_strahan", "article-tags": "good_morning_america, michael_strahan}", "article-section": "news", "article-categories": "media, news, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501696057.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
