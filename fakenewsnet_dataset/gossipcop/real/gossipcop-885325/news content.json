AOL announced the shutdown today, acknowledging that people now communicate in new ways online, so AIM is no longer needed.\n\n\u201cAIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed,\u201d writes Michael Albers, communications products VP at Oath (the Verizon behemoth that consumed AOL).\n\nTime to set your final away message\n\nAOL cut off access to AIM from third-party chat clients back in March, hinting at this eventual shutdown. It\u2019s hard to imagine that many people are still using AIM, so that change, nor this upcoming shutdown, are likely to make a huge difference.\n\nAIM was one of the first and most successful instant messengers, widely used in the late \u201890s and even throughout the 2000s. I was still using AIM to chat with my friends throughout college at the end of the decade, including to stay in touch with my (not-yet) significant other while she was studying abroad.\n\nBut with the proliferation of smartphones, everything has changed. Text messaging has taken over for desktop instant messaging apps, and increasingly, we\u2019re seeing other social apps, like Snapchat and Instagram, take over for those in certain ways. For straight messaging, Facebook also makes things much easier, since you\u2019re already connected to everyone you know and can just start up a chat without exchanging arcane things like screen names. In fact, Facebook has multiple billion-user messaging services at this point, Messenger and WhatsApp.\n\nOther classic chat apps have shut down in recent years, too. MSN Messenger shut down in 2014, and Yahoo Messenger shut down last year (although Yahoo also launched a new messaging service under the same name). It was only a matter of time until AIM joined them, but there\u2019s still some nostalgia in seeing it go.", "images": ["https://www.theverge.com/icons/native-ad-placeholder.png", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2950x1962/2400x2400/filters:focal(1241x557:1242x558):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25015564/BYSO_S1_UT_102_220503_PALBRO_00043RC_f_3000.jpeg", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:500x281/2400x1602/filters:focal(250x141:251x142):no_upscale():format(webp)/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9405813/tumblr_inline_oxdk1eOA0g1v9fx0s_500.gif", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3600x2397/2400x2400/filters:focal(1800x1199:1801x1200):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25016291/1175377257.jpg", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4236x2824/2400x2400/filters:focal(2118x1412:2119x1413):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25014894/Image.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rgpugn5gf41iJA5RTjdDLZmGDU8=/0x0:998x560/1200x628/filters:focal(499x280:500x281)/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9405823/Screen_Shot_2017_10_06_at_10.06.22_AM.png", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x2400/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23318439/akrales_220309_4977_0324.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rgpugn5gf41iJA5RTjdDLZmGDU8=/0x0:998x560/1200x628/filters:focal(499x280:500x281)/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9405823/Screen_Shot_2017_10_06_at_10.06.22_AM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacob Kastrenakes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/6/16435690/aim-shutting-down-after-20-years-aol-instant-messenger", "title": "AIM will shut down after 20 years", "meta_data": {"description": "The Verge is about technology and how it makes us feel.
