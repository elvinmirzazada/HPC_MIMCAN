More than ever before, the sound of the Latin GRAMMYs are truly international, embraced by fans all over the world. At a time of unprecedented global turmoil and collective anxiety, the songs of Bad Bunny, Shakira, Peso Pluma and Rosal\u00eda \u2014 to name a few of many reigning stars \u2014 have enough zest, honesty and passion in them to provide comfort. Both Spain and Latin America boast a long standing tradition of healing through rhythm and melody. Not surprisingly, this year's ceremony felt like a casual gathering of friends for an evening of dancing and celebrating. From the strains of flamenco to the boom of Mexican music and the ongoing permutations of reggaet\u00f3n, these are the takeaway points from the unforgettable 2023 Latin GRAMMYs. The Genius Of Rosal\u00eda Transcends Her Own Songbook\n\nIt was only fitting that Rosal\u00eda \u2014 one of the most visionary singer/songwriters in global pop \u2014 should open up the first Latin GRAMMY ceremony in Spanish territory. She could have certainly taken advantage of the opportunity to drop a new single or perform one of her many hits. Instead, Rosal\u00eda sang an achingly beautiful version of the 1985 classic \"Se Nos Rompi\u00f3 El Amor\" by the late singer Roc\u00edo Jurado. It was a lovely way to deflect the spotlight and focus on celebrating her Spanish roots. Spain And Latin America Make Beautiful Music Together\n\nFrom beginning to end, the telecast underscored the organic kinship that unites the music of Spain and Latin America. It took place during the International Day of Flamenco, and the transcendent genre was present in Alejandro Sanz's moving performance of \"Coraz\u00f3n Part\u00edo.\" The award for Best Flamenco Album, won by Ni\u00f1a Pastori for Camino, was presented during the main ceremony \u2014 a GRAMMY first. Later in the telecast, Spanish pop singer Manuel Carrasco and Colombian artist Camilo performed an acoustic duet of \"Salitre.\" They were soon joined by Brazilian singer IZA Texas-born producer/songwriter Edgar Barrera, transforming the Sevilla stage with Carnivalesque energy. Hell Hath No Fury Like A Pop Star Scorned\n\nSince its release in January, \u201cShakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53,\u201d the collaboration between Shakira and Argentine producer Bizarrap, has become a global cultural phenomenon. Not only is it a grand pop song with slick EDM accents, but the Colombian diva's lyrics struck a chord with its message of empowerment and fortitude in the face of adversity. The duo's brisk performance \u2014 preceded by a brief intro with Shaki showcasing her tango dancing skills \u2014 was an iconic pop culture moment. The track itself won awards in the Best Pop Song and Song Of The Year categories. Emerging Talent Is The Lifeline That Keeps Latin Music Alive\n\nWatching young artists performing together with the legends that inspired them is a Latin GRAMMY staple. This year was particularly poignant, as Colombian singer/songwriter Juanes performed a moving rendition of the atmospheric rocker \"Gris\" \u2014 about overcoming a relationship crisis \u2014 with majestic background vocals provided by six of the 10 Best New Artist nominees: Borja, Natascha Falc\u00e3o, GALE, Paola Guanche, Le\u00f3n Leiden and Joaquina \u2014 who ended up winning the award. For Mexico, The Time Is Now\n\nThe moment was ripe for the richness and depth of m\u00fasica Mexicana to shine on an international scale. 2023 was the year when the entire world fell in love with the strains of banda, norte\u00f1o and corridos tumbados. The infectious collaboration between Peso Pluma and Eslab\u00f3n Armado, \"Ella Baila Sola\" became the emblem of this revoluci\u00f3n mexicana. A buoyant rendition of the track was a telecast highlight, as well as the performance by Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n, who won the award for Best Norte\u00f1o Album. Laura Pausini's Artistry Evokes The Elegance Of Decades Past\n\nIntroducing herself as \"the most [expletive] Latina Italian woman in the world,\" Laura Pausini seemed overjoyed with her Person Of The Year award. Her medley of career highlights \u2014 full of drama and gorgeous melodies \u2014 included nods to her first mega-hit, the nostalgic \"La Solitudine,\" and the cinematic \"V\u00edveme.\" \"I thank my father because he chose not to go to the movies with my mom, and instead stayed at home, made love to her and had me, the Person Of The Year,\" Pausini quipped. Her songbook evokes the golden era of Latin pop, a time of elegance and style. Radical Genre Bending Never Fails To Intrigue\n\nLatin music is currently experiencing a moment of grace, and this creative apex is frequently expressed through intriguing fusions of seemingly disparate styles. The adrenaline-fueled performance by Puerto Rican neo-reggaet\u00f3n star Rauw Alejandro gained in electricity when he was joined by Juanes on a rocked-up rendition of \"BABY HELLO.\" Elsewhere, Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n's duet with Maluma and Bizarrap's foray into electro-tango were fueled by a similar spirit of playful experimentation. Exquisite Singing & Songwriting Will Never Go Out Of Style\n\nThere's something to be said about an album that was recorded live on tape with analog equipment \u2014 the singer surrounded by her band, as they perform together in the same space, with no outside guests allowed. Natalia Lafourcade's \"De Todas Las Flores\" is all about feeling and warmth, her vulnerable vocals framed by delicate piano notes and supple percussion. A worthy Record Of The Year winner, this exquisitely layered track proposes that some traditional methods of music making are definitely worth preserving. At the Premiere Ceremony, Lafourcade also took home golden gramophones for Best Singer-Songwriter Song and Best Singer-Songwriter Album. Hip-Hop Is A Natural Component Of The Latin Music DNA\n\nAt the tail end of the ceremony, the performance by Colombian vocalist Feid \u2014 aided by the stellar skills of producer DJ Premier \u2014 included a moody reading of \"Le Pido a DIOS\" with nods to '90s rap and jazzy keyboard flourishes. Just like EDM, hip-hop has been fully incorporated into the Latin music lexicon, assuming an identity of its own.
