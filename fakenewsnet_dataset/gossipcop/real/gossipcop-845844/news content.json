Mosher.\n\nBuchanan County Sheriff's Dept.\n\nSoules, 36, was arrested on April 25, 2017, in Iowa after he allegedly crashed his truck into a tractor, running it off the road into a ditch. His vehicle was later found at a home that he was present at, and Soules allegedly refused to leave until officers obtained a search warrant several hours later.\n\nIowa State Patrol alleged that he fled the scene, violating the Iowa code that states: \u201cIf the accident causes the death of a person, all surviving drivers shall remain at the scene of the accident except to seek necessary aid or to report the accident to law enforcement authorities.\u201d\n\nAfter entering a not guilty plea in May to the charge, Soules\u2019 legal team filed a motion to dismiss the \u201cfailure to remain\u201d charge on constitutional grounds, refuting the last sentence of the Iowa state code.\n\nKWWL News 7\n\nThe attorneys said in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that \u201cbecause Mr. Soules indisputably stopped his vehicle, returned to the injured driver, contacted law enforcement, provided aid to the injured driver, arranged for medical treatment for the injured driver, remained until emergency personnel responded to the injured party, and provided identification data, the State\u2019s charge must be dismissed.\u201d\n\nTheir request to dismiss was denied in January before being brought to the Iowa Supreme Court.\n\nLeaving the scene of a fatal car crash is a class D felony in Iowa. If convicted, Soules could face as many as five years in prison.\n\nSoules was not charged with driving under the influence, though court documents obtained by PEOPLE reveal Soules was in possession of alcoholic beverages/containers.\n\nIn June, Soules\u2019 legal team filed court documents, which were obtained by PEOPLE, that stated the former Bachelor did not have alcohol or drugs in his system following the fatal crash.\n\n\u201cA report issued by the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigation\u2019s (DCI) Criminalistics Laboratory, Mr. Soules\u2019 specimens were negative for drugs and alcohol,\u201d his legal team said in the documents.\n\n\u201cThe DCI conducted thorough toxicology testing on two separate samples \u2013 his urine and blood \u2013 and conclusively determined no detectable amounts of alcohol or drugs were in either specimen,\u201d they continued. \u201cFurthermore, Mr. Soules has not been charged with any alcohol related offense. Rather, Mr. Soules has been charged with leaving the scene of a fatal accident.\u201d\n\nAccording to the documents, Soules\u2019 legal team also claims that the following are \u201cnot admissible\u201d and has filed a motion that they not be used in reference to the case or presented to a jury: \u201cAny evidence, testimony, reference, or argument that, on the night in question, Mr. Soules: 1) purchased alcohol, 2) consumed alcohol, 2) drove while impaired, or 3) had beer cans in or around his vehicle.\u201d", "images":
