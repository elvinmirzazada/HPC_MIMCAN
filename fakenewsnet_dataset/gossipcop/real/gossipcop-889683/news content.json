Not only did she turn him down, but she never told anyone until much, much later.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he proposed and you never told us, and I asked him months later,\u201d Kim pointedly explained, as she recalled the NBA player telling her, \"Oh, I did it months ago. She didn\u2019t tell you guys?\"\n\nIf you've been tracking with Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan's timeline for a while now, you might have connected the dots and realized that his pregnancy scandal with Maralee Nichols happened around the exact same time as his secret proposal to Khlo\u00e9. And if you're wondering why Tristan was rejected, it was because Khlo\u00e9 didn't feel \"proud\" to be receiving his offer.\n\n\u201cI need to make sure this is a totally different relationship because I want to be proud to say I\u2019m engaged to anyone and that\u2019s why I said I\u2019m not comfortable accepting this right now because I\u2019m not excited to tell my family,\" she confessed. \u201cAs hurtful as that probably was for him to hear it was the truth.

I think it's really f--ked up that he knew he had another baby on the way with somebody else, which makes me uncomfortable to put someone in that position, especially when there's a child involved.\"\n\nShe added, \"This was just really unforgivable in my books.\"\n\nThe drama did have a happy ending, with the new mom of two FaceTiming friends and family from the hospital following her son's birth. \"Ever since December, it's been this dark cloud looming over me. Every single day, I've been feeling depressed and sad, and now that my son is here, I get to move on, and I get to enjoy. It's almost like I get to close that chapter and be done with this trauma and put it behind me,\" she said.\n\n\"Now I finally get to start the healing process. Now I get to start enjoying my life with two kids in it and figuring this out. This is gonna be day one, and this is gonna be the start of something positive, and happy and beautiful.\"\n\nHULU\n\nSeptember 11, 2022: Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan Risk a Run-In at Beyonce\u0301's Birthday Party\n\nAwk!

Tristan denied having sex with Maralee in California at that time, but he reportedly confirmed that the \"only\" possible date of conception for Maralee's child is March 13, 2021, which is his birthday. Per the docs, Maralee claims the child was conceived in April.\n\nAccording to the docs, Tristan said, \"We did not have any dates in the traditional sense at any time; there were no dining at restaurants, going to movies, traveling or any other indicia of a normalized relationship.\"\n\nHe later admitted that he and Maralee would discuss \"where\" and \"what time\" they would hook up on Snapchat, but denied sending the viral screenshots of a conversation where he was accused of saying that he would be unable to pay an extreme amount of child support because he'd be retiring from the NBA soon.\n\n\n\nDecember 10, 2021: Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are officially over\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson are reportedly \"focused on co-parenting True\" amid reports that the NBA star welcomed his third child with another woman. According to People, \"Khlo\u00e9 is moving on.\" The former couple has allegedly been \"broken up for a while and things are okay between them.\"\n\nThe source said that Khloe remained in a relationship with Tristan \"because she always believed he would change,\" especially since they spent the COVID-19 lockdown together. together.\n\nDetails about Tristan's ongoing paternity lawsuit with Maralee Nichols have been sealed. According to PageSix, the filing no longer be found online. The records are reportedly listed as \"currently confidential or this case has been sealed.\" The findings come days after Tristan reportedly filed a gag order to stop Maralee from engaging with the media about their case.\n\nDecember 2, 2021: Khlo\u00e9 makes a cryptic post after Tristan is accused of fathering a child while they were together\n\nKhlo\u00e9 took to her Instagram Story amid reports that Tristan Thompson was allegedly expecting his third child with Maralee Nichols. According to screenshots obtained by Life and Style, the reality star reposted a quote from Girl Unfiltered that read, \"I just don't have time for negative energy, and even when I do, I still don't.\"\n\nShe reportedly followed up with another IG Story quote that read, \"You are currently living at least one of the prayers you used to pray.\"\n\nAccording to court docs obtained by The Daily Mail, Maralee's relationship began before the NBA star's 30th birthday in March and continued throughout her pregnancy. Tristan has reportedly requested a paternity test.\n\nMaralee gave birth to a baby boy on Wednesday, December 1.\n\nAugust 16, 2021: Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are reportedly dating again\n\nAbout two months after their most recent split, rumors started circulating that Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan were giving things yet another go. As always, many had opinions on the reported news, and one person took to Twitter to voice how they felt about the alleged rekindling.\n\n\"At this point @khloekardashian has no self worth. Anyway...,\" @_Rutie wrote on Twitter in response to a headline from the Mirror about Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan reportedly getting back together.\n\nKhlo\u00e9, though, wouldn't stand for the hate, and she responded to the tweet immediately. \"You\u2019re telling me you made an assessment about my life because of a random blog?\" she said. \"I think that says more about you than it does about me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, since the original tweet, E! News has reported that Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are not back together, despite reports. \"They are telling people they aren't back together, but have been hanging out pretty often with True,\" a source said. Apparently, \"she wants him around and they talk every day\" and, despite everything, \"Khloe has forgiven him for what he's done and would rather just be on good terms with him.\"\n\nJuly 8, 2021: Tristan replied to one of Khlo\u00e9's steamy Instagram posts\n\nDespite reports that Tristan and Khlo\u00e9 are currently not together due to yet another cheating scandal, Tristan has proven that he's not immune to Khlo\u00e9's good looks. The basketball star just left a very thirsty comment on Khlo\u00e9's Instagram of her in a tight blue dress on the beach.\n\nTristan kept things simple, commenting with three heart-eye emojis on the pic. Fans, though, were not too happy about this.\n\n\"LEAVE HER ALONE!!!!!\" one person commented. \"Give her the peace she deserves,\" added another.\n\nInstagram\n\nApparently, we shouldn't be too surprised by Tristan's comment. According to People, \"Tristan's still trying to get Khlo\u00e9 back. He hasn't given up and he doesn't think the door is closed.\" Khlo\u00e9, meanwhile, is reportedly \"extremely disappointed in how things have played out with Tristan.\" So, we will just have to wait and see where they go from here.\n\nJune 27, 2021: Tristan celebrates Khlo\u00e9's birthday on Instagram\n\nTristan took to Instagram to wish Khlo\u00e9 a happy birthday less than a week after news of their reported split. The basketball player shared three photos with Khlo\u00e9 alongside a heartfelt caption.\n\n\"Happy birthday @khloekardashian,\" Tristan wrote. \"Thank you for being not just an amazing partner, mommy and best friend but also being the kindest, caring and most loving human being I\u2019ve ever met. Your love and spirit is contagious to all who\u2019ve met you. Thank you for always being there for me and putting our family first. I love you so much. Have an amazing day. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\"\n\nKhlo\u00e9 did not like, comment, or repost Tristan's tribute, despite doing so for many of her other friends and family members who shared photos and messages on Instagram for Khlo\u00e9's birthday.\n\nWhile E! News previously reported on the pair's breakup, according to Us Weekly, \"Khloe still loves Tristan and would take him back in a heartbeat.\" That apparently is \"not happening any time soon,\" however. According to a source, they went from spending 24/7 together to breaking up and Khlo\u00e9's currently working on the \"transition into being friendly co-parents\" and she's trying to \"separate her emotions from him.\"\n\nJune 21, 2021: Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan have reportedly broken up again\n\nKhlo\u00e9 and Tristan have reportedly broken up once again. According to E! News, Tristan has lost all of Khlo\u00e9's trust, and \"the relationship could not be repaired.\" A source told the site, \"Khloe really tried, but ultimately, felt too betrayed by him. She's done and says she will not go back.\"\n\nThe news of their breakup comes after Tristan was reportedly seen entering a bedroom with three women at a party in LA. Eyewitnesses told E!, \"He seemed like he was in a great mood and wanted to party. He was drinking and was partying into the early hours of the morning.\" He was apparently telling people he was single.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Tonight, Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan ended things a few weeks ago, but they will continue to co-parent their daughter True together. \"The two are on good terms and at the end of the day, Khloe just wants True to have a good relationship with her father,\" a source said.\n\nMarch 13, 2021: Khlo\u00e9 says she's back with Tristan\n\nOver two years after the cheating scandal that was heard around the world, Khlo\u00e9 has confirmed that she is back with Tristan and they're \"even stronger than they were before.\" In an Instagram post for Tristan's 30th birthday, Khlo\u00e9 opened up a little bit about the pair's relationship.\n\n\"The ones that are meant to be are the ones who go through everything that is designed to tear them apart and they come out even stronger than they were before,\" she said, alongside photos with Tristan and their daughter, True. Apparently, Tristan was able to gain Khlo\u00e9's trust back. \"Thank you for showing me everything you said you would,\" she wrote. \"I'm thankful that I can do absolutely nothing with you and it feels like everything.\"\n\nKhlo\u00e9 ended the note, writing, \"I hope you know today and every day how loved you are by me and so many.\"\n\nFebruary 21, 2021: Khlo\u00e9 sparks engagement rumors\n\nKhlo\u00e9 sparked engagement rumors when she promoted her new line of Good American shoes with a sexy snap that features a massive diamond ring on *that* finger. After seeing the pic, the Internet started freaking out, assuming that this meant Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan were engaged.\n\nWhen E! personality Morgan Stewart commented \"ARE THEY\" on the photo, Khlo\u00e9 fueled the engagement rumors even further by responding, \"Yep they are.\" She later clarified, though, that she wasn't confirming engagement news.\n\n\"My reply was to the question 'are they,'\" she wrote. \"My reply is 'Yep they are'...Meaning yes the shoes are dropping on 2.25.\"\n\nInstagram\n\nAccording to Page Six, the ring isn't even from Tristan, and Khlo\u00e9 has actually been seen wearing it before. So, unfortunately, it seems like the post is not an engagement announcement.\n\nThere is some good news, however. A source recently told Entertainment Tonight that Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are \"stronger than ever\" after everything they've been through. And even though Tristan is now in Boston, playing for the Boston Celtics, they are constantly in communication and Khlo\u00e9 has forgiven him for everything that has happened in the past.\n\n\"Khloe forgives Tristan at this point, but she will never forget,\" the source said. \"They are back to being committed, are still in love and giving their relationship another chance and hoping that it will succeed this time around. Tristan has been paying extra attention to Khloe and True and has been calling, FaceTiming, texting, and sending photos all the time to check in when they are not physically together. He hasn\u2019t been going out late at night with the boys or other girls.\"\n\nSo while this picture may not have been an engagement announcement, I think it's safe to say one may be coming very soon.\n\n\n\nOctober 5, 2020: Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are reportedly trying to have another baby\n\nNot only is everything reportedly \"great\" in Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan's relationship right now, but according to People, they may be adding to their family very soon. \"They are definitely planning their future together and can't wait to have another baby,\" a source shared.\n\nApparently, the pair has been living together for a while now. \"Their focus is True and they keep doing fun family activities together,\" the source said. \"Khloe really believes that things will continue to be great even after Tristan has to return to work. She is very impressed with how he has stepped up.\"\n\nAll I know is that True is the cutest and she is going to kill it as a big sis when the time comes.\n\nAugust 28, 2020: Scott Disick confirms that Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are back together on Instagram\n\nWe seemingly just got confirmation that Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are officially back together. Khlo\u00e9 recently posted a steamy bikini pic and Scott Disick couldn't help but comment. \"@Realtristan13 is a lucky man!\" he wrote.\n\nOf course, Scott is a pretty credible source when it comes to Khlo\u00e9's relationship, so I think we can all agree that this means True's parents are back on.\n\nAugust 5, 2020: Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan officially reconciled in June\n\nIt looks like forgiveness is all it took for this couple. Just a month after a report came out that Khlo\u00e9 was forgiving Tristan, People just revealed that they actually got back together in June.\n\n\"She loves having him around. He has the best relationship with True,\" the source told People. \"And he has been amazing to Khlo\u00e9 too. They are very much together and Khlo\u00e9 is beyond happy.\"\n\nHere's hoping the second time is the charm for them!\n\nJuly 2, 2020: Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are reportedly giving their relationship another try\n\nAfter almost a year and a half apart, it seems like Khlo\u00e9 may be ready to forgive Tristan. The pair is reportedly, \"giving their relationship another try.\" According to People, \"Tristan is working hard to prove himself and has been a great dad to True.\"\n\nRumors of a reconciliation have been swirling ever since Khlo\u00e9's 36th birthday. Not only was Tristan at the party, but they apparently \"acted like were back together\" while celebrating. Tristan also posted a sweet message for Khlo\u00e9 on Instagram in honor of her big day.\n\n\"I\u2019m wise enough now to know, you came into my life to show me just what it means to be an incredible person,\" he wrote. \"I appreciate how I am able to learn from and grow because of you. I thank God for the beautiful and loving woman you are to everyone, especially our daughter True. You deserve the world Koko! True and I love you mama. Happy Birthday @khloekardashian.\"\n\nAt her birthday party, Khlo\u00e9 snapped a pic with her BFF Malika Haqq. In the photo, which she later posted on Instagram, Khlo\u00e9 can be seen rocking a huge diamond ring on her left ring finger. This, of course, has led many to think that Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are not only back together, but engaged.\n\nAccording to E! News, though, while things are \"going very well\" for the couple, they are not engaged. Khloe is apparently \"very happy with where things are right now,\" but she is taking things slow.\n\nOnce the quarantine is over, Tristan will be back on the road for basketball and this separation reportedly concerns Khlo\u00e9. Though right now, \"she isn't getting ahead of herself.\" She's simply \"enjoying having [Tristan] around right now and all of the family time they have had together with True.\"\n\nJune 27, 2019: Tristan moves into Khlo\u00e9's neighborhood\n\nThough Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan may have broken up months ago, they are now closer than ever...literally, because Tristan just bought a house right outside of Khlo\u00e9's neighborhood!\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, the basketball player recently purchased a $6.5 million dollar mansion in Encino, California, which has seven bedrooms, eight baths, a pool, spa, AND an outdoor kitchen...wow.\n\n\n\nThe kicker? The new pad is just a 25-minute drive from his ex's house. Tristan assumedly bought the house due to its proximity to his 14-month-old daughter, but it's unclear what Khlo\u00e9 thinks about her ex's new location.\n\nJune 12, 2019: Khlo\u00e9 responds to claims that she started dating Tristan while he was still in a relationship with his then-pregnant girlfriend Jordan Craig\n\nKhlo\u00e9 is not here to get dragged into Tristan Thompson's latest drama that includes ANOTHER cheating scandal. On her Instagram story, Khlo\u00e9 set the record straight when it came to the start of their relationship. Some fans had begun to question Tristan again when it was revealed that his ex-girlfriend said that she was cheated on when Tristan started to date Khlo\u00e9.\n\n\"After going on some dates, Tristan told me that he had an ex that was pregnant. Obviously, I was reluctant about us continuing to date or start a relationship,\" she wrote. \"He pleaded with me that the relationship was over long before we met.\"\n\nShe even revealed that she had his friends, lawyer, and mother say that he was no longer with his ex before she got with him.\n\n\"This is my truth! The truth that I believed and trusted. If for any reason this is NOT in fact the truth, I am so completely and utterly sorry that TRISTAN and his inner circle would lie on something like this,\" she wrote on another slide. \"Truthfully, from the deepest parts of my soul I am sorry! I'm sorry for any pain that has been created either way. No woman deserves to go through anything like this!\"\n\nMay 31, 2019: Khlo\u00e9 posts cryptic message on social media\n\nKoko is known for getting cryptic on her Instagram account, so fans weren't necessarily shocked when she posted this seemingly shady post: \"Your loyalty might have kept you in some situations that common sense should've talked you out of. That's just the kind of person you are.\" While we all know Khloe is loyal AF, we can't help but wonder who it is she's actually talking about. Is this post meant for Tristan Thompson and her old ex Lamar Odom?\n\nBoth guys cheated on her and, despite their infidelity, she stayed true to the very end. Fans are wondering, though, if this is actually all about Tristan. After all, she'll be re-living their breakup in Sunday's episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Khlo\u00e9 debates her fealty to Tristan in a clip, saying \"I don't feel like I have an answer. Like, okay, I'm going to be with Tristan forever, or I'm going to break up with him... I still feel like, god, when will I ever know?\"\n\nMay 9, 2019: Khlo\u00e9's drama with Jordyn Woods is aired on a new episode of KUWTK\n\nThe most awkward part of Keeping Up with The Kardashians is the fact that it rehashes drama that occurred months ago. It's even more awkward when things transpire between the event and the airing like say, Jordyn Woods kisses Khlo\u00e9's boyfriend and then a video of Khlo\u00e9 praising the 21-year-old becomes completely cringeworthy. Well, get excited, because that's exactly what's going down on this week's ep of KUWTK!\n\nIn the episode, we see a party celebrating the launch of Kylie's cosmetic collab with her former BFF Jordyn. Everyone is in a great mood at the party, especially Khlo\u00e9, who decides to say a few words. \" And Jordyn, for you to be turning 21, I've known you forever, and I'm so proud of you and the woman you have grown into and you're growing into,\" Khlo\u00e9 says. \"And to see you guys just stick together and be best friends through thick and thin, it's such a blessing. Congratulations on everything and this'll be a huge success!\"\n\nIt's a sweet sentiment, of course, but awkward af considering everything that has gone down since. Well, just think. As hard as that speech is for us to watch, it must be one million times worse for Khlo\u00e9.\n\nApril 16, 2019: Khlo\u00e9 reportedly ignored Tristan during True's birthday party\n\nWe've got more news from True's first birthday party, and considering the video that surfaced of Khlo\u00e9 straight up ignoring Tristan at the event (see below), it's pretty much what you would expect.\n\nAccording to People, there \"was never a question\" as to whether Tristan would be invited or not, but she was still \"nervous about having him there.\" Khlo\u00e9 even had to ask her family members, who are known for speaking their minds, to \"behave and leave Tristan alone.\"\n\nAll in all, the party went well, probably because aside from a few pictures together with True, they \"had very little interaction.\"\n\nDespite their extremely rocky past, \"it's super important to Khlo\u00e9 that True spends as much time with Tristan as possible,\" People's source said. Khlo\u00e9 wants True to have a great relationship with Tristan.\"\n\nApril 14, 2019: Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan celebrate True's first birthday together\n\nOf course, Tristan was in attendance for his daughter's first birthday, but that doesn't mean Khlo\u00e9 had to give him the time of day. Women around the world cheered when Khlo\u00e9 hardcore gave her ex the cold shoulder at True's party, as documented on Instagram.\n\nIn the video, you can see that while Tristan is trying to get True, Khlo\u00e9 is too busy paying attention to literally everyone else. Khlo\u00e9 didn't get too petty, however. She did let Tristan have his moment with his daughter and hold her while they sang happy birthday.\n\nIt's good to see that things are amicable with them, but Khlo\u00e9 is still treating Tristan exactly how he deserves to be treated \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb.\n\n\n\nMarch 14, 2019: Reports surface about Tristan's role in True's life following his cheating allegations with Jordyn\n\nKhlo\u00e9 and Tristan may no longer be together, but they will forever be connected thanks to baby True. Unfortunately, while Khlo\u00e9 is constantly showing her daughter lots of love, it seems like Tristan has been pretty hands-off ever since the breakup.\n\n\"Khlo\u00e9 is getting extremely upset with Tristan because he isn\u2019t really making any effort to be involved in their daughter True\u2019s life,\" a source told Us Weekly. While Khlo\u00e9 understands that Tristan has a busy schedule and is on the road a lot, she feels like he \"has moved on\" from True. According to the source, \"Tristan\u2019s attitude seems to be, \u2018I will see True when I see her.\u2019\"\n\nObviously, Khlo\u00e9 is not happy about this, and with True's first birthday coming up, we will have to wait and see if Tristan is involved or not. While I'm sure Khlo\u00e9 wants True's father to be there, \"she can't see how he can be around her family at a party, though. Everyone is just too upset with him,\" said People. I mean...can you blame them?\n\nMarch 1, 2019: Khlo\u00e9 reacts to Jordyn's Red Table Talk interview\n\nFollowing Jordyn's tell-all interview on Red Table Talk where she claimed that nothing happened between her and Tristan aside from a peck on her way out the door, Khlo\u00e9 took to Twitter to call her out.\n\n\"Why are you lying @jordynwoods ??\" she wrote. \"If you\u2019re going to try and save yourself by going public, INSTEAD OF CALLING ME PRIVATELY TO APOLOGIZE FIRST, at least be HONEST about your story. BTW, You ARE the reason my family broke up!\"\n\nObviously many were confused. Why was Khlo\u00e9 attacking Jordyn so publicly when Tristan was just as responsible (if not more if you believe Jordyn's side of the story). Well, Khlo\u00e9 had a response to that too.\n\n\"Tristan is equally to blame but Tristan is the father of my child,\" she said. \"Regardless of what he does to me I won\u2019t do that to my daughter. He has been addressing this situation PRIVATELY. If Tristan were to lie publicly about what conspired, then yes I would address him publicly as well.\"\n\nIt's unclear what Tristan's side of the story involves and why Khlo\u00e9 seems to be believing him over Jordyn. We will have to wait and hope that Jada Pinkett Smith sits down with the two of them next.\n\nFebruary 27, 2019: Khlo\u00e9 seemingly likes tweets about Jordyn Woods' decision to publicly address the alleged incident\n\nWhile Khlo\u00e9 hasn't officially confirmed or denied the alleged cheating incident between Tristan and Jordyn, her social media activity speaks for itself. Two tweets that she \"liked\" on Twitter are extremely revealing, with one even seemingly confirming that the hook-up occurred.\n\nBoth tweets are in reference to Jordyn's upcoming appearance on the Facebook show Red Table Talk, where she will most likely discuss her side of what occurred. In a response to a tweet that said, \"Jordyn deserves a win,\" one Twitter user wrote, \"She slept with Khlo\u00e9's baby daddy, and they haven't even publicly said ONE bad thing about her, just unfollowed her, so how is that the Kardashians fault? Jordyn smeared her OWN name!\"\n\nThe other tweet that Khlo\u00e9 liked is in response to the video of Jordyn at the Red Table Talk studio. \"I really don\u2019t understand the point of this,\" @aussiedashdoll wrote. \"There\u2019s no way she can justify what she did.\"\n\nSources said that the Kardashian's aren't happy with Jordyn's decision to go on the talk show, especially because it means she will be breaking the NDA that prohibits her from talking about the famous fam. Khlo\u00e9's liked tweets about the situation not only prove that the KarJenners are angry, but it also might prove that the still alleged cheating scandal did, in fact, occur.\n\nThis also comes as Tristan is reportedly \"trying to make amends\" with Khlo\u00e9. \"Tristan has been telling Khlo\u00e9 that he feels bad and that they have a kid together and that he disrespected her as the mother of his child,\" a source told People. Of course, this is the same guy who was apparently very indifferent when the scandal initially broke, according to Us Weekly, so it's hard to believe anything that guy says these days.\n\nFebruary 26, 2019: Khlo\u00e9 makes social media debut since news of Tristan reportedly hooking up with Jordyn Woods\n\nKhlo\u00e9 made a bold statement when she posted some gorgeous pics on IG just a week after the news broke that Tristan allegedly cheated on her with Jordyn Woods. The photos featured her, Kourtney, and Kendall rocking some sexy outfits. Khlo\u00e9 herself was in a diamond bodysuit and, let me tell you, she looked fierce.\n\nWell, apparently Tristan Thompson agreed that the pic was H-O-T, because he gave it a \"like\" on Insta, and obviously, people were NOT happy.\n\nThen, things got even more interesting. When I went to go double-check that like (you know, journalistic integrity and whatnot), it was no longer there! Meaning Tristan took back is like! Which maybe even shadier than liking it to begin with.\n\nInstagram\n\nVery shady Mr. Thompson...But, then again, should we really expect anything else from him?\n\nFebruary 20, 2019: Tristan reportedly hooked up with Kylie Jenner's best friend Jordyn Woods\n\nGet ready, 'cause it's been a wild couple of hours. After news that Tristan was up partying in L.A., new reports saying that he hooked up with Kylie Jenner's BFF, Jordyn Woods started to circulate on the internet.\n\nWhile no one has outright confirmed that this is what really happened, Khlo\u00e9 seems to be hinting that it's all true. Tristan has reportedly admitted to the whole thing and it seems like things between him and Khlo\u00e9 are officially over.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 has given Tristan plenty of chances, but this one has clearly gone too far for her to be able to forgive him.\n\nA source told Us Weekly, \"Tristan isn\u2019t too worried about not seeing True, or Khlo\u00e9 establishing new rules when it comes to co-parenting. He honestly doesn\u2019t really care and was over it. He was never trying to win Khlo\u00e9 back.\"\n\nYIKES! They have since hinted that the news is real, but have still kept it under wraps. It'll definitely be interesting to see what happens when one of them finally speaks out. We'll all be waiting for that tea.\n\nFebruary 19, 2019: New rumors fuel speculation that Tristan and Khlo\u00e9 have broken up\n\nKhlo\u00e9 and Tristan have been in a long-distance relationship for months, with Tristan living in Cleveland for his NBA team while Khlo\u00e9 is taking care of True in LA. So, when Tristan visited LA, you would think he would see Khlo\u00e9, right?\n\nWhile we don't know exactly how he spent his whole trip to LA, we do know how he spent his Saturday night. According to the Daily Mail, Tristan partied until the early hours of the morning in West Hollywood. While out on the town, the basketball player was reportedly \"being flirty, hitting up girls.\" Meanwhile, Khlo\u00e9 was nowhere to be found.\n\nIt is, of course, possible that Tristan visited Khlo\u00e9 and his daughter on this trip to LA, but there is no evidence of it on social media, which is surprising considering how much Khlo\u00e9 usually shares. A reunion between daughter and father would have made for some great Insta story content.\n\nAll of this comes amid rumors that Tristan and Khlo\u00e9 have finally called it quits, and while nothing is officially confirmed, their breakup is seeming like more and more of a given.\n\nFebruary 14, 2019: Tristan sends Khlo\u00e9 lavish Valentine's Day gifts\n\nSo, the world is still pretty confused about Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan's relationship status, and his V-Day gift to her didn't really help clear anything up. The basketball player sent Khlo\u00e9 a gorgeous floral display for the romantic holiday, which she shared on her Instagram story.\n\nInstagram\n\nYes, it is super sweet, but Khlo\u00e9 showed off the gift among the dozens of other treats that she got from her family and various brands, not really singling it out in any special way. She also captioned the pic, \"Daddy and baby True,\" which makes me think that that's all she thinks of him these days. Not in a romantic way, but as True's dad. That's it.\n\nThe two didn't celebrate the holiday together either. Khlo\u00e9 seemed to spend all day with True, opening gifts and enjoying some V-Day treats, while Tristan was most likely in Cleveland (he had a home game the day before). So, while their Valentine's Day celebration (or lack thereof) definitely doesn't clear anything up regarding their relationship status, I'm taking it as a sign that things aren't going well.\n\nFebruary 13, 2019: New details emerge about the status of Khlo\u00e9's relationship with Tristan\n\nRemember Tristan Thompson? It may have been a while since you last heard that name so let me refresh your memory. He is the father of Khlo\u00e9's baby, True, and he allegedly cheated on Khlo\u00e9 literally days before True was born. While Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan have spent the last ten months working on their relationship since the scandal, he has been MIA recently, so has the pair officially broken up?\n\nAccording to People, Khlo\u00e9 \"rarely talks about\" Tristan, which obviously isn't a sign that things are going well. \"Khlo\u00e9 and True are happy in Los Angeles,\" a source told the site. \"They spend very little time in Cleveland, where Tristan is. She very much acts like a single mom.\"\n\nWhen Khlo\u00e9 celebrated True's ten-month birthday, Tristan was nowhere to be found. In fact, the two haven't been seen together in a month.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 seemingly is doing just fine without Tristan these days. \"Her whole life is True,\" the source told People. She also just got a gorgeous new haircut, which is the telltale sign of a breakup, if you ask me.\n\nJanuary 16, 2019: Khlo\u00e9's sisters, Kourtney and Kim, share their thoughts on Tristan's cheating scandal\n\n\n\nIt seems like the Kardashian sisters are divided over whether or not Khlo\u00e9 should've stayed with Tristan Thompson after his cheating scandal.\n\nWhile playing Plead the Fifth on Watch What Happens Live, Kourtney was asked whether or not she would've stayed with Tristan Thompson if she were in Khlo\u00e9's shoes. Instead of pleading the fifth, Kourtney revealed that she would've stayed with him and Kim opened up about how she doesn't agree with her decision.\n\n\"From seeing everything that happened. It's so easy and quick to be like, 'Oh my god, leave him. Leave him.' It's so much harder to stay and have the whole public think you're an idiot for staying,\" Kim said.\n\nAndy Cohen and Khlo\u00e9 started laughing since it seemed like Kim was calling her an idiot. Talk about AWKWARD. Check out the clip below:\n\nJanuary 2, 2019: Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan have a complicated start to the New Year\n\nNew year, same drama. Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson are back for another complicated 365 days of cheating scandals, dramatic Instagram story quotes, and lots of baby pics. The couple rang in the New Year together at a party in Cleveland, and there was a fair share of evidence showing them having a good time.\n\nInstagram\n\nOf course, it wasn't all love and laughs for this complicated couple. The Shade Room recently posted a video of Khlo\u00e9 grinding on Tristan on the dance floor, while Tristan straight up gives her the cold shoulder. Of course, Khlo\u00e9 was not happy and the whole exchange is super awkward.\n\nSo, there's a really good chance that Tristan just didn't see Khlo\u00e9 (because who could deny her, did you see how good she looked??), but of course, it's Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan so fans always assume the worst.\n\nIn the rest of the pics from the night, the pair seemed to be having a good time, so maybe we assume should best intentions on Tristan's part?\n\nHere's to what hopefully is a drama-free year for the couple!\n\nDecember 24, 2018: Tristan missed out on Khlo\u00e9's family's annual Christmas Eve party\n\nWhile True Thompson and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian stole the show in matching outfits at the annual Kardashian Jenner Christmas Eve party this year, Tristan was nowhere to be found. Don't worry, though, because there's actually a totally reasonable explanation for why he missed the party.\n\nAccording to E! News, Tristan \"doesn't have a lot of flexibility\" when it comes to his basketball schedule. He had a game on the 23rd and 26th, which didn't leave a lot of time to head to LA for the party.\n\nWhile Khlo\u00e9 could have spent Christmas in Ohio with Tristan, it was important for her to be with family for the holidays, especially after she missed Thanksgiving in LA to be with him.\n\nRelated Story Inside the Wild 2018 Kardashian Christmas Party\n\n\"There was nothing more special than seeing True with her cousins on Christmas morning,\" a source told E!. \"There was no way she was going to miss the family Christmas Eve party and being a part of opening presents all together on Christmas morning.\"\n\nDecember 7, 2018: Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan reportedly considering having another baby\n\nThings between Tristan and Khlo\u00e9 are MUCH better these days, so much so that Khlo\u00e9 is even considering getting pregnant again with the basketball player.\n\n\"Now that she's a mom, Khlo\u00e9's never been happier,\" a source told Entertainment Tonight. \"She has wanted this baby more than anything and motherhood has proven to be even more incredible than she imagined.\"\n\nApparently, the couple is in \"such a good place now\" after spending Thanksgiving together last month. \"Her relationship with Tristan is so good,\" said the source. \"They made it through some really dark times, but she's happy that she gave him a second chance because he's stepped up and is not only an amazing father to True, but he's been such a rock for Khlo\u00e9. They're really just so in love.\"\n\nThey're doing so well, that Khlo\u00e9 wants to start trying for a second kid. Getting pregnant with True wasn't easy and Khlo\u00e9 is \"aware it may take some time again,\" so she doesn't want to wait too long.\n\nIn other Kardashian news, Kylie is also interested in having baby number two with her bae, Travis Scott.\n\n\"Kylie and Travis are going to wait until he's finished his [Astroworld] tour before trying for another baby,\" ET's source said. \"They want to have another child soon so it's close in age to Stormi, but they do not want to do this while he's busy on the road.\"\n\nSince their first kids were born just months apart, and seem to have a close relationship, the sisters are apparently excited about the prospect of getting pregnant together again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kylie and Khlo\u00e9 would love to be pregnant together again. And it seems like the timing could work out that way,\" said the source. \"It was a real bonding experience for them, but more importantly, it\u2019s been amazing for their daughters to be so close in age. There are so many kids/grandkids in that family, that's really where the family's attention is. It's all about the next generation.\"\n\nNovember 26, 2018: Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan celebrate Thanksgiving together\n\nKhlo\u00e9 and Tristan had a quiet Thanksgiving together, as she joined him in Ohio for the big holiday. While many fans were questioning why Khlo\u00e9 decided to not be with her sisters for Thanksgiving dinner, she quickly shut down the haters with a couple of tweets.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 also had to defend her sister Kendall on Friday night after she booed Tristan during a basketball game, where she was cheering on the Philadelphia 76ers' with Ben Simmons.\n\nA fan called out Khlo\u00e9 for her being okay with Kendall booing him during the game, but still supporting Tristan after he cheated on her.\n\nDespite what people believed to be a shady interaction between Kendall and Tristan, the two of them were all smiles when they saw each other at the game.\n\nMitchell Leff // Getty Images\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers ended up winning the game, so it's safe to say that the two of them are even now.\n\nNovember 18, 2018: Khlo\u00e9 and her sisters tell the story of True's birth\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashian's retelling of True's birth confirmed what we already knew: that the baby's delivery, which occurred just days after it was revealed that Tristan had cheated of Khlo\u00e9, was awkward af.\n\nNot only were there some savage moments from Khloe's sisters (Tristan saying \"girls change your life,\" with Kourt responding, \"we can only pray.\" AMEN), but there was also so much tension.\n\ngiphy\n\nAfter the ep aired, Khlo\u00e9 shared a pic from the occasion on her Instagram story, and you can feel the awkwardness in the photo, let me tell you.\n\nInstagram\n\n\"This is one of the most awkward photos I have seen in a long time,\" she wrote about the pic. \"You can feel the tension lol but it makes me laugh for some reason. I am definitely one of those people that when I am uncomfortable I nervously laugh. Welcome to my labor lol.\"\n\nWe're glad she can laugh about it because all we can manage is a cringe.\n\nNovember 15, 2018: Sources claim all is well between Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan despite speculation of him cheating\n\nForget what you heard because Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are reportedly doing very well despite breakup rumors. A source told TMZ that the couple is \"still together and going strong.\" According to the site, Khlo\u00e9 hasn't been in Cleveland because she's filming a new season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, and then she wanted to stay with her family this past week amid the California fires.\n\nThe reality star will be heading to Ohio soon, however. She plans to spend Thanksgiving with Tristan and True in Cleveland as a family.\n\nThis all comes as the cheating episodes of KUWTK are airing on TV, episodes which Tristan refused to watch. But hey, if they're doing better, why relive the past?\n\nNovember 7, 2018: Tristan refuses to watch 'KUWTK' episodes centered around him cheating on Khlo\u00e9\n\nWhile Tristan Thompson seemed to have no issue cheating on Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian when she was nine months pregnant back in April, he has no interest in reliving the experience through Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, when Khlo\u00e9 asked Tristan if he wanted to watch the KUWTK episode that addressed the cheating scandal, \"the response was a firm no.\" Apparently, while Khlo\u00e9 already screened the ep before it aired, she wanted to watch it live with her boyfriend.\n\nTristan has a lot of other things to worry about. A source close to him told Us that \"he is focused on basketball, and the Cavaliers are struggling this season.\" Watching the episode would only create further distractions, and \"there wasn't any need for that.\" Of course, he could have not cheated on her in the first place, then this issue wouldn't exist at all.\n\nOctober 29, 2018: Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan reconcile\n\nKhlo\u00e9 and Tristan seem to be back on good terms after Khlo\u00e9's recent vacation with Kim and their kids.\n\nThe two of them returned from their big trip to Bali and Khlo\u00e9 had a very special surprise waiting for her at home when she got back. Tristan got her some special balloons to welcome her back and Khloe was super excited to share them on her Instagram story\n\nInstagram\n\nSoon after, she posted another photo of a quote that seemed to be hinting at a reconciliation.\n\nInstagram\n\n\"Please stop overthinking life like you have an answer to every feeling or situation. That's not how life works We figure it all out by just living, by f*cking up, by missing an. opportunity, by seeking advice and not taking it. We learn what's important and what isn't. Sometimes we have no f*cking idea what to do and it's scary but it's okay. Always trust your gut and know that everything will work out exactly the way it is supposed to be. It always does. Relax, we were never in control anyway.\"\n\nOctober 23, 2018: New reports surfaced about Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan's relationship\n\nSix months after Tristan's first cheating scandal, which occurred just a few days before the birth of their child, True Thompson, Khlo\u00e9 finally \"seems over Tristan,\" according to People.\n\nThis feeling has manifested itself in her move to Cleveland, which she hasn't rescheduled, despite postponing it three weeks ago. \"It doesn\u2019t seem to bother her that she isn\u2019t with Tristan in Cleveland,\" said People's source. \"She seems to know what she wants in her life right now. And it definitely doesn\u2019t seem like she wants to be with Tristan.\"\n\nAs far as their future, however, Khlo\u00e9 hasn't yet made a decision. \"Khlo\u00e9 isn\u2019t saying that she and Tristan split. It seems she hasn\u2019t decided yet what she wants to do about their relationship,\" the source said. \"And she seems fine about this.\"\n\n\n\nOctober 6, 2018: Khlo\u00e9 reportedly postpones her move to Cleveland following new cheating allegations\n\n\n\nAfter a week of posting emotional Instagrams amid new rumors that Tristan Thompson is once again cheating, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian has postponed her move to Cleveland. Khlo\u00e9 was planning on returning to Ohio to live with Tristan as the basketball season begins, but, according to People, this is no longer the case.\n\n\"It\u2019s of course difficult to trust someone 100 percent who cheated days before he was about to become a dad,\" said People's source. \"Khlo\u00e9 still struggles with this sometimes. She wants to move back to Cleveland, but she isn\u2019t sure what date she is [going]. The move is postponed for now. She seems very upset about leaving her family. She had the best summer in L.A.\"\n\nAll of this is happening as Keeping Up with the Kardashians is preparing to air the original cheating scandal, which occurred about six months ago, right before True Thompson was born. This has caused Khlo\u00e9 to become \"overwhelmed and exhausted,\" according to the source.\n\n\"Khlo\u00e9 has every reason to occasionally feel [that way],\u201d they added. \"She\u2019s a new mom, a first-time mom, and her TV show is currently replaying one of the most emotional times in her life. It\u2019s a lot.\"\n\nSeptember 27, 2018: Khlo\u00e9's sister Kim unfollowed Tristan on social media\n\n\n\nIt seems like we're about to get a lot more info on the Tristan cheating scandal and how Khlo\u00e9's family reacted to the original news back in April. In a mid-season preview for Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kim Kardashian is seen saying, \"They have another video of him.\" While we don't know for sure that she's referring to Tristan, the promo then switches to a pic of Khlo\u00e9, who looks less than happy. So, we can assume Kim means the paparazzi got another vid of Tristan with a random girl.\n\n\"Unfollowed,\" says Kim, and we know she did, actually unfollow him on Instagram. \"I hate him. Sorry, not sorry.\" Khlo\u00e9, on the other hand, seems more calm as she prepares to give birth to her baby, True. \u201cThe things I can control, I have to be able to control,\" she says.\n\nWe can't wait for the second half of KUWTK to see what Khlo\u00e9's family thought about everything that went down with Tristan, though we already know they don't think too highly of him.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018: Tristan reportedly caught flirting with another woman\n\nTristan Thompson was, once again, spotted getting very close to not-Khlo\u00e9 at a club in LA recently. According to Us Weekly, \"Tristan and a girl were chatting and flirting throughout the night. They were very touchy-feely. He had his hand on her butt.\"\n\nKhlo\u00e9, who will be moving back to Cleveland when basketball season kicks off, is apparently unbothered by the allegation. A source says that she believes Tristan, who promised to \"never betray her again.\"\n\nHer family, however, is not on the same page. \"Everyone is flabbergasted, but her family has learned to keep their opinions quiet,\" said a source. \"People underestimate the threshold of what she\u2019ll put up with for love.\"\n\nSeptember 19, 2018: Khlo\u00e9 will reportedly move back to Cleveland during Tristan's upcoming NBA season with the Cavaliers\n\nIt looks like LA will be losing a Kardashian. Khlo\u00e9 plans to move back to Cleveland with Tristan for basketball season, which is about to start up again soon. While it's good to see that the couple will still be together while Tristan plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers, a source told People that the move will be hard on Khloe.\n\n\"He has games in October. They are all moving back to Cleveland, and it\u2019s hard for Khlo\u00e9. She will really miss Kris and her sisters,\" they told People.\n\nDespite the big move, the source said that they plan to make frequent visits back to LA to try to keep the family together.\n\n\"It\u2019s not going to be easy for her,\" the source told People. \"But she is committed to keeping her family together. And Tristan has shown that he is committed to Khlo\u00e9, so Khlo\u00e9 will make it work.\"\n\nWhile Khlo\u00e9 plans to make the big move, it looks like another Kardashian is staying put.\n\nKim doesn't plan to move to Chicago with Kanye, despite the fact that he recently announced that he will be moving back there soon.\n\n\"Kim plans on spending more time in Chicago, but she isn\u2019t moving there full-time,\" a source told People.\n\nThe source also told People that Kim believes that a move wouldn't make sense for the kids right now and that it's likely that Kanye will change his mind and move back to LA soon.\n\n\"She will be supportive of Kanye\u2019s plans and they do have a house in Chicago too. Kanye has a tendency though to change his mind quickly, so she is just going along with his plans because it makes him happy,\" the source said. \"Next week, something else might make him happier.\"\n\nAugust 1, 2018: Tristan shows Khlo\u00e9's latest Instagram post some love\n\nDespite rumors that the couple isn't doing well, Tristan and Khlo\u00e9 seem to be doing just fine. Tristan even commented on Khlo\u00e9's Instagram featuring pink and blue beach waves and the caption, \"take me please.\"\n\nTristan adorab", "images":
