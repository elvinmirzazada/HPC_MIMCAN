When there are lots of rumors, we have these family group chats and we threaten each other's lives if we speak for the other one, so for the safety of my life\u2026,\" Kardashian revealed to the host.\n\nWhen she puts it like that, a sardine smoothie sounds like a small price to pay!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312im_/http://www.instyle.com/img/covers/newsletter-signup-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312im_/https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2017/11/111617-kim-kardashian.jpg?itok=4SFHyPNv", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111617-kim-kardashian.jpg?itok=_RXqzLCT", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111617-kim-kardashian.jpg?itok=_RXqzLCT", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312/http://www.instyle.com/news/kim-kardashian-refuses-to-talk-about-kylie-khloe-pregnancies", "title": "Kim Kardashian Would Rather Drink a Sardine Smoothie Than Discuss Her Sisters's Pregnancies", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Videos,Celebrity,News,Celebrity Moms,Baby News,Kim Kardashian West,Khloe Kardashian,Kylie Jenner", "news_keywords": "Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian The Late Late Show, Kim Kardashian Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts, Kim Kardashian Khlo\u00e9 Kylie", "description": "Kim Kardashian proved that family loyalty comes first as she opted to drink a disgusting \"sardine smoothie\" rather than dish on her sisters Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kylie Jenner's rumored pregnancies.", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Would Rather Drink a Sardine Smoothie Than Discuss Her Sisters's Pregnancies", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312/http://www.instyle.com/news/kim-kardashian-refuses-to-talk-about-kylie-khloe-pregnancies", "description": "That's some family loyalty.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111617-kim-kardashian.jpg?itok=_RXqzLCT"}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://www.instyle.com/news/kim-kardashian-refuses-to-talk-about-kylie-khloe-pregnancies", "description": "Kim Kardashian proved that family loyalty comes first as she opted to drink a disgusting \"sardine smoothie\" rather than dish on her sisters Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kylie Jenner's rumored pregnancies.", "media": "http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111617-kim-kardashian.jpg?itok=_RXqzLCT"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312im_/http://www.instyle.com/news/kim-kardashian-refuses-to-talk-about-kylie-khloe-pregnancies", "title": "Kim Kardashian Would Rather Drink a Sardine Smoothie Than Discuss Her Sisters's Pregnancies", "description": "That's some family loyalty.", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111617-kim-kardashian.jpg?itok=_RXqzLCT"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171116193312if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/p8XP7A7kvzM?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
