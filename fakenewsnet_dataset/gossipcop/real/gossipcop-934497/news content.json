In fact, she never even thought she\u2019d live this long!\n\nSpeaking to Ellen DeGeneres on the comedienne\u2019s talk show on Thursday, Fonda said, \u201cIf you had told me when I was 20 or 30 that I would actually still be acting, still active at 80 on a show like this, I would have said, \u2018You\u2019re out of your mind. There\u2019s no way.\u2019 No, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d live this long. Everyday I get up and I want to pinch myself. I feel very blessed, but I\u2019ve worked for it.\u201d\n\nAfter taking a 15 year break from 1990 to 2005, Fonda has since been working consistently in movies and TV and is currently starring in the Netflix show Grace & Frankie as well as the upcoming movie Book Club.\n\nIt\u2019s a much different life than she thought she\u2019d have. Fonda admitted she thought she\u2019d \u201cdie lonely and probably from alcohol or something like that.\u201d\n\nGetty (2)\n\n\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m not an addict, and I\u2019m 80 and I\u2019m working\u2014it\u2019s just a miracle to me,\u201d she explained.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jane Fonda Says She Tried to Set Up Ex Ted Turner on a Dating App\n\nThe actress opened up about how differently she looks at life now that she has so much experience behind her. After admitting that she wouldn\u2019t want to be in her 20s again, she is thankful for the wisdom she\u2019s gained since.\n\n\u201cIf you have a whole lot of time behind you and just a little in front of you, as is the case with me, I can look back and say, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve survived that,'\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, friends have died. There\u2019s been divorces; there\u2019s been all kinds of difficult things. I survived. You don\u2019t sweat the small stuff, right? You don\u2019t make mountains out of mole hills.\u201d\n\nBook Club hits theaters Friday, May 18.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/d18VIFp1C8LuRxwfqPOvIwf-JTg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/jane-fonda-lily-tomlin-80-for-brady-premiere-031623-1-3c62781a0cba44649314a991f72d4542.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-wVXgLZM5pzT0L47pSqCpmD0bek=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(705x198:707x200)/Hannah-Waddingham-060123-df2b04f4f1a1447e9c50755ff623c17a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ln2wjrjHw4RC8uG08v7wVXbRZaQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/jane-fonda1-1-e522266c4c154d9e91c6d2ee4e1d39ea.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/F_3QJnKWfrs36629UGul1i0ohho=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x612:941x614)/Jane-Fonda-Family-021623-bf49cf09d2d0473797cbacc7d2a7a069.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/PPMN7zj-FC1qAnK3ArOKu6DDjU0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/fonda-c590d6666a8a46b887012d294c4d6cbb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/DyZ_ZwdtFOXjNQvHpUUMvQ2H3q0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(344x509:346x511)/Grace-and-Frankie-Reunion-01-102422-42b0657c900948a3873d8fe2f96f0e72.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9y1UJq2E9oAF_m6LjfxoIqWqlfE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Jane-Fonda-Says-She-Saw-Michael-Jackson-Naked-When-He-Visited-Her-On-Set-051623-1-a175fad66cb4421a97f12fe530a9c2b2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/PdmuXa8jFg1knk7lAoblP85r5aI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/jane-fonda-80-for-brady-luncheon-panel-022723-1-4fbae580f02c48f895c6544eb4698071.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/oO1iJhwRtyXS8cdbQrTI7tKVgUY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x19:721x21)/julis-louis-dreyfus-032723-1-165d92ede5794f7090d98390d2861ab2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/5A0PuPYEdyWMFFZrxzIyNJWRc_k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Jane-Fonda-Assumed-She-Wouldnt-Live-Past-30-Amid-Battle-with-Bulimia-020323-5d5c1b60e37c489bb8889995ec9ec1f2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Kj68tpAeA-PeDPVVdAXqEHHDlPY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/People_Mag_Jane_Fonda_02_0502-a94c9004a8cf4c07a86b910bc79d239f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qq03P1NZ5enanr5CjKeKih4sagk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/tout-whoopi-goldberg-anne-hathaway-ellen-degeneres-fd6f282a4c9548e6b459e83eab3458c8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/_1bKBMM42p9qZPbagI-k-Yoyx0M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x9:721x11)/Jane-Fonda-Candice-Bergen-Mary-Steenburgen-Play-Never-Have-I-Ever-051223-fa3c228f38424b5f93f61a6fe24484ab.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/i8n088vAqt2DOO8CuQZNC8x-wEo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/janefonda05272023-39-8af9f96d87134d77b5abad1c1fe5b433.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/vACy6Fz3FMspp7YCavpgQNmJHPI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/People_Mag_Jane_Fonda_cover-tout-47b3bcc142b543b7ae1233309543e806.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/oJffKNxK9hKFb5a2FJREbUyDiwA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(614x156:616x158)/eighty-for-brady-111522-4-09bf5eb7255e4bb3a18283cfc8de209d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tEh0xWSRlNjJzAc0WRVtmvk2woc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/jane-fonda-ted-turner-20171209_21-42cbf47c0d2f4bdca00890c0742b9c13.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/mA1wE0wSCtKfz3jRhyG8vZn-PNc=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nigel-Smith-fe1f8d013d46489e9da00b452068e5ea.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/PPMN7zj-FC1qAnK3ArOKu6DDjU0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/fonda-c590d6666a8a46b887012d294c4d6cbb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nigel Smith", "Nigel Smith Is The Senior Movies News Editor For People.
