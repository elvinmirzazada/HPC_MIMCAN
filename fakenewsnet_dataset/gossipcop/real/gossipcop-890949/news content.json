Earlier reports were incorrect and not confirmed by his representatives,\u201d Leto\u2019s reps said in a statement. A person familiar with the situation told TheWrap that the confusion stemmed from Ratner\u2019s mention of being in talks with Leto at an event, but said that no official agreement was ever made.\n\nThe clarification comes after the Los Angeles Times released an expose on Ratner in which six women accused him of sexual harassment and assault. As TheWrap first reported, Playboy has put all projects between their production banner, Alta Loma Entertainment, and Ratner\u2019s Ratpac-Dune Entertainment on hold in the wake of the report. Ratner had been attached to direct the film, and Hefner was attached as executive producer prior to his death on Sept. 27.\n\nActresses Natasha Henstridge and Olivia Munn are among those who accused Ratner, with Henstridge saying he \u201cforced her to perform oral sex,\u201d while Munn says Ratner masturbated in front of her in his trailer when she went to deliver a meal. Years later, Munn said she ran into Ratner at a CAA party, where he boasted of ejaculating onto magazine covers featuring her image. Ratner, through his attorney Martin Singer, disputed the accounts.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shanola-hampton-found-jesse-l-martin-the-irrational.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/JaredLeto.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/beyonce-renaissance-tour-inglewood.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/claudia-eller.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/JaredLeto.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nascar.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/JaredLeto.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster", "Lawrence Yee", "Sharon Knolle", "Loree Seitz", "Lucas Manfredi", "Box Office Reporter", "Jeremy.Fuster Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin"], "canonical_link": "https://thewrap.com/jared-leto-never-signed-play-hugh-hefner-brett-ratners-biopic/", "title": "Jared Leto Never Signed on to Play Hugh Hefner in Brett Ratner\u2019s Biopic", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jared Leto Never Signed on to Play Hugh Hefner in Brett Ratner's Biopic - TheWrap", "description": "\"Earlier reports were incorrect and not confirmed,\" Leto's reps tell TheWrap", "url": "https://thewrap.com/jared-leto-never-signed-play-hugh-hefner-brett-ratners-biopic/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/JaredLeto.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "published_time": "2017-11-01T22:22:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-01T23:07:00+00:00"}, "author": "Jeremy Fuster", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jeremyfuster", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Jeremy Fuster", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Jared Leto Never Signed on to Play Hugh Hefner in Brett Ratner\u2019s Biopic", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/jared-leto-never-signed-play-hugh-hefner-brett-ratners-biopic/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-11-01T15:22:42-07:00", "parsely-section": "news", "parsely-author": "Jeremy Fuster", "article-tags": "}", "article-section": "news", "article-categories": "news", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509574962.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
