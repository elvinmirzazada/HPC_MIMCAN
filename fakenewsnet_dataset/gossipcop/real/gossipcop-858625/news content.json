She will be relaxing for the next few days.\u201d\n\nBrandy was bound for New York\u2019s JFK Airport before the incident. She had been scheduled to perform in Brooklyn on Saturday night.\n\nThe singer and actress is best known for songs such as \u201cThe Boy Is Mine\u201d and \u201cHave You Ever,\u201d and for her starring role in the sitcom \u201cMoesha.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/06/02/SS552VVTUI5G3K2FRSL2NULLU4.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NYDN-LOGO-WHITE-J.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/06/02/SS552VVTUI5G3K2FRSL2NULLU4.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sblendorio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/06/02/singer-brandy-hospitalized-after-losing-consciousness-on-plane/", "title": "Singer Brandy hospitalized after losing consciousness on plane", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "The songstress was hospitalized Friday after falling unconscious on a plane before takeoff.", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Singer Brandy hospitalized after losing consciousness on plane", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/06/02/singer-brandy-hospitalized-after-losing-consciousness-on-plane/", "description": "Singer Brandy Norwood was hospitalized Friday after she lost consciousness on a plane before takeoff.
