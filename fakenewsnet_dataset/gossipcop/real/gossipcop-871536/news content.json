In order to find their lead, to play young Loung Ung, the casting directors set up a game, rather disturbing in its realism: they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for, and then to snatch it away. The director would pretend to catch the child, and the child would have to come up with a lie. \u2018Srey Moch [the girl ultimately chosen for the part] was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time,\u2019 Jolie says. \u2018When she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion. All these different things came flooding back.\u2019 Jolie then tears up. \u2018When she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didn\u2019t have enough money for a nice funeral.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome reporters and readers raised concerns about the casting process. Jolie responded in a statement, saying the audition had been taken out of context, and added she was upset that \u201ca pretend exercise in an improvisation . . . had been written about as if it was a real scenario.\u201d She also stated \u201cthe suggestion that real money was taken from a child during an audition is false and upsetting. I would be outraged myself if this had happened.\u201d\n\nOn August 1, Jolie\u2019s lawyer contacted V.F., saying Peretz had \u201cmistakenly\u201d reported the incident, and asked us to run a statement, excerpts of which follow: \u201cThe casting crew showed the children the camera and sound recording material, explaining to them that they were going to be asked to act out a part. . . . The children were not tricked as some have suggested. . . . All of the children auditioning were made aware of the fictional aspect of the exercise and were tended to at all times by relatives or guardians from NGOs. . . . We apologize for any misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nJolie\u2019s lawyer also asked us to remove the original paragraph from the online version of Peretz\u2019s story and to publish the above statement prominently, with the title \u201cAngelina Jolie Correction\u201d in the October edition of V.F. and also on VF.com.\n\nIn response to these requests, V.F. reviewed the transcript and audiotape of Peretz\u2019s interview with Jolie for the story. Peretz had recorded it on two devices. A transcript of the relevant section is reproduced below.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6564cb9e766ac2eb76f98953/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654a761b69c700a1da9899f3/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654530d9e17e82085c7685ab/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660159ee60bb2d438ba5ff/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655e03122d366cc549738941/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655291b94562f3d29015ecde/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6553bf2a60d80e2627df6ac4/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65401263f3d909b2b29677e0/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6543bb76cfc2a4411ada29a5/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978bb411bd71e4b33f103c2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654d0aa9eb254baaf96dbf60/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5847182e0f5275fb6442209e/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/656510d0affa7b4408631071/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655cd9eca742a3b1491f84e3/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6553a5425c1af6c97cc3c433/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978bb411bd71e4b33f103c2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Vanity Fair"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/08/vanity-fair-responds-to-angelina-jolies-comments-related-to-its-september-cover-story", "title": "Vanity Fair Responds to Angelina Jolie\u2019s Comments Related to Its September Cover Story", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "After reviewing the audiotape, V.F. stands by its story as published.", "id": "5983904c1dc63c45b7b1dae7", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5983904c1dc63c45b7b1dae7", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"After reviewing the audiotape, V.F. stands by its story as published.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978bb411bd71e4b33f103c2/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/t-angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978bb411bd71e4b33f103c2/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/t-angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png\"}", "og": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978bb411bd71e4b33f103c2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Vanity Fair Responds to Angelina Jolie\u2019s Comments Related to Its September Cover Story", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/08/vanity-fair-responds-to-angelina-jolies-comments-related-to-its-september-cover-story"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-08-03T21:26:29.269Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-03T21:26:29.269Z", "author": "Vanity Fair"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978bb411bd71e4b33f103c2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Vanity Fair Responds to Angelina Jolie\u2019s Comments Related to Its September Cover Story"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978bb411bd71e4b33f103c2/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/t-angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501795589.269, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
