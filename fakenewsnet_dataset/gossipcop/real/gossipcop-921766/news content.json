The grandson of professional wrestler Peter \"High Chief\" Fanene Maivia and son of wrestler Rocky Johnson, the young Johnson grew up watching his father perform in the ring. With no plans to follow in his footsteps, Johnson played college football at the University of Miami, showing promise with his size and athleticism until being slowed by injuries.\n\nBecoming 'The Rock'\n\nWith few prospects in professional football, Johnson turned to wrestling, debuting in the WWE against the Brooklyn Brawler in Texas. After a couple more matches, including a tag team win with Bart Sawyer, the WWE signed him under the name Flex Kavana. A year later, he joined The Nation of Domination, eventually taking over its leadership and calling himself The Rock.\n\nHe later joined another band of elite wrestlers known as The Corporation and began a notorious feud with Steve Austin. Also known as \"The People's Champ,\" The Rock went on to win a combined 17 WWE titles over his acclaimed career.\n\nMovies and TV\n\n'Scorpion King'\n\nOutside the wrestling ring, The Rock launched a successful acting career, dropping the stage name and simply going by Dwayne Johnson. He first made a big splash as the Scorpion King, a supernatural bad guy, in 2001's The Mummy Returns. Johnson returned to this role the following year for The Scorpion King. Trying his hand at comedy, he appeared in 2005's Be Cool with John Travolta and Uma Thurman and 2007's The Game Plan.\n\n'Driver,' 'Fast & Furious' Franchise\n\nJohnson's acting career to continued to thrive through his appearances in such films as Driver (2010) and Fast & Furious 6 (2013). In 2014, he starred as the titular strong man in Hercules. Johnson also returned to wrestling from time to time, including a 2014 appearance with Hulk Hogan and Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania 30.\n\nHBO's 'Ballers'\n\nIn 2015, Johnson dominated the big screen with two big action films. He appeared in Furious Seven and starred in San Andreas. Johnson also debuted his first dramatic comedy series that same year, playing Spencer Strasmore, a retired pro footballer turned financial planner, on Ballers.\n\n'Central Intelligence,' 'Moana,' 'Baywatch,' 'Jumanji'\n\nIn 2016, after teaming up with Kevin Hart for the action-comedy Central Intelligence, Johnson voiced the demigod Maui for the Disney animated hit Moana. He was a busy man in 2017, taking on starring roles in The Fate of the Furious, a big-screen adaptation of the 1990s lifeguard series Baywatch and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.\n\n'Skyscraper,' 'Rampage,' 'Hobbs & Shaw'\n\nThe good vibes continued into 2018, with Jumanji racking up the ticket sales en route to becoming the actor's highest-grossing film to date. He also managed to stand out during the blitz of advertising accompanying the Super Bowl in February, debuting a trailer for the movie Skyscraper, in which he partakes in death-defying stunts with a prosthetic leg.\n\nThat same day, Johnson announced he would be hosting a 10-episode unscripted competition show, The Titan Games, to \"create a platform that gave everyday people the opportunity to change their lives and do something extraordinary.\"\n\nNext up for the action star was Rampage, based on the popular 1980s arcade game, which hit theaters a few months before the July release of Skyscraper.\n\nJohnson returned to his wrestling roots by appearing as himself in Fighting with My Family (2019), based on the true story of female wrestling champion Saraya \"Paige\" Bevis. Later that year, he was back in action mode with the Fast & Furious spinoff Hobbs & Shaw, alongside Jason Statham.\n\n'Young Rock'\n\nIn 2021, Young Rock, a television series about the life of Johson, premiered. The show stars Johnson and other actors playing younger versions of the actor.\n\nXFL Co-Owner\n\nIn August 2020, Johnson announced that he teamed up with his wife and a sports management company to buy the XFL, which went bankrupt earlier in the year, for $15 million. \"The acquisition of the XFL with my talented partners, Dany Garcia and Gerry Cardinale, is an investment for me that's rooted deeply in two things\u2014my passion for the game and my desire to always take care of the fans,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"With pride and gratitude for all that I've built with my own two hands, I plan to apply these callouses to the XFL, and look forward to creating something special for the players, fans, and everyone involved for the love of football.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn August 2019, Johnson tied the knot with his longtime girlfriend, singer/music producer Lauren Hashian. The two are parents to daughters Jasmine Lia (b. December 2015) and Tiana Gia (b. April 2018).\n\nJohnson also has a daughter, Simone Alexandra, from his first marriage.
