Period,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of the stories are horrific and need to be brought to light. This story, about my husband, Carter Oosterhouse, on the other hand, is now taking it too far and boundaries are being crossed.\u201d\n\nOosterhouse \u2014 who has appeared on TLC\u2019s Trading Spaces (and is slated to star in the show\u2019s reboot in spring 2018) and HGTV shows including Carter Can and Red Hot & Green \u2014 was accused of sexual misconduct by a former makeup artist in an article published by The Hollywood Reporter on Thursday.\n\nDavid Livingston/Getty\n\nKailey Kaminsky, who worked on Carter Can in 2008, told THR in an interview that Oosterhouse, 41, had coerced her into performing repeated oral sex acts during the show\u2019s production. She claims she interpreted his requests as affecting her livelihood, which is why she agreed to a sexual relationship with him. The experiences allegedly led to her hospitalization for depression and her being let go from the show, she said.\n\nBut Oosterhouse denies his sexual relationship with Kaminsky as being nonconsensual, stating, \u201cIt was 100% mutual and consensual. In no way did I ever feel, nor was it ever indicated to me, that Kailey was uncomfortable during out intimate relationship. I would have never done anything that I was not sure was mutually agreeable.\u201d He also claimed Kaminsky initiated their relations the first time and \u201cthe 15 or so times we had relations thereafter.\u201d\n\nAmy Smart/Instagram\n\nIn her statement on Saturday, Smart reiterated Oosterhouse\u2019s point. \u201cWhen you are in a CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIP, then you need to take responsibility for engaging in that and not play victim,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIF a relationship does not work out the way you want it to, then sorry, but that is the risk you take when getting intimate with another person. There are plenty of relationships I wish I could go back and make different choices about, but it was on me to decide.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to take responsibility and learn from our mistakes and choices,\u201d she continued. \u201cWomen are powerful and we need to be reminded of the strength and power we hold and learn ways to take care of ourselves so we don\u2019t find ourselves saying yes when we really need to say no.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: ABC Has Pulled The Great American Baking Show Off the Air\n\nSmart said Kaminsky\u2019s claims were \u201cvery damaging and cruel to one of the most kindest, loving, non-aggressive men I have the privilege of knowing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so sorry for these salacious words being thrown around, they are extremely hurtful,\u201d she said, addressing the media. \u201cThis type of reporting needs to stop, it\u2019s so damaging for personal lives and careers and just not fair. Enough is enough, this is a plea to the writers, outlets and media\u2026 More due diligence needs to be done before crafting headlines and stories. Have discernment when you tell a story and please consider the source and story before just printing anything to get readers and viewers.\u201d\n\nShe ended her note, \u201c#lovethesetwo.\u201d\n\nOosterhouse told PEOPLE in a statement that he is \u201cvery passionate about what is happening right now with the #metoo movement, especially because I have so many strong women in my life, like my wife, mother, sister and of course my little baby girl. We are in a time of change for society and I am behind it 100%.\u201d\n\nHis latest TV project, ABC\u2019s The Great Christmas Light Fight, will air on the network on Monday as scheduled. He\u2019s served as a host and judge on the annual program since 2015, alongside fellow HGTV regular Taniya Nayak. The series, now in its fifth season, follows neighbors as they compete to decorate their homes with elaborate display of holiday lights and win a $50,000 prize.", "images":
