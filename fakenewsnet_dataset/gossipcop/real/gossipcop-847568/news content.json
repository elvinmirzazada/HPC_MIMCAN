The reality TV star's husband Kanye West opted against attending the event, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York on Monday night, meaning that Kim flew solo. She certainly didn't look lonely though, with friends and younger sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner among guests at the bash, themed around the work of Japanese designer Rei Kawakubo, who founded the label Comme des Garcons.\n\nKim Kardashian wore an off-the-shoulder Vivienne Westwood silk georgette slip dress\n\nWhile Kim made headlines for the silver Balmain gown she wore to last year's Met Gala, the 36-year-old went for a much more simple dress for the 2017 event, rocking a white off-the-shoulder Vivienne Westwood silk georgette slip dress with exaggerated bow at the waist.\n\nMet Gala 2017: The best moments\n\nKim completed the ensemble with strappy heels which showed off a fresh pedicure and dewy make-up, including a dramatic smoky eye and a little bronzer. The brunette beauty wore her tresses in a super sleek bob hairstyle, and did not wear any jewellery.\n\nThe mother-of-two attended this year's Met Gala without husband Kanye West\n\n\"Kim's look was inspired by both her classic Kim K look and a combination of Rei Kawakubo and the Commes des Garcons aesthetic,\" Kim's hairstylist Michael Silva for Toni & Guy told PopSugar. \"Rei was very well know for her hard and soft approach to design. With Kim's dress being so feminine and ethereal we decided to keep the hair strong and graphic. We liked that juxtaposition.\"\n\nThough the mother-of-two went the unexpected route for the event, Kim's siblings Kendall and Kylie pulled out all of the stops when it came to their outfits.\n\nMet Gala 2017: All the looks from fashion's biggest night\n\nKendall, 21, wore a sheer La Perla Haute Couture dress which left little to the imagination. The garment featured a deep neckline and body-baring skirt, with the model topping off her ensemble with black Christian Louboutin heels, a Tomasini bag and Lorraine Schwartz earrings.\n\nAnd Kylie, who went all out in a rose gold Versace gown which incorporated netting, tassels and glittering embellishment, was accompanied to the event by designer Donatella Versace.\n\nThe 19-year-old finished the look with Lorraine Schwartz jewellery and covered up her naturally brunette tresses with a striking bright blonde bob wig.\n\n\"When donatella wants you to go blonde .. you go [...] BLONDE,\" Kylie captioned a snap of her and Donatella at the bash on her Instagram page later in the night.", "images": ["https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/a86115d35f2b-best-xmas-jumpers-for-women.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/24a402c4c0d0-designer-bag-sale-edit-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/535c952ac975-longline-coats-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9fc8d17602ce-best-mens-valentines-day-gift-for-him-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/25c086e86a34-best-reiss-summer-sale.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/efffbeb673f5-kim-kardashian-met-gala-white-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/03459baa98d8-reformation-dress-edit.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/efffbeb673f5-kim-kardashian-met-gala-white-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/7b93637baab4-jubilee-outfits-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/53014dc4aa56-dd5cc02d9cf5-360d0c46f482-hello-logo.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/bf0cc516ed07-cyber-monday-deals-sales-discounts-t.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/efffbeb673f5-kim-kardashian-met-gala-white-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hello"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/fashion/news/2017050257136/kim-kardashian-goes-for-surprisingly-subdued-look-at-2017-met-gala/", "title": "Kim Kardashian goes for surprisingly subdued look at 2017 Met Gala", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "title": "Kim Kardashian goes for surprisingly subdued look at 2017 Met Gala | HELLO!", "description": "For this year's Met Gala Kim Kardashian rocked a white off-the-shoulder Vivienne Westwood silk georgette slip dress", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "plantilla": "Plantilla de noticias (plantilla-noticias.html)", "og": {"url": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/fashion/news/2017050257136/kim-kardashian-goes-for-surprisingly-subdued-look-at-2017-met-gala/", "title": "Kim Kardashian goes for surprisingly subdued look at 2017 Met Gala", "description": "For this year's Met Gala Kim Kardashian rocked a white off-the-shoulder Vivienne Westwood silk georgette slip dress", "updated_time": "2017-05-02T15:28:21.000Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/author/hello/"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/efffbeb673f5-kim-kardashian-met-gala-white-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "height": 675, "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "site_name": "HELLO!"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2017-05-02T15:28:21.000Z", "published_time": "2017-05-02T15:28:21.000Z", "section": "Trending Fashion", "tag": "Trending Fashion,Article,Kim Kardashian", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/hello/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 115281558857295, "pages": 89982930077, "admins": 89982930077}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@hellomag", "title": "Kim Kardashian goes for surprisingly subdued look at 2017 Met Gala", "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/efffbeb673f5-kim-kardashian-met-gala-white-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "description": "For this year's Met Gala Kim Kardashian rocked a white off-the-shoulder Vivienne Westwood silk georgette slip dress", "creator": "@hellomag", "url": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/fashion/news/2017050257136/kim-kardashian-goes-for-surprisingly-subdued-look-at-2017-met-gala/"}, "next-head-count": 36, "msapplication-TileColor": "#cc0000", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493738901.0, "source": "https://www.hellomagazine.com", "summary": ""}
