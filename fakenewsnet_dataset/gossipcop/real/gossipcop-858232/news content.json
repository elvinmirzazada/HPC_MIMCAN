The Shahs of Sunset clique will return this July to Bravo, and they are bringing along plenty of ups and downs to keep you on the edge of your seat. Asa Soltan Rahmati, Golnesa \u201cGG\u201d Gharachedaghi, Mercedes \u201cMJ\u201d Javid, Mike Shouhed, Reza Farahan, and Shervin Roohparvar are back for more. And, believe us, there's nothing this tight- knit group of friends are holding back from one another in Season 6.\n\nHow to Watch Catch up on Shahs of Sunset on the Bravo App.\n\nWe'll follow the squad as they face a lot of new changes in their lives. Asa will embark on her journey to motherhood. Mike is facing life after his split from Jessica Parido, though she still always seems to be at top of mind. MJ is prepping to spend her life with Tommy while also having to deal with the challenges of watching her father's health take a turn.\n\nRelated\n\nReza and Adam are taking life day by day during their first year of marriage as they continue to work out their own plans to start a family. Could it be that Shervin is finally ready to make things permanent with his long-distance girlfriend Annalise? Well their plans may get sidelined by rumors. And GG is taking back her life and her struggles with rheumatoid arthritis thanks to romance and a gig in a play in NYC.\n\nThe group will also head to Israel for what will probably be a life-changing experience. But, we'll let Reza sum up what is sure to be one crazy new season: \"I can't believe its been six years and I look this good.\"\n\nShahs of Sunset returns Sunday, July 16 at 8/7c.
