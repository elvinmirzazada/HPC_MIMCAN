It\u2019s a new Bravo show and SallyAnn Salsano (of Jersey Shore and Party Down South) is involved so I thought I would check it out because the Twitterverse is digging the \u201cgrown folks.\u201d I have a history of falling in love with shows that Bravo only produces for one season, rest in peace Work Out New York and especially Apres Ski, but I have higgghhh hopes for IoC! Rolling S1:E1 Tick Tick Boom after the break\n\nHere is the premise: Larry Sims has a bunch of disparate friend groups and he\u2019s decided to invite them ALL on vacation with him. This sounds like when I got married! I wish you all the best, Larry, you and your crew.\n\nLarry Sims!\n\nBianca Banks\n\nKamani Alana, Jermane Britton, Emily Moses\n\nAgu Ukaogo\n\nMalaku Quisada\n\nAnd we\u2019re off! We open in Los Angeles, where Larry is working on the set of Being Mary Jane and Gabrielle Union is there! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT WOMAN IS IN HER FORTIES??? Me neither! He\u2019s her celebrity hairstylist and she wants to know the last time he had a vacation? Like, never?\n\nGurl, you live in Los Angeles!! Every day is a vacation!\n\nHe tells her of his plan to bring all his friends and she warns him to be careful with his invite list (what fun would that be?), since people don\u2019t know each other they\u2019ll all be fighting to establish their preeminence with the person they do know: their BFF Larry. Or as Gabrielle Union puts it: his BFFFFFFFFF\n\nThis mansion is amazing!!! Dat infinity pool! Is there where Temptation Island was filmed? Asking for a friend who LOVED THAT SHOW.\n\nBianca is the first to arrive; oh. I thought she was his girlfriend from previews but she calls herself her bae, his cookie, his best friend but just friends. My bad. I also thought Larry was gay, but labels are so pre-Billions-season-2, aren\u2019t they?\n\nNext to arrive is Jermane, Larry\u2019s ride or die friend since he was 16, ALSO Larry\u2019s BFF. This is gonna be awesome! BFF Cagematch! Gayle and Oprah, ladies and gents\n\nKamani is the only friend Larry doesn\u2019t run at to hug; they danced together back a decade ago for Missy Elliot.\n\nShe\u2019s a recently divorced mom (hay gurl hay!), single and ready to be tingled. Bianca isn\u2019t digging this new addition, why is that? She should have been more threatened with Jermane-Ride-Or-Die\u2019s arrival for the BFF Cagematch, maybe she knows Kamani. Nope, she just jelly.\n\nNext guy we meet is Agu, Larry\u2019s wingman. He likes working out and looking good but most of all: being naked.\n\nThat\u2019s right, for the first time on Bravo, we have a pixellated bumhole\n\nHe\u2019s haaaawwwwwttttttttttttt, and not at the house yet, they have to wait for Emily\n\nMalaku is shouty at the hizzay, he and Larry were in a boyband!!\n\nAwww, they\u2019re so cute! He\u2019s besties with Jermane, too so at least he knows someone else there. Everyone is very excited to see him so he must rock.\n\nAnd now we meet Emily, the makeup artist half of their esthetics team\n\nThe party starts when she walks in, don\u2019t stop! Well it doesn\u2019t always start good, but it starts. She and Agu hit it off immediately; she\u2019s hoping he\u2019s gay because she has a serious boyfriend and doesn\u2019t need the temptation. For the record, Agu is haaaawwwwttttt\n\nMalaku is not excited to see Emily at all; last time he saw her she ripped a shirt off a man DURING a dinner party.\n\nEmily\u2019s our trailer trash in nice shoes, isn\u2019t she? You can say, just tell me! Oh, she\u2019s Australian, that\u2019s the accent I was just getting a piece of, do they have trailer parks in Oz?\n\nI love how Malku was totally mortified.\n\nHouse tour; now everybody has to choose rooms! But Larry\u2019s already done that, pairing Emily with Agu (that\u2019s it, now she\u2019s single too \u2013 Agu is haaawwwttttt), Kamani and Bianca (Kamani figures she\u2019s conceding enough sharing a HOUSE), Malaku with Jermane (no drama) and Larry by hisself?\n\nMalaku and Jermane discuss Emily in their room; he calls her a \u201ctick tick boom\u201d because you never know when she\u2019s going to go off. Emily\u2019s in her room unpacking with Agu, worried about losing \u201cthe beginning of the most successful relationship\u201d of her life and girl, you can\u2019t tell that at the BEGINNING! They all look like that to start!\n\nHer boyfriend Joseph is adorable\n\nBut you know, not haaaawwwt and sleeping in the same room. Plus she hasn\u2019t had sex for a whole three days\n\nSupper time! Emily is making guacamole but she\u2019s using the same fork to stir and she\u2019s using to taste. Jermane and I are taking a hard pass on the germy guac plus she keeps switching her sweaty hair around and you know that shit needs to be tied up during food prep.\n\nEveryone talks about how they know Larry at supper, then it\u2019s on to pool party and we getta stare at all the hot bawdies. I gotta give Bravo props, they give equal time to tiny swimsuit bottoms and Agu\u2019s abs.\n\nBianca swims over and plunks her bum down on Larry\u2019s crotch\n\nWho responds by laughing, which is not what you want when you do that. He gently guides her off his lap.\n\nLarry asks everyone what they would change about their bodies if they could; Agu said he\u2019d get a penis reduction because \u201cnot everybody can f*cking take it.\u201d Emily is getting increasingly worried about sharing a room with Agu The Tripod.\n\nEveryone gets out of the pool, Agu stripping down and running through the house naked because he forgot a towel.\n\nEmily asks Bianca to switch rooms with her; this is how she\u2019s messed up every single relationship she\u2019s had in the past. Plus, its been three whole days since she had sex, nobody could be expected to withstand that kind of temptation.\n\nLarry puts on the brakes, he\u2019s worried about diva Kamani and wrecking ball Emily being in the same room, but in the end allows it because he didn\u2019t come here to argue with his friends!\n\nAgu and Bianca chat back in their room, there is zero vibe there. Chemistry is funny, when you got it, you GOT it, when you don\u2019t: can\u2019t force it.\n\nBianca thinks it\u2019s just a matter of time until her and Larry hook it up; but she\u2019s ready to wait for him to make the move. She\u2019s not the aggressor. Sitting on his lap.\n\nHow can this woman spend this much time with someone she calls her best friend and not realise she\u2019s a hag?\n\nKamani comes down for dinner with her nipples out; Agu is ready to take her to Disneyland and pick up her drycleaning, it\u2019s ON.\n\nClub time! There\u2019s a stripper pole because of course there is and Emily\u2019s on it the whole time because of course she is, let Kamani have a turn! She gets up there and Agu jumps up and immediately takes his shirt off. He\u2019s liplicking, he\u2019s eye-humping, he is werqing this woman. The literally humping her knees was too far, though, back it up, back it up Agu. Kamani is intrigued but knows a player when she sees one, so she definitely has her guard up.\n\nJermane, Kamani and Malaku are confused by Larry kissing Bianca a bunch of times\n\nBut then he goes and dances with a bunch more women and Bianca starts to steeeamm. She feels completely disrespected. Kamani is watching this all; she knows how Bianca is feeling, she\u2019s been that girl before.\n\nI think I love Kamani just for that one little interview; who HASN\u2019T been that person trying to pretend that you don\u2019t care coz you can\u2019t care but you SO CARE?\n\nTime to go! Larry, Malku and Jermane go in one SUV, of course Agu rides with the ladies, including Emily who isn\u2019t wearing any panties and shows that to everyone along with her pole bruise because of course she does.\n\nEmily is grossssss, coughing all over the food, sitting on the couch with her cooter out and chewing on her nails between passing around pizza. That ain\u2019t right.\n\nThe next morning, Kamani calls her daughter while Agu talks about her with the guys. It seems he wasn\u2019t just spinning a line with that wanting to know about her family, etc, he\u2019s been out of relationships for a while and now he\u2019s interested in taking things a little deeper. He had the same problem Emily did in past relationships: couldn\u2019t keep it in his pants.\n\nBianca is all icy rage in the morning but to her credit she confronts Larry right away. He didn\u2019t realise that their relationship shifted for her when they kissed; he was just having fun in the moment. Sigh\n\nA lovely day in Cabo later, they\u2019re off to dinner in town. Where we find out that Emily is a dirty, dirty betch and not in a fun weekend away way. She\u2019s coughing on the food, double dipping again and now: chewing off her fake nails and putting them on the floor.\n\nCHEQUE PLEASE!!\n\nKamani calls her onnit; and yes, we\u2019re doing this, Emily. Nailgate ensues while Larry tells us he felt the same way about Emily when he met her, but he came around to see she\u2019s a really sweet person and he hopes his friends do too. They\u2019re too busy counting how many French tips are on the floor to see the \u201creal\u201d her right now.\n\nKamani\u2019s had enough; she\u2019s disgusted with Emily, who she thinks is pulling down Larry\u2019s cachet by being a dirtbag. She\u2019s owt and not far behind her is Emily, who won\u2019t be talked to like that! We\u2019re done\n\nSo. What didja think? I like Larry, Jermane and Malaku, course, but Agu is not hard to look at either. I have just a tetch of affection for Kamani, mostly because picking your nails off at the table IS nasty but also Emily. I think she\u2019s sweet. I also think she drinks too much and trades on this \u201cfun\u201d persona more heavily than she should, but haven\u2019t we all? I can even relate to Bianca, who seems just a little too old to be playing middle school rules games with Larry but we all get there when we get there, amirite?\n\nLarry is adorable, I love how the women are all: HE HAS STYLE AND CAN DO MY HAIR IN THE MORNING!! He must have had quite the life; boybands, dancing for Missy Elliot, now a celeb hairstylist? Woot!\n\nUntil next time!", "images": ["https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.40.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/icons_theme/default/default_rss.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/share_icons/Twitter_Follow/en_US_Follow.svg", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2_35.gif", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/share_icons/fb_icons/en_US.svg", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/12_37.gif", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/29_07.gif", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/4_20.gif", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/9.18.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-TALKING-SHITE-2-32x32.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.23.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/038e5442cf45a851bb6509d4179e4de7?s=64&d=wavatar&r=pg", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/21_38.gif", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/10_27.gif", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/visit_icons/Visit_us_fb/icon_Visit_us_en_US.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/7.53.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/icons_theme/default/default_twitter.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/6.40.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/19_23.gif", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/close.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/icons_theme/default/default_instagram.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.32.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/15.20.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/share_icons/Twitter_Tweet/en_US_Tweet.svg", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/visit_icons/Visit_us_twitter/icon_Visit_us_en_US.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/12_49.gif", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.36.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/icons_theme/default/default_email.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/9.47.png", "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/plugins/ultimate-social-media-icons/images/icons_theme/default/default_facebook.png"], "top_img": "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-TALKING-SHITE-2-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["View All Posts"], "canonical_link": "https://gingesbecray.com/invite-only-cabo-s1e1-tick-tick-boom-recap/", "title": "Invite Only Cabo S1:E1 Tick Tick Boom Recap \u2013 Ginges Be Cray", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.114.0", "follow.it-verification-code-cTJDV1QvTEova0ZTYkFUbFpRUTN4SXphZDJ6QnJZR0YzbnMrdE0rNFlsWmsvSncwdXQ4ZVhwWDB2Q3R3ZzRMRE1IeVhpQXdkcGNNSnV1S3BBd3AxaWt4elN1VWJLV2xTR29LckE3T2RxUnF6UkdwMzN4cjZaQ0xETUtGalZ4emF8REhnWTNOaFg1VlJyalYrUkUxZzU1K1BLUlVBcHM1MXloSUM4UWZTblJmTT0=": "FHfFT0vFwZvnSSdH6xs8", "google-site-verification": "eMdC3X37kbLZ55vCTohIPjTvKBeZAQnWDAmbZzWcPHM", "google-adsense-platform-account": "ca-host-pub-2644536267352236", "google-adsense-platform-domain": "sitekit.withgoogle.com", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://gingesbecray.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-TALKING-SHITE-2-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://gingesbecray.com", "summary": ""}
