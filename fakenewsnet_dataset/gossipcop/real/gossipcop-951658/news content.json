Luann was also required to \u201cfund the trust with an undivided one-half interest in and to the Marital Residence,\u201d according to the documents.\n\nNow, Alexandre, Victoria and Noel are claiming Luann \u201cnever created\u201d the trust and instead sold the residence in November 2014 for $8 million and used the earnings to purchase a home in Southampton, New York for $3.1 million.\n\nAccording to the settlement, if the marital home was sold, \u201cthe entire net proceeds of the sale may at any time prior to the termination of the Trust, be reinvested by [Luann] to purchase another residence, provided that the children shall continue to be the owners, in Trust, of an undivided one-half interest in said property.\u201d\n\nBut the documents allege that Luann \u201chas never, since her purchase of the Premises, created the Trust or conveyed to her children, in Trust, an undivided one-half interest in the Premises.\u201d\n\nAccording to the documents, Luann has threatened to sell her home \u201cfor more than fifty percent its present value and leave Suffolk County with the proceeds \u2026 so that she may purchase, for herself alone, a luxury home in upstate New York.\u201d\n\nAlexandre, Victoria and Noel are seeking for Luann to abide by the judgment and to prevent her from listing or selling the home.\n\nA rep for de Lesseps did not respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.", "images":
