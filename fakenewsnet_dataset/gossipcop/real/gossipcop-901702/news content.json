They were spotted kissing in New York in October 2016, but went on to split up in November 2017. Having spent just over a year together, the actress and director remained friends, and have been spotted together on several occasions since.\n\n\n\nPhotographed looking very much like a couple, Lawrence and Aronofsky reunited in Brooklyn last night for the BAM Gala 2018 honoring Darren Aronofsky, Jeremy Irons, and Nora Ann Wallace. Posing at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal together, the actress and director had their arms around each other, and didn't look unhappy to see one another at all.\n\nLawrence wore a flawless Olivier Theyskens dress to the event, as she posed with her ex, or maybe not ex, boyfriend:\n\nGetty Images\n\nAs E! reported in December 2017, Lawrence and Aronofsky were still spending time together following their break-up, with a source revealing:\n\n\"They are friends. They are not officially back together but are spending time together again. They never stopped speaking after they broke up. They care about each other. They are just seeing what happens.\"\n\nThe couple's age gap\u2014Lawrence is 27 and Aronofsky is 49\u2014has always been a talking point in reports about their relationship, but it's clear that they have a connection.\n\nWhether or not Lawrence is actually dating Aronofsky again has yet to be confirmed, but the prospect seems more than possible.\n\nRelated Story Jennifer Lawrence Talks Dating
