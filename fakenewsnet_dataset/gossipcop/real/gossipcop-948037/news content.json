Photo: Santiago Felipe/Getty Images\n\nYour fav could never intentionally hurt a living creature, but a failed onstage stunt now has Drag Race season ten queen Asia O\u2019Hara apologizing for the fate of a number of butterflies. O\u2019Hara, who was one of the show\u2019s four finalists headed into Friday night\u2019s finale, had planned to release the insects from her costume during her final lip sync for her life. Unfortunately, the butterflies never took flight. \u201cDespite months of research and rehearsing with a professional company, what I hoped would be an amazing and safe display of optimism, and a surprise for everyone including production and the network, it did not go as planned,\u201d O\u2019Hara said in a statement posted to Twitter. \u201cI would like to publicly offer the entire world my deepest apology. It\u2019s important that everyone knows I would never purposely hurt any living being and have the utmost respect for all animals.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, O\u2019Hara says she suspects the butterflies\u2019 failure to launch was the result of their climate-controlled shipping conditions. \u201cThey need to warm up to a certain temperature in order to fly away,\u201d she explained. \u201cI, of course, rehearsed it at home several times and it worked, but [the finale was] a different place and a different environment, and I don\u2019t think the contraptions were warm enough to wake the butterflies up. But, as they warmed up in the stage lights during the break, they started to fly away!\u201d In addition to her apology, O\u2019Hara promises to donate over 100 volunteer hours to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.", "images": ["https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/08f/83c/984b1e36a36cf2b7d15194b8d8ceeceece-rtlb-lede-lesley-manville.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fc3/7b3/cbe5c1610a9c2873cc6ab7ab416c898fb6-Role-Call-Mekhi-Phifer-8-mile.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1a0/826/64151a41870df0ea030306089faadb3607-28-Asia-OHara.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1a0/826/64151a41870df0ea030306089faadb3607-28-Asia-OHara.rsquare.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/432/78a/817556d5a1a5ab358af1dca2d79eccaaae-Le-French-Diner-Matt-Morris.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2e2/98e/99818d3d7a6a16d9c4b41dca7a9760ec10-2423Cov-4x5-CONFLICT.w240.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1a0/826/64151a41870df0ea030306089faadb3607-28-Asia-OHara.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/asia-ohara-apologizes-for-failed-drag-race-butterfly-stunt.html", "title": "Asia O\u2019Hara Apologizes for Failed Drag Race Finale Butterfly Stunt", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "asia o\u2019hara, rupaul\u2019s drag race, stunts, rupaul\u2019s drag race season 10, apologies, tv, drag, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Asia O\u2019Hara Apologizes for Failed Drag Race Finale Butterfly Stunt", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/asia-ohara-apologizes-for-failed-drag-race-butterfly-stunt.html", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s important that everyone knows I would never purposely hurt any living being and have the utmost respect for all animals.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1a0/826/64151a41870df0ea030306089faadb3607-28-Asia-OHara.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Asia O\u2019Hara Apologizes for Failed Drag Race Butterfly Stunt", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s important that everyone knows I would never purposely hurt any living being and have the utmost respect for all animals.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1a0/826/64151a41870df0ea030306089faadb3607-28-Asia-OHara.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hallekiefer", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-28T23:02:42.993-04:00", "tag": "asia o'hara, rupaul's drag race, stunts, rupaul's drag race season 10, apologies, tv, drag", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Drag queen Asia O\u2019Hara apologizes for a failed butterfly-release stunt she attempted during the season ten \u2018Drag Race\u2019 finale.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "asia o'hara, rupaul's drag race, stunts, rupaul's drag race season 10, apologies, tv, drag", "author": "Halle Kiefer", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "sectionOverride": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.vulture.com/media/sites/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530241362.993, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
