But as she recently explained, after her second birth she was not in a good place.\n\nAs the Oscar-winning actress explained to her mother, fellow actress Blythe Danner in a recent Goop podcast called \"Gwyneth x Blythe: On Mothers and Daughters,\" she was truly in a \"dark place\" after the birth of her second child, Moses, 12 years ago.\n\n\"I think (it) was really shocking to me because I never thought that I would be a person who got postnatal depression,\" the 45-year-old explained.\n\nPaltrow and ex-Chris Martin are the parents to Moses and Apple, 13.\n\nAnd Apple's birth was so delightful, she recalled, that the postpartum took her by surprise.\n\nHappy birthday, mama \u2764\ufe0f A post shared by Gwyneth Paltrow (@gwynethpaltrow) on Feb 3, 2018 at 7:11pm PST\n\n\"I was so euphoric when Apple was born, and I assumed it would happen with Mosey and it just ... it took a while,\" she said. \"I really went into a dark place.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Paltrow has discussed her postpartum depression; in 2015 she told Entertainment Tonight, \"(My case) was low-grade enough that I didn't have to be hospitalized, but it's a very debilitating thing, and I think there's so much shame around it and there shouldn't be.\"\n\nIn 2011 she told Good Housekeeping that after her son's birth, \"I felt like a zombie. I couldn't access my heart. I couldn't access my emotions. I couldn't connect ... With (Apple), I was on cloud nine. I couldn't believe it wasn't the same. I just thought it meant I was a terrible mother and a terrible person.\"\n\nMartin was the one who called her attention to her changed attitude, and \"that sort of burst the bubble,\" said Paltrow.\n\nClosed Captioning ON OFF apply | reset x Text Display\n\nBackground\n\nEnhancements font\n\nTimes New Roman Arial Comic Sans\n\nT T T T size\n\n\n\ncolor share link Gwyneth Paltrow: 'I have @#$%ed up so many relationships' Play Video - 0:42 Gwyneth Paltrow: 'I have @#$%ed up so many relationships' Play Video - 0:42\n\nThese days, she's fully recovered and engaged to producer Brad Falchuk.\n\n\"I thought postpartum depression meant you were sobbing every single day and incapable of looking after a child,\" she said in 2011. \"But there are different shades of it and depths of it, which is why I think it's so important for women to talk about it. It was a trying time.
