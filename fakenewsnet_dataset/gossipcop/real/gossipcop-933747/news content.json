Although the inquiry absolved network leaders, NBC also faced concerns \u2014 including from Mr. Lauer\u2019s former \u201cToday\u201d show co-anchor, Ann Curry \u2014 about how thoroughly it had investigated itself.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence indicating that any NBC News or \u2018Today\u2019 show leadership, News H.R. or others in positions of authority in the News Division received any complaints about Lauer\u2019s workplace behavior prior to Nov. 27, 2017,\u201d the report concluded. In the wake of Mr. Lauer\u2019s ouster, there had been questions about what executives at the network knew about their star\u2019s behavior.\n\nBut unlike other news organizations, like Fox News and NPR, that have dealt with workplace misbehavior, NBC News opted not to have an outside legal firm conduct its review. The investigation was overseen by Kimberley D. Harris, the general counsel of NBCUniversal.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/business/nbc-1/nbc-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=87b7a9b2d25e64ff6636b8a3cbc3667b6f49cfb2a2db5d8064b9d202e16eca7d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/business/nbc-1/nbc-1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/business/nbc-1/nbc-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=87b7a9b2d25e64ff6636b8a3cbc3667b6f49cfb2a2db5d8064b9d202e16eca7d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael M.
