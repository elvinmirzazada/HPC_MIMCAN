Both have said they still love each other over the past year, and Garfield during award season was especially verbose in his praise of Stone's work.\n\n\"I'll speak for myself: You know, I'm her biggest fan as an artist,\" he told Vanity Fair in January. \"I'm constantly inspired by her work. I'm constantly inspired by how she handles and holds herself. So for me, I've\u2014it's been bliss to be able to watch her success and watch her bloom into the actress that she is. And it's also been wonderful to have that kind of support for each other. It's nothing but a beautiful thing.\"\n\nAnd that beautiful thing is very much continuing today (even if Stone may be rumored to be quietly dating someone else). At a premiere last night, Garfield ended up gushing about Stone when E! asked Garfield if he had seen Stone's film Battle of the Sexes. \"I haven't [seen the movie] but I'm very excited to,\" he started. The reporter then asked if there was any friendly competition between the two, as they both have films out (Breathe for Garfield). \"Oh my god, no, don't be silly,\" he immediately dismissed. \"I'm nothing but supportive and her biggest fan.\"\n\nStone and her biggest fan boy may be able to see each other a little more easily in the coming months. Angels in America, Garfield's last theater project in London, will be doing a New York City Broadway run that he'll be participating in, starting in February (though rehearsals could begin well before). Stone has been in New York City recently shooting her Netflix series Maniac.", "images":
