Although times are (slowly) changing, a pair of trousers on a young boy is considered quite middle class\u2013quite suburban. And no self-respecting aristo or royal would want to be considered suburban.\u201d\n\nPrince George waves to the public and media as he visits the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital to meet his little sister for the first time. A photo posted by Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on May 2, 2015 at 12:27pm PDT\n\nMost boys graduate to full-length trousers at about 8 years old, Hanson explained. He said the shorts-only tradition may stem from the antiquated custom of \u201cbreeching,\u201d which dates back centuries in the U.K.\n\nRELATED: Watch Princess Charlotte, Prince George play with balloons, bubbles during party\n\nTraditionally, he said, young British boys were dressed in gowns for the first few years of their lives, until being \u201cbreeched\u201d and graduating to short trousers.\n\nMATT PORTEOUS / PA Prince George, who celebrates his third birthday on July 22, balances on a wooden swing.
