From the strapless Marchesa gown she wore for the ceremony to the dreamy, sheer number she rocked at the reception, the bride looked utterly magical. And can we talk about her hair?\n\nThe couple has already enjoyed an epic honeymoon, and we still can\u2019t stop thinking about her bridal \u2018do.\n\nAs it turns out, Hough\u2019s lighter locks were actually inspired by a childhood photo seen by the woman responsible for her baby blonde highlights: Her pal and hairstylist, Riawna Capri from Nine Zero One Salon in Los Angeles. The strand whisperer \u2014 who also tends the tresses of Kristin Cavallari, Nina Dobrev and Sarah Hyland \u2014 shared the details of Hough\u2019s hue transformation via Instagram (click right for more photos).\n\nWhat struck us most is that even after all that bleach the 28-year-old\u2019s strands looked more gorgeous than ever. Not a hint of damage in sight.\n\nHow is that even possible? Capri said she used Joico Blonde Life Brightening Shampoo ($17) \u2014 along with the matching conditioner ($18) and luster lock ($20). \"(It) really brought the health and shine back into her hair,\u201d she told the site Byrdie.\n\nWant to achieve Hough\u2019s enviably lustrous locks?
