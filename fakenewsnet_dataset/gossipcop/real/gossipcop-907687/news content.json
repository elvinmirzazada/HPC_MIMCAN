But of course now is the time for listening, and that\u2019s what we are all trying to do.\u201d\n\nFive women accused Franco, who is nominated at Sunday\u2019s ceremony for outstanding performance by a male actor in a leading role for his movie The Disaster Artist, of sexually exploitative behavior earlier this month.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: See the Standout Outfits from the SAG Awards 2018\n\nLast week, Franco skipped the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards, where he won the award for best actor in a comedy. Sources have said the actor has been shaken by the allegations: \u201cHe\u2019s in a really bad place,\u201d a source close to the situation told PEOPLE. \u201cHis close friends are trying to be there for him.\u201d\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Franco addressed the allegations made by a number of women on Twitter after he wore a Time\u2019s Up pin at the Golden Globe Awards.\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page.

Two students claimed the actor would often become angry on set when they would refuse to film topless, while another former acting student at the film school Franco founded said he once removed safety guards while filming an oral sex scene on the set of the 2015 film The Long Home.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: James Franco Accused of Inappropriate Behavior By Five Women\n\nAdditionally, actress Violet Paley recounted her previous social media claims that Franco exposed himself and tried to pressure her into oral sex. Though she said they had a consensual relationship, Paley said, \u201cthat time wasn\u2019t consensual.\u201d She also alleged that he told her friend to meet him in a hotel when the friend was 17.\n\nCatch PEOPLE, Entertainment Weekly and TNT\u2019s official LIVE red carpet show ahead of the SAG Awards on PeopleTV starting at 5:30 p.m. ET on Sunday.

The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate. But I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn\u2019t have a voice for so long. So I don\u2019t want to shut them down in any way.\u201d\n\nThe 24th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards are broadcast live from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on both TNT and TBS starting at 8 p.m. ET.", "images":
