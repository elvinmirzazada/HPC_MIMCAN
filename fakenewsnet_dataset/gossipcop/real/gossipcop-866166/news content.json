And it only took 12 years!\n\nWhile mostly it\u2019s funny to think of either Simpson or Lachey as relevant these days, a producer of the long gone MTV series is going around exposing secrets. She certainly bided her time!\n\nSue Kolinsky, who worked on the series all three seasons, dished some behind-the-scene secrets to Complex and basically, she maybe thinks Simpson wasn\u2019t just acting like a dumb blonde.\n\n\u201cThere were times when we were like, \u2018Hm, does she really not know what this means?'\u201d Kolinsky said. \u201cI truly believe the whole \u2018chicken & fish\u2018 situation was accurate. She really did not know. I remember there was a scene where there was a dead mouse by their pool and it had been dead for a while. Nick said, \u2018it\u2019s in rigor mortis\u2019 and Jessica said, \u2018Riga-what?\u2019 I truly believe she didn\u2019t know what that meant.\u201d Oh, Jessica. You sweet summer child.\n\n\u201cIt was a whole new genre,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhen it comes to reality TV, back then it was at its purest form. Plus, [Nick and Jessica] were perfect because they were polar opposites, they were beautiful and without even realizing it, they were very funny.\u201d\n\nUltimately, though, Kolinsky thinks that the pair split after three seasons because they were completely different.\n\n\u201cHe was frugal, and she had excessive taste. In the end they weren\u2019t suited for each other. The only thing they really had in common was their music. She was really young; I think he\u2019s seven years older than her. He wanted a family, and her father thought maybe she was too young. Her father was very involved in her life.\u201d\n\nGross. Of course Papa Joe was overly involved. What a mess.\n\nAnyway, the two have probably forgotten they were ever even married to each other, so we can go back to pretending \u201cThe Newlyweds\u201d never even existed.", "images":
