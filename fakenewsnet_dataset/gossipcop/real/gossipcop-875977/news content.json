Then and Now\n\n\"Look What You Made Me Do\" made its debut in full at the MTV VMAs, amid lots of buzz from fans (...and haters).\n\nTaylor Swift's New Video Proves She Officially Gives Zero Effs, Director Shuts Down Beyonc\u00e9 Comparisons\n\nTaylor Swift is ready to defend her reputation \u2014 well, at least her \"Look at What You Made Me Do\" director is from those who say she may have copied Beyonc\u00e9 for the music video. But, first let's get to that buzzy clip.\n\nOn Sunday August 27, Taylor dropped the full-length version at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, and it's a glittering, self-aware visual that tears down everything fans think they know about Taylor Swift while poking fun at every, single thing you've ever poked fun of her about, from always being surprised at award shows, to public perception that she's always playing the victim. Taylor acknowledges \u2014 and makes fun of herself for \u2014 every one of those things during the eye-popping video by bringing back to life all of her personas. Of course, this includes Taylor from the 2009 VMAs AKA the night that Kanye West bum rushed the stage. (Oh, you remember it.)\n\nRelated\n\nSince Taylor dropped \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" which is probably about her beef with Kim and Kanye, there have been very mixed reactions from fans and haters alike.\n\ni don't think there's been a piece of comedy in the last ten years that is funnier than taylor swift's new single and edgy rebrand pic.twitter.com/Wk41n7iVKE \u2014 demi adejuyigbe (@electrolemon) August 25, 2017\n\n\"the old taylor is dead\" that's why she deleted all her social media. she's going through her emo phase #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo pic.twitter.com/jWokQl9qub \u2014 Marcus (@MartianMarcus) August 25, 2017\n\nDon't say she didn't, say she didn't warn ya#LookWhatYouMadeMeDo pic.twitter.com/RrAbAnxiAF \u2014 10 GRAMMYS \u00e2\u009c\u00a8 (@Swiftness13) August 25, 2017\n\n\"Good morning, could I please speak to the old Taylor?\" pic.twitter.com/ng3AtTnDWa \u2014 Ash Crossan (@AshCrossan) August 25, 2017\n\nAhead of the video's premiere, the Internet was already making noise, with many buzzing that the teaser shot (which features Taylor fiercely standing in front of spandex-clad dancers) resembled a similar shot from Beyonce's \"Formation\" music video and Lemonade era.\n\nLiving Single vs Friends pic.twitter.com/LDIhJih0PT \u2014 Astead W. Herndon (@AsteadWH) August 25, 2017\n\nWhen you order something online VS When it arrives #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo #LWYMMDvideo pic.twitter.com/cq9FUPrcYa \u2014 La 5\u00c2\u00b0 Fifth Harmony (@thedodo__) August 25, 2017\n\nHowever, director Joseph Kahn (who has worked with Taylor in the past, as well as Beyonc\u00e9, Britney Spears, and, like, all your favorite pop stars during his career), shut down that chatter on Twitter ahead of the video's premiere.\n\nI've worked with Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 a few times. She's an amazing person. The #LWYMMDvideo is not in her art space. Love and respect to Bey. \u2014 Joseph Kahn (@JosephKahn) August 26, 2017\n\nAlso there's something to that \"formation\" shot I painted out and you haven't seen yet. Stay tuned Sunday :)#LWYMMDvideo#SneakyAsian \u2014 Joseph Kahn (@JosephKahn) August 26, 2017", "images":
