The 25-song double album features the singles God's Plan, Nice for What and I'm Upset, and is currently available to stream and download.\n\nScorpion includes a posthumous appearance from Michael Jackson, with an old recording of the King of Pop summoned from the archives and deployed on the song Don't Matter To Me. Elsewhere, Talk Up incorporates a verse from Jay-Z, while After Dark features Ty Dolla $ign and Static Major, a singer and producer who died in 2008.\n\nDrake also appears to confirm rumours that he secretly fathered a son. The Toronto star has recently been involved in a feud with rapper Pusha T who last month released The Story of Adidon, a song that accused of Drake fathering and hiding a child.\n\n\"I wasn't hiding my kid from the world,\" Drake raps on Emotionless, which features a prominent Mariah Carey sample. \"I was hiding the world from my kid.\"\n\nREAD MORE\n\nElsewhere, March 14 appears to be dedicated to Drake's son while obliquely covering the circumstances of his birth and his relationship with child's mother. \"Shit, we only met two times,\" raps Drake on a song that again sees him echo Michael Jackson: \"She not my lover like Billie Jean, but the kid is mine.\"\n\nHe also appears to address his son directly: \u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about whose house you live at/ Or who loves you more, or who\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nDrake may have also drawn a line under the beef with Pusha, a feud the Canadian is widely regarded to have lost. \"You know a wise man once said nothin' at all,\" he raps on Emotionless.", "images":
