It was, at least according to POTUS. The President claimed that he had been called by the magazine to inform him that he would \"probably\" receive the widely-respected honor which would come with certain condition, but he said that he had passed on it.\n\n\"Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named 'Man (Person) of the Year,' like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot,\" so he wrote on Twitter on Friday, November 24. \"I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!\"\n\nTime Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named \u201cMan (Person) of the Year,\u201d like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2017\n\nTime quickly disputed Trump's claim. Taking to its own Twitter account, the magazine stated, \"The president is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year. Time does not comment on our choice until publication, which is December 6.\"\n\nThe President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year. TIME does not comment on our choice until publication, which is December 6. \u2014 TIME (@TIME) November 25, 2017\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski then fired back at the magazine, telling Fox News, \"The mainstream media has never wanted to give this president the credit that he's deserved. I don't know who else can be the Time magazine person of the year other than our president, Donald Trump. This president calls out the media when they're dishonest, and that's why the American people love him.\"\n\nMeanwhile, anti-Trump supporters won't miss the chance to mock the President. Among those were celebrities like Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Mark Hamill and Lance Bass, who each claimed to have been offered similar title under different conditions.\n\n\"Veep\" star Louis-Dreyfus tweeted, \".@nytimes just called to say I was PROBABLY going to be named comedienne of the year but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway! @andy_murray.\"\n\n.@nytimes just called to say I was PROBABLY going to be named comedienne of the year but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot.

We hooked up a few times, which was fun. But, ultimately, it didn't seem like an ideal match. It's too bad though because Time Magazine is really hot. Oh well.
