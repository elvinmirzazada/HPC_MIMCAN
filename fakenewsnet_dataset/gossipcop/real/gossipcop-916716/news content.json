And it almost drives me crazy, because I start to believe them. I don\u2019t have no proof. I don\u2019t have receipts. But I just got to know my man,\u201d the rapper, who turns 26 on Thursday, said in her new W Magazine cover story.\n\n\u201cWe practically on the phone 24 hours a day. If I can\u2019t find him, I\u2019m going to find his friend. Somebody going to answer the phone,\u201d Cardi (real name: Belcalis Almanzar) said of her marriage, adding she tries not to listen to the negativity: \u201cBut I cannot be feeling insecure, to a point that I would drive my dude away, because these people want that to happen.\u201d\n\nJeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\nCardi, who rose to stardom last year with her breakout hit \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d also said that living in the spotlight has added pressure to her relationship with 26-year-old Migos rapper Offset (aka Kiari Cephus).\n\nThe pair \u2014 who share 3-month-old daughter Kulture Kiari \u2014 married quietly last September in a secret ceremony. But Cardi admitted she was unsure of their relationship even then.\n\n\u201cWhen I got married with my dude, we still had a lot of doubts, because our relationship is not like everybody\u2019s,\u201d she said of Offset, who also has three kids from three previous relationships. \u201cHe was always traveling, and I was always traveling. We\u2019re artists. So I used to see him, like, twice a week, and, you know, he\u2019s known for having different women, and I\u2019m known for, like, not taking s\u2014 from guys. But we really loved each other, and we was scared to lose each other.\u201d\n\nCardi B and Offset. John Parra/Telemundo/NBCU Photo Bank\n\nDespite all the drama, Cardi said she has changed the way she approaches her art with her husband\u2019s feelings in mind.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t rap about certain things, because I don\u2019t want to insult my husband. And when I want to do a music video, I can\u2019t use a male model and do crazy things,\u201d she said, adding Offset has changed his creative process as well: \u201cHe knows better than to do certain things in music videos. I\u2019ll beat his ass.\u201d\n\nBarely four months after their private wedding, reports surfaced that Offset had a sex tape with another woman.\n\nMatt Baron/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not right for a [n\u2014a] to cheat\u2026But what you want me to do?\u201d Cardi wrote on Twitter in January, alluding to Offset\u2019s alleged affair. \u201cGo f\u2014k me another n\u2014a? Start all over again and get cheated on again? This s\u2014 happens to everyone and I be too, you too\u2026People handle they relationship different soo.\u201d\n\nCardi went on to seemingly address Offset\u2019s alleged infidelity in her Invasion of Privacy single \u201cBe Careful,\u201d in which she spits the lyrics: \u201cI could\u2019ve did what you did to me to you a few times. \u2026 But that\u2019s not my M.O., I\u2019m not that type of bitch. And karma for you is gon\u2019 be who you end up with.\u201d\n\nLast week, Cardi surrendered to police and was arrested then charged with one count of assault and two counts of reckless endangerment.\n\nAccording to the New York Times and TMZ, the charges stem from an incident that occurred in August, when two bartenders at Angel\u2019s Strip Club in N.Y.C. claimed that Cardi ordered an attack on the women because she believed Offset had had an affair with one of them.", "images":
