We are so thankful the Lord has brought us to this place and we can\u2019t wait to begin our journey as husband and wife!\u201d\n\nFor their special day, the bride chose a wedding gown from The White Dress Boutique, while her eight bridesmaids wore blush-colored dresses handmade by Jana Duggar and Josh Duggar\u2019s wife Anna.\n\nAndy Henderson Photography/duggarfamily.com\n\nThe ceremony was officiated by Lauren\u2019s father Dwain Swanson, and the romantic theme incorporated flowers, wood and iron. For their wedding colors, the couple chose a combination of grey and blue, pink and olive, plus green and white.\n\nAt the reception, guests enjoyed cupcakes, a candy bar and a strawberry shortcake-flavored, heart-shaped wedding cake.\n\nBefore saying \u201cI do,\u201d the pair hosted a \u201csummer-style\u201d indoor cookout rehearsal dinner with burgers, hot dogs and sides on the menu.\n\nThe newlyweds first announced they were courting in January and got engaged just two months later.\n\n\u201cWe are overjoyed to begin this new phase of our lives together,\u201d Josiah told PEOPLE in January. \u201cThrough the years our families\u2019 friendship has allowed us to get to know one another as friends.
