Perspective and life experience is everything,\u201d Parker remarked. \u201cI think the value of being a sophisticated woman and choosing marriage is promising, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAgreeing, Paltrow commented on how difficult it is to choose the right partner when you get married at a young age. \u201cIt\u2019s such a crazy game of chance because who knows if you\u2019re going to grow in parallel, if your paths are going to diverge, [or] what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she said.\n\nSplash News\n\nPaltrow and Falchuk first met in 2010 when she made a guest appearance on Glee as Holly Holliday, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. The two officially started dating in the summer of 2014 and confirmed their engagement in January in Goop Magazine\u2018s Sex & Love issue.\n\nWhile details about her upcoming nuptials remain unknown, the pair are set to tie the knot later this year.\n\nShe previously married the Coldplay frontman in 2003, before announcing they were \u201cconsciously uncoupling\u201d in March 2014. The amicable exes share daughter Apple, 14, and son Moses, 12.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Gwyneth Paltrow Is \u2018Excited\u2019 to Start Wedding Planning: \u2018I Feel Like a 21-Year-Old!\u2019\n\nPaltrow went on to ask Parker, who has been married to Matthew Broderick since 1997, if she had any insight on \u201cthe things that keep people growing together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Parker replied, adding that something she\u2019s noticed recently is that while there are always going to be things about your partner that irritate you, getting upset about the small things doesn\u2019t really matter in the long run.\n\n\u201cYeah it bothers me,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut I also try to remember or think of how many things I do that must really bother him.\u201d\n\nDia Dipasupil/Getty\n\nPaltrow went on to add that as she gets older, she\u2019s come to view intimate relationships as \u201ca study into everything that\u2019s wrong with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can sort of convince yourself, \u2018Uh, this person is irritating,\u2019 but it\u2019s like, \u2018Why is that triggering? What am I projecting?
