The second part of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy will be showing for one week in four theaters on Friday, Aug. 24, and will be screened in IMAX 70mm.\n\nThe movie has been a commercial and critical success in all aspects when it first came out in 2008. As the first superhero movie to gross more than $1 billion box office sales, \"The Dark Knight\" has provided the template against which superhero movies have since been measured by, as Forbes pointed out.\n\nThe movie is currently considered the 35th highest grossing movie, in all categories, of all time, as well.\n\nChief among its many highlights is the brilliant performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker, a tremendous portrayal that has earned the actor a posthumous Oscar award for Best Supporting Actor, and a turn at the character that has set the bar since.\n\nAside from the acting and direction, \"The Dark Knight\" was also a breakthrough in technical filmmaking, being the first mainstream movie shot using IMAX cameras and the first feature-length release, at more than two and a half hours long, to have used IMAX Digital Media Remastering technology.\n\nThat means this year's screening of \"The Dark Knight\" can be shown in full IMAX 70mm quality as the movie returns in four venues by next month.\n\nThe movie will be shown for one week starting Aug. 24 in the AMC Universal Citywalk IMAX in Universal City California, AMC Lincoln Square IMAX in New York City, AMC Metreon IMAX in San Francisco and Ontario Place Cinesphere IMAX in Toronto, as listed out by Entertainment Weekly.\n\nEach venue will screen the 10th-anniversary re-release in IMAX and will be limited to one daily screening for now.", "images": ["https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/13/18/131819_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/14/90/149010_a_66_66.jpg",
