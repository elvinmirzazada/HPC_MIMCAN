I never heard any stories like this \u2014 I never heard anything specific \u2014 but it\u2019s devastating to hear,\u201d the Gossip Girl alum, 30, told The Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday, October 11. \u201cThe No. 1 thing that can happen is that people who share their stories, people have to listen to them and trust them, and people have to take it seriously.\u201d\n\nThe Green Lantern actress added: \u201cAs important as it is to remain furious about this, it\u2019s important to also say that this exists everywhere so remember to look everywhere. This isn\u2019t a single incident. This cannot happen, this should not happen, and it happens in ever single industry.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebs Fight Back on Twitter!

It\u2019s important that there is an uprising. It\u2019s important that we don\u2019t stand for this and that we don\u2019t focus on one or two or three or four stories, it\u2019s important that we focus on humanity in general and say, \u2018This is unacceptable.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars Who Were Fired From Jobs From fast food to newspaper delivery, find out what gigs the stars loathed\n\nAs previously reported, 65-year-old Weinstein was fired from his own company amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault made against him.
