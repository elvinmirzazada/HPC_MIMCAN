A source told Us, however, that the sister-in-laws were not in a fight. \u201cThe \u2018feud\u2019 is definitely being played up. Are they the best of friends? No. Do they speak every waking second? No. Do they hate each other? Absolutely not,\u201d the source explained.\n\nFeud speculation escalated after the palace confirmed Harry and Meghan were moving away from Nottingham Cottage in London to Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, England \u2014 which is further away from Kate and William\u2019s home in Kensington Palace. Despite the move, sources maintained to Us that the two women get along. \u201cThey are two women under serious amounts of pressure, stress and under a huge spotlight that no one can relate to \u2013 they will always have a bond that no one can break.\u201d\n\nAnother insider told Us that Meghan, who was constantly making headlines for being difficult in the British press, was \u201cfrustrated\u201d that she couldn\u2019t speak out and defend herself to the media. \u201cShe\u2019s always relied on her own voice to stand up for others, and for herself. So not being able to say anything is a debilitating feeling,\u201d the second insider said. \u201cShe\u2019s always been so independent, her entire life, and that\u2019s all been taken away from her. She\u2019s always been able to clap back on social media and now she can\u2019t.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Biggest-Royals-stories-2018-6.jpg?w=900&quality=82&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Biggest-Royals-stories-2018-2.jpg?w=900&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Biggest-Royals-stories-2018-1.jpg?w=900&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Drops-Nickname-for-Taylor-Swift.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=600%2C338&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/a360media-logo-color.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AmazonIsh.png?crop=35px%2C0px%2C1281px%2C1281px&resize=300%2C300&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Biggest-Royals-stories-2018-4.jpg?w=900&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Biggest-Royals-stories-2018-7.jpg?w=900&quality=55&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Biggest-Royals-stories-2018-5.jpg?w=900&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-photos-of-2018-101.jpg?w=1000&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-photos-of-2018-101.jpg?crop=0px%2C96px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-photos-of-2018-101.jpg?w=900&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/royal-family-prince-charles-birthday-01.jpg?w=900&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/meghan-markle2.jpg?w=900&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/prince-harry-megahn-markle.jpg?w=900&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Biggest-Royals-stories-2018-3.jpg?w=900&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-photos-of-2018-101.jpg?crop=0px%2C96px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/meghan-markle-prince-harrys-wedding-biggest-royal-stories-of-2018/", "title": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry\u2019s Wedding: Biggest Royal Stories of 2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "ahrefs-site-verification": "0c593552a61f5d2f07d12f3629456cc24366510fb83bd76eb9504919faac5af7", "post-format": "gallery", "post-tags": "Best of the Year,The Royals", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "From Meghan Markle becoming a member of the British royal family to Prince Louis\u2019 birth, Us Weekly rounds up the biggest royal stories of 2018", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry\u2019s Wedding: Biggest Royal Stories of 2018", "description": "From Meghan Markle becoming a member of the British royal family to Prince Louis\u2019 birth, Us Weekly rounds up the biggest royal stories of 2018", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/meghan-markle-prince-harrys-wedding-biggest-royal-stories-of-2018/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-12-21T16:42:55+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-photos-of-2018-101.jpg?crop=0px%2C96px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Best-photos-of-2018-101.jpg?crop=0px%2C96px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-12-21T16:42:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-12-21T16:42:55+00:00"}, "author": "Sarah Hearon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Year of Meghan!
