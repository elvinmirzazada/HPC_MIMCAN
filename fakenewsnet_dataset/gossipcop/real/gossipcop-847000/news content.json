Farrah Abraham revealed in a new interview why she walked off the set of the season premiere of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition.\n\nRelated: Biggest Costar Feuds and Fights Ever! These celebrities can\u2019t stand each other in real life \u2014 see the biggest costar feuds ever!\n\nThings got tense on the Friday, April 28, episode when the Teen Mom OG star mentioned her 2010 physical altercation with her now-estranged mother, Debra Danielsen. Danielsen was arrested for the incident after she allegedly choked and hit her then 18-year-old daughter, TMZ reported at the time. She was later charged with assault in an Iowa court.\n\nAbraham walked off the set of the WE tv reality series on Friday night after her mom called the since-dropped charges \u201cbogus\u201d and claimed that Abraham had threatened to kill her.\n\nRelated: Teen Mom Stars, Then and Now! It\u2019s been quite a journey for the cast of Teen Mom. The series launched in December 2009 as the first spinoff from MTV\u2019s 16 and Pregnant. The debut season followed the lives of Maci Bookout, Catelynn Lowell, Amber Portwood and Farrah Abraham, who all experienced very different journeys during their teen pregnancies. On season 5, [\u2026]\n\n\u201cWhy am I raising my voice, why am I arguing and fighting up against somebody who can\u2019t admit to what is really happening and going on in our family history?\u201d the MTV star told E! News. \u201cI get really upset when I\u2019m around liars. I detest people who lie. I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d\n\nAbraham hinted that future episodes of Marriage Boot Camp will also focus on her fight with Danielsen. \u201cThere is an episode where we talk about traumatic experiences, my mom and I, and we still cannot get on the same page,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, sometimes between lie detector tests and traumatic experiences, there\u2019s just a certain point in time where you\u2019re like, \u2018Somebody does not have the wherewithal to take accountability to even remember things,\u2019 and you\u2019re like, \u2018Why do I even want to be around them anymore?\u2019 The best narcissists can block things out and act like nothing ever happened to just keep going.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV The road to success in Hollywood is a little different for every would-be actor, but these days, reality TV is becoming a major launching pad for some of the industry's biggest stars. Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\nNonetheless, the reality star doesn\u2019t regret sharing her personal life with viewers. \u201cI really believe in sharing my story to improve social behaviors in the nation,\u201d she told E! News. \u201cI think that\u2019s the best way to do it through media. And I\u2019ve made history time and time again with that.\u201d\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
