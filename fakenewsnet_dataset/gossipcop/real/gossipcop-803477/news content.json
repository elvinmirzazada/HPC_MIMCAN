Recognized for her songwriting, musical versatility, artistic reinventions, and influence on the music industry, she is a prominent cultural figure of the 21st century.\n\nSwift began professional songwriting at age 14 and signed with Big Machine Records in 2005 to become a country singer. She released six studio albums under the label, four of them to country radio, starting with her 2006 self-titled album. Her next, Fearless (2008), explored country pop, and its singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" catapulted her to prominence. Speak Now (2010) infused rock influences, while Red (2012) experimented with electronic elements and featured Swift's first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\". She departed from her country image with 1989 (2014), a synth-pop album supported by the chart-topping songs \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\n\nSwift signed with Republic Records in 2018. She released the pop album Lover (2019) and autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), embraced indie folk and alternative rock on 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, explored chill-out styles on Midnights (2022), and released four re-recorded albums subtitled Taylor's Version after a dispute with Big Machine. The albums spawned the number-one songs \"Cruel Summer\", \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"All Too Well\" and \"Is It Over Now?\". In 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour and released its top-grossing concert film. She has also directed music videos and films such as All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\n\nWith over 200 million records sold globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians. She is the most-streamed woman on Spotify and Apple Music, the highest-grossing female performer ever, and the first billionaire with music as the main source of income. She has been featured in lists such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists, the Time 100, and Forbes Celebrity 100.

Swift is also an advocate of artists' rights and women's empowerment.\n\nLife and career\n\nEarly life\n\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch[4] and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (n\u00e9e Finlay), is a former homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Taylor has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift,[6] and is of Scottish,[7] German, and Italian descent.[8][9] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was an opera singer.[10]\n\nSwift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father had purchased from one of his clients.[11][12] She is a Christian.[13] She attended preschool and kindergarten at Alvernia Montessori School, a Montessori school run by the Bernadine Franciscan sisters,[14] before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[15] The family moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[16] where Swift attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[17] She spent summers in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, until she was 14 years old, performing in a local coffee shop.[18][19]\n\nAt age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[20] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[21] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\".[22] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[23][24] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[25] She traveled there with her mother at age eleven to visit record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[26] She was rejected, however, because \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"[27]\n\nWhen Swift was around 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. \"Kiss Me\" by Sixpence None the Richer was the first song Swift learned to play. Cremer helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write \"Lucky You\".[28][29] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York\u2013based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and met with major record labels.[30] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[31][32][33] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[11][34] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[35] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[36]\n\n2004\u20132008: career beginnings and first album\n\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[37][38] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[39] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[40] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[41] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[33][24] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[42]\n\nSwift opening for Brad Paisley in 2007. To promote her first album, she opened tours for other country musicians in 2007 and 2008.[43]\n\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[44] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[33] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[45][46] She began working on her eponymous debut album with producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right \"chemistry\".[24] Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone and co-wrote the remaining eight with Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[47] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[48] Country Weekly critic Chris Neal deemed Swift better than previous aspiring teenage country singers because of her \"honesty, intelligence and idealism\".[49] The album peaked at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks\u2014the longest stay on the chart by any release in the U.S. in the 2000s decade.[50] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a U.S. platinum-certified debut album.[51]\n\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[52] As there was not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[52] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[53] as a replacement for Eric Church.[54] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market\u2014teenage girls who listen to country music.[52][11]\n\nFollowing \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one.

Both releases peaked atop the Billboard 200,[235] becoming the first ever re-recorded albums to do so.[236] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\", which made her the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on the Hot Country Songs chart.[237] Red (Taylor's Version) was supported by \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[238] The song was accompanied by a short film, which won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video[239] and Swift's record third MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year.[240]\n\nSwift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released on October 21, 2022.[241] Experimenting with chill-out music,[242] it received critical acclaim; Rolling Stone critics dubbed it an instant classic.[243][244] The album was Swift's fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies and broke various sales and streaming records,[245] including the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify.[246] Its tracks, led by the single \"Anti-Hero\", monopolized the entire top 10 of the Hot 100, making Swift the first artist to do so.[247] Two other singles, \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\", both peaked at number two on the Hot 100.[248] Swift won nine awards at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year (\"Anti-Hero\") for a record fourth time,[249] and received six nominations at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, including a record seventh for Song of the Year (\"Anti-Hero\").[250] She embarked on the Eras Tour in March 2023. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's cultural and economic impact,[251] and its U.S. leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[247] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling ticket sales and alleged monopoly in the concert industry.[252] A concert film of the tour, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, became the highest-grossing concert film ever.[253]\n\nSwift continued releasing her re-recorded albums during the Eras Tour. Speak Now (Taylor's Version), released on July 7, 2023, made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand.[254] 1989 (Taylor's Version) was released on October 27, 2023, and became Swift's record-extending sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the U.S.[255] The best-selling album of 2023, it surpassed Midnights for the largest album sales week of her career and garnered the most U.S. first-week vinyl sales of the 21st century.[255] Its single \"Is It Over Now?\" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100.[256]\n\nBeyond her albums, Swift featured on five songs from 2021 to 2023: \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" by Big Red Machine,[257] a remix of \"Gasoline\" by Haim,[258] \"The Joker and the Queen\" by Ed Sheeran,[259] and \"The Alcott\" by the National.[260] For the soundtrack of the 2022 film Where the Crawdads Sing, she recorded \"Carolina\", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[261] Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity post-pandemic.[262] Music Business Worldwide remarked that she entered a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" in 2023.[263] Swift was the most streamed artist of 2023 on Spotify and Apple Music,[264][265] and became the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023).[266]\n\nOutside of music, Swift had a supporting role in the 2022 period comedy film Amsterdam and signed to direct an upcoming feature film for Searchlight Pictures.[267][268] Swift began dating American football player Travis Kelce in 2023.[269]\n\nArtistry\n\nInfluences\n\nOne of Swift's earliest memories of music is listening to her grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church. As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own.\"[270] Swift said she owes her confidence and \"fascination with writing and storytelling\" to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[271][272]\n\nSwift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[273] introduced to the genre by \"the great female country artists\" of the 1990s\u2014Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[274][275] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[276] Hill was Swift's childhood role model, as she would often imitate her.[277] She admired the Chicks' defiant attitude and ability to play their own instruments,[278] and was also influenced by older country stars like Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton,[23] the last of whom she believes is exemplary to female songwriters.[113] As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell's emotional and autobiographical lyrics, highlighting Mitchell's album Blue as a favorite \"because it explores somebody's soul so deeply.\"[279] She also spoke of influence from 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan and Alanis Morissette,[280][281] and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin[282] and Lori McKenna.[283]\n\nVarious pop and rock artists have also influenced Swift. She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as her career role models.[11][284] 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[285][286] She also cited Keith Urban's musical style and Fall Out Boy's lyrics as major influences.[287][288]\n\nGenres\n\n\"If there's one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it's that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk's newest raconteur.\" \u2014The Recording Academy, 2021[289]\n\nSwift is known for venturing into various music genres and undergoing artistic reinventions,[290][268] having been described as a \"music chameleon\".[291][292] She self-identified as a country musician until 2012, when she released her fourth studio album, Red. Her albums were promoted to country radio, but music critics noted wide-ranging styles of pop and rock.[295] After 2010, they observed that Swift's melodies are rooted in pop music, and the country music elements are limited to instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and fiddle, and her slight twang;[296][297] some commented that her country music identity was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical style.[298][299] Although the Nashville music industry was receptive of Swift's status as a country musician, critics accused her of abandoning her roots in favor of crossover success in the mainstream pop market.[301] Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles intensified the critical debate, to which Swift responded, \"I leave the genre labeling to other people.\"\n\nMusic journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her musical career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[303] She abandoned her country music identity in 2014 with the release of her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989. Swift described it as her first \"documented, official pop album\". Her subsequent albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop, trap, and EDM elements.[305][306][307] Midnights (2022), on the other hand, is distinguished by a more experimental, \"subdued and amorphous pop sound\".[308][309] Although reviews of Swift's pop albums were generally positive, some critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift's pursuit of mainstream success, eroding her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background\u2014a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist.[310] Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift's pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry. Swift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative, folk and indie rock styles with her 2020 studio albums Folklore and Evermore.[313][314] Clash said her career \"has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing\", reaching a point at which \"Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift\", not defined by any genre.[315]\n\nVoice\n\nSwift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range, and a generally soft but versatile timbre.[318][319] As a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries. Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career and has worked hard to improve.[321] Reviews of her vocals remained mixed after she transitioned to pop music with 1989; critics complained that she lacked proper technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to the audience, prioritizing \"intimacy over power and nuance\". They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times remarked that Swift's defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling\u2014\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[324] With Reputation, critics noted she was \"learning how to use her voice as a percussion instrument of its own\",[325] swapping her \"signature\" expressive vocals for \"cool, conversational, detached\" cadences and rhythms similar to hip hop and R&B styles.[326][327][328] Alternative Press stated that her \"evocative\" vocal stylings are more reminiscent of pop-punk and emo genres.[329]\n\nReviews of Swift's later albums and performances were more appreciative of her vocals, finding them less nasal, richer, more resonant, and more powerful.[297][330][331] With Folklore and Evermore, Swift received praise for her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled voice.[332][333][334] Pitchfork described it as \"versatile and expressive\".[335] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and \"fuller\" tone of her voice.[336][337][338] An i review said Swift's voice is \"leagues better now\" with her newfound vocal furniture.[339] The Guardian highlighted \"yo-yoing vocal yelps\" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift's voice,[340] and that her country twang faded away.[341] Midnights received acclaim for Swift's nuanced vocal delivery.[342] She ranked 102nd on the 2023 Rolling Stone list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[319] In a review of the Eras Tour, The New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich praised the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals.[343]\n\nSongwriting\n\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters of all time by several publications.[344][345][346] English-language scholars like Jonathan Bate and Stephanie Burt have noted that her literary and melodic sensibility and verbal writing style are rare amongst her peers.[347][348] Swift's bridges are often underscored as one of the best aspects of her songs,[349][350] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[351] Mojo described her as \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[352]\n\nIn The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[11] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[353][354] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[355][356] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[357][358] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[359] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[285] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[360] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[361] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[362][363] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[272][364]\n\nHer confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[365][11][366] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music.[367][368][369] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[370][371] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[327] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[371] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[11] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[372][373][374] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[375]\n\nOn her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[376] Without referencing her personal life, she imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[355] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[376] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[377] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[350]\n\nSwift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", referring to songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[378] Critics note the fifth track of every Swift album as the most \"emotionally vulnerable\" song of the album.[379] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\" than Swift.[380] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[381] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[247] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[382]\n\nPerformances\n\nSwift performing on the Reputation Stadium Tour in Seattle in May 2018. A review by Stereogum likened her onstage persona to those of \"classic rock deities\".[383]\n\nJournalists have described Swift as one of the best performers and entertainers in mainstream music. Often praised for her showmanship and stage presence,[384][385][386] Swift is known for her ability to command large audiences, such as in a stadium,[387][388][389] without having to rely fully on dance like her contemporaries do.[390] According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[391]\n\nIn a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[392] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[393] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[394]\n\nCritics have highlighted Swift's versatility as an entertainer, praising her ability to switch onstage personas and performance styles depending on the varying themes and aesthetics of her albums.[395][396] Her concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[397] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[398] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar,[399] acoustic guitar, piano,[400] and sometimes a banjo or ukulele.[401][402] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[343][403] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[404][400] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop's most approachable superstar\",[405] and the 21st century's most popular performer.[406]\n\nSwift performing in 2022\n\nVideo and film\n\nSwift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music making process.[407] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011[408] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before.[409] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"[410]\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos\u2014four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement in the craft.[411] She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed), and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[412] Swift produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[413]\n\nHer production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[414] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles \"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and \"Lover\" with Drew Kirsch,[415] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[416] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[247] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[417] Swift has cited Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as her filmmaking influences.[407]\n\nAchievements\n\nIn 2009, Swift became the first country singer in history to win an MTV Video Music Award.\n\nSwift has won 12 Grammy Awards (including three for Album of the Year\u2014tying for the most by an artist),[418] an Emmy Award,[419] 40 American Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[420] 39 Billboard Music Awards (the most won by an artist\u2014tying with Drake),[421] 111 Guinness World Records,[422] 23 MTV Video Music Awards (including four Video of the Year wins\u2014the most by an act),[249] 12 Country Music Association Awards (including the Pinnacle Award),[423] eight Academy of Country Music Awards,[424] and two Brit

person on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015.[426][427] At the 64th BMI Awards in 2016, Swift was the first woman to be honored with an award named after its recipient.[428]\n\nFrom available data, Swift has amassed over 50 million album sales and 150 million single sales as of 2019,[429][430][431] and 114 million units globally, including 78 billion streams as of 2021.[432][433] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) ranked her as the Global Recording Artist of the Year for a record three times (2014, 2019 and 2022).[434] Swift has the most number-one albums in the United Kingdom and Ireland for a female artist this millennium,[435][436] earned the highest income for an artist on Chinese digital music platforms (RMB 159,000,000 as of 2021),[437] and is the first artist to replace themselves at the top spot and occupy the entire top five of the Australian albums chart.[438][439] Swift remains the world's highest-grossing female touring act of all time, with cumulative ticket sales at $1.68 billion as of September 2023 according to Pollstar.[440] The Eras Tour is the highest-grossing tour ever by a woman as of August 2023.[441] Beginning with Fearless, each of her studio albums have opened with over one million global units.[442][443] Swift is the most streamed female act on Spotify and Apple Music.[444][445] On Spotify, she is the only artist to have received more than 200 and 250 million streams in one day (260 million on October 27, 2023),[446] and the only female act to reach 100 million monthly listeners.[447] The most entries and the most simultaneous entries for an artist on the Billboard Global 200, with 142 and 31 songs, respectively, are among her feats.[448][449]\n\nIn the US, Swift has sold over 37.3 million albums as of 2019,[431] when Billboard placed her eighth on its Greatest of All Time Artists Chart.[450] Eleven of her songs have topped the Billboard Hot 100.[256] She is the longest-reigning act of the Billboard Artist 100 (84 weeks);[451] the soloist with the most cumulative weeks atop the Billboard 200 (64);[452] the woman with the most Billboard 200 number-ones (13),[255] Hot 100 entries (231),[453][156] top-ten songs (49),[256] and weeks atop the Top Country Albums chart (99);[454] and the act with the most number-one songs on Pop Airplay (12) and Digital Songs (27).[455][456] Swift is the first woman to simultaneously chart four albums in the top 10 and 11 albums on the entire Billboard 200.[457][458] She is the second highest-certified female digital singles artist (and fifth overall) in the U.S., with 137.5 million total units certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[459] and the first woman to have both an album (Fearless) and a song (\"Shake It Off\") certified Diamond.[460] Swift is the only artist in Luminate Data history to have five albums sell over a million copies in a week.[461]\n\nSwift has appeared in various power listings. Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[462] She was one of the \"Silence Breakers\" honored as Time Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault.[463] In 2014, she was named to Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in the music category[464] and again in 2017 in its \"All-Star Alumni\" category.[465] Swift became the youngest woman to be included on Forbes' list of the 100 most powerful women in 2015, ranked at number 64.[466] Swift received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.[247]\n\nCultural status\n\nSwift at the 2010 Time 100 Gala\n\nSwift has made a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture, economy and beyond.[467][468] She dominates cultural conversations,[469][470] and hence publications describe her as a cultural \"vitality\" or zeitgeist.[471][472][473] Her music, life and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[290] Initially a teen idol,[474] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[305][475] publications describe her immense popularity and longevity as a kind of fame unwitnessed since the 20th century.[476][477] In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the \"world's biggest pop star\" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[303] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[478]\n\nHer fans are known as the Swifties.[252] Billboard noted only few artists have had her chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support, resulting in a wide impact.[479] Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[480][481] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[482]\n\nLabeled by the media in her early career as \"America's Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[483] Swift has been accused by detractors of being \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[173][174] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and slut-shaming,[485][486] as well as a topic of rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[487] She has been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[488][489]\n\nLegacy\n\n\"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we're at this moment where there's no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that's on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\" \u2013 Jason Lipshutz, Billboard executive director, 2023[490]\n\nSwift helped shape the modern country music scene,[491] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[303][491] pioneered the use of internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[33][52] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[492][303] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[493] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\", a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[494][495]\n\nAccording to publications, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[496] and her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[497] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[498] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift in the 21st century.[499][500] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album \"eras\".[501][502] Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research.[290] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural and sociopolitical contexts.[503][290]\n\nSwift has influenced numerous music artists, and her albums have inspired an entire generation of singer-songwriters.[492][313][504] Journalists praise her ability to reform industry practices, noting how her actions changed streaming policies, prompted awareness of intellectual property in new musicians,[505][506] and reshaped ticketing models.[507] Various sources deem Swift's music a paradigm representing the millennial generation;[508] Vox called her the \"millennial Bruce Springsteen\",[509] and The Times named her \"the Bob Dylan of our age\".[510] Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from Billboard,[511] Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[512] and Global Icon at the Brit Awards for her impact.[433] Senior artists such as Paul McCartney,[513] Mick Jagger,[514] Madonna,[515] and Parton have praised her musicianship.[516] Carole King regards Swift her \"professional grand daughter\" and thanked Swift for \"carrying the torch forward\".[517] Springsteen called her a \"tremendous\" writer,[518] while Ringo Starr and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles' successor.[519][520] Britney Spears labeled Swift \"the most iconic pop woman of our generation\".[521]\n\nEntrepreneurship\n\nMedia outlets describe Swift as a savvy businesswoman.[522][523] She is also known for her traditional album rollouts, consisting of a variety of promotional activities that Rolling Stone termed as an inescapable \"multimedia bonanza\".[524][525] Easter eggs and cryptic teasers became a common practice in contemporary pop music because of Swift.[526] Publications describe her discography as a music \"universe\" subject to analyses by fans, critics and journalists.[527][528][529] Swift maintains an active presence on social
