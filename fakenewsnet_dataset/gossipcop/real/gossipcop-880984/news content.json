This week, GRAMMY.com spoke with Billy Idol about his latest EP, Cage, and continuing to rock through decades of changing tastes. Billy Idol is a true rock 'n' roll survivor who has persevered through cultural shifts and personal struggles. While some may think of Idol solely for \"Rebel Yell\" and \"White Wedding,\" the singer's musical influences span genres and many of his tunes are less turbo-charged than his '80s hits would belie. Idol first made a splash in the latter half of the '70s with the British punk band Generation X. In the '80s, he went on to a solo career combining rock, pop, and punk into a distinct sound that transformed him and his musical partner, guitarist Steve Stevens, into icons. They have racked up multiple GRAMMY nominations, in addition to one gold, one double platinum, and four platinum albums thanks to hits like \"Cradle Of Love,\" \"Flesh For Fantasy,\" and \"Eyes Without A Face.\" But, unlike many legacy artists, Idol is anything but a relic. Billy continues to produce vital Idol music by collaborating with producers and songwriters \u2014 including Miley Cyrus \u2014 who share his forward-thinking vision. He will play a five-show Vegas residency in November, and filmmaker Jonas Akerlund is working on a documentary about Idol\u2019s life. His latest release is Cage, the second in a trilogy of annual four-song EPs. The title track is a classic Billy Idol banger expressing the desire to free himself from personal constraints and live a better life. Other tracks on Cage incorporate metallic riffing and funky R&B grooves.\n\nIdol continues to reckon with his demons \u2014 they both grappled with addiction during the '80s \u2014 and the singer is open about those struggles on the record and the page. (Idol's 2014 memoir Dancing With Myself, details a 1990 motorcycle accident that nearly claimed a leg, and how becoming a father steered him to reject hard drugs. \"Bitter Taste,\" from his last EP, The Roadside, reflects on surviving the accident.) Although Idol and Stevens split in the late '80s \u2014 the skilled guitarist fronted Steve Stevens & The Atomic Playboys, and collaborated with Michael Jackson, Rick Ocasek, Vince Neil, and Harold Faltermeyer (on the GRAMMY-winning \"Top Gun Anthem\") \u2014 their common history and shared musical bond has been undeniable. The duo reunited in 2001 for an episode of \"VH1 Storytellers\" and have been back in the saddle for two decades. Their union remains one of the strongest collaborations in rock 'n roll history. While there is recognizable personnel and a distinguishable sound throughout a lot of his work, Billy Idol has always pushed himself to try different things. Idol discusses his musical journey, his desire to constantly move forward, and the strong connection that he shares with Stevens. Steve has said that you like to mix up a variety of styles, yet everyone assumes you're the \"Rebel Yell\"/\"White Wedding\" guy. But if they really listen to your catalog, it's vastly different. Yeah, that's right. With someone like Steve Stevens, and then back in the day Keith Forsey producing... [Before that] Generation X actually did move around inside punk rock. We didn't stay doing just the Ramones two-minute music. We actually did a seven-minute song. [Laughs]. We did always mix things up. Then when I got into my solo career, that was the fun of it. With someone like Steve, I knew what he could do. I could see whatever we needed to do, we could nail it. The world was my oyster musically. \"Cage\" is a classic-sounding Billy Idol rocker, then \"Running From The Ghost\" is almost metal, like what the Devil's Playground album was like back in the mid-2000s. \"Miss Nobody\" comes out of nowhere with this pop/R&B flavor. What inspired that? We really hadn't done anything like that since something like \"Flesh For Fantasy\" [which] had a bit of an R&B thing about it. Back in the early days of Billy Idol, \"Hot In The City\" and \"Mony Mony\" had girls [singing] on the backgrounds. We always had a bit of R&B really, so it was actually fun to revisit that. We just hadn't done anything really quite like that for a long time. That was one of the reasons to work with someone like Sam Hollander [for the song \"Rita Hayworth\"] on The Roadside. We knew we could go [with him] into an R&B world, and he's a great songwriter and producer. That's the fun of music really, trying out these things and seeing if you can make them stick. I listen to new music by veteran artists and debate that with some people. I'm sure you have those fans that want their nostalgia, and then there are some people who will embrace the newer stuff. Do you find it\u2019s a challenge to reach people with new songs? Obviously, what we're looking for is, how do we somehow have one foot in the past and one foot into the future? We\u2019ve got the best of all possible worlds because that has been the modus operandi of Billy Idol. You want to do things that are true to you, and you don't just want to try and do things that you're seeing there in the charts today. I think that we're achieving it with things like \"Running From The Ghost\" and \"Cage\" on this new EP. I think we\u2019re managing to do both in a way. Obviously, \"Running From The Ghost\" is about addiction, all the stuff that you went through, and in \"Cage\" you\u2019re talking about freeing yourself from a lot of personal shackles. Was there any one moment in your life that made you really thought I have to not let this weigh me down anymore? I mean, things like the motorcycle accident I had, that was a bit of a wake up call way back. It was 32 years ago. But there were things like that, years ago, that gradually made me think about what I was doing with my life. I didn't want to ruin it, really. I didn't want to throw it away, and it made [me] be less cavalier. I had to say to myself, about the drugs and stuff, that I've been there and I've done it. There\u2019s no point in carrying on doing it. You couldn't get any higher. You didn't want to throw your life away casually, and I was close to doing that. It took me a bit of time, but then gradually I was able to get control of myself to a certain extent [with] drugs and everything. And I think Steve's done the same thing. We're on a similar path really, which has been great because we're in the same boat in terms of lyrics and stuff. So a lot of things like that were wake up calls. Even having grandchildren and just watching my daughter enlarging her family and everything; it just makes you really positive about things and want to show a positive side to how you're feeling, about where you're going. We've lived with the demons so long, we've found a way to live with them. We found a way to be at peace with our demons, in a way. Maybe not completely, but certainly to where we\u2019re enjoying what we do and excited about it. [When writing] \"Running From The Ghost\" it was easy to go, what was the ghost for us? At one point, we were very drug addicted in the '80s. And Steve in particular is super sober [now]. I mean, I still vape pot and stuff. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s doing it, but it\u2019s incredible. All I want to be able to do is have a couple of glasses of wine at a restaurant or something. I can do that now. I think working with people that are super talented, you just feel confident. That is a big reason why you open up and express yourself more because you feel comfortable with what's around you.\n\nDid you watch Danny Boyle's recent Sex Pistols mini-series? I did, yes. You had a couple of cameos; well, an actor who portrayed you did. How did you react to it? How accurate do you think it was in portraying that particular time period? I love Jonesy\u2019s book, I thought his book was incredible. It's probably one of the best bio books really. It was incredible and so open. I was looking forward to that a lot. It was as if [the show] kind of stayed with Steve [Jones\u2019 memoir] about halfway through, and then departed from it. [John] Lydon, for instance, was never someone I ever saw acting out; he's more like that today. I never saw him do something like jump up in the room and run around going crazy. The only time I saw him ever do that was when they signed the recording deal with Virgin in front of Buckingham Palace. Whereas Sid Vicious was always acting out; he was always doing something in a horrible way or shouting at someone. I don't remember John being like that. I remember him being much more introverted. But then I watched interviews with some of the actors about coming to grips with the parts they were playing. And they were saying, we knew punk rock happened but just didn't know any of the details. So I thought well, there you go. If [\"Pistol\" is] informing a lot of people who wouldn't know anything about punk rock, maybe that's what's good about it. Maybe down the road John Lydon will get the chance to do John's version of the Pistols story. Maybe someone will go a lot deeper into it and it won't be so surface. But maybe you needed this just to get people back in the flow. We had punk and metal over here in the States, but it feels like England it was legitimately more dangerous. British society was much more rigid. It never went [as] mega in America. It went big in England. It exploded when the Pistols did that interview with [TV host Bill] Grundy, that lorry truck driver put his boot through his own TV, and all the national papers had \"the filth and the fury\" [headlines]. We went from being unknown to being known overnight. We waited a year, Generation X. We even told them [record labels] no for nine months to a year. Every record company wanted their own punk rock group. So it went really mega in England, and it affected the whole country \u2013 the style, the fashions, everything. I mean, the Ramones were massive in England. Devo had a No. 1 song [in England] with \"Satisfaction\" in '77. Actually, Devo was as big as or bigger than the Pistols. You were ahead of the pop-punk thing that happened in the late '90s, and a lot of it became tongue-in-cheek by then. It didn't have the same sense of rebelliousness as the original movement. It was more pop. It had become a style. There was a famous book in England called Revolt Into Style \u2014 and that's what had happened, a revolt that turned into style which then they were able to duplicate in their own way. Even recently, Billie Joe [Armstrong] did his own version of \"Gimme Some Truth,\" the Lennon song we covered way back in 1977. When we initially were making [punk] music, it hadn't become accepted yet. It was still dangerous and turned into a style that people were used to. We were still breaking barriers.\n\nYou have a band called Generation Sex with Steve Jones and Paul Cook. I assume you all have an easier time playing Pistols and Gen X songs together now and not worrying about getting spit on like back in the '70s? Yeah, definitely. When I got to America I told the group I was putting it together, \"No one spits at the audience.\" We had five years of being spat on [in the UK], and it was revolting. And they spat at you if they liked you. If they didn't like it they smashed your gear up. One night, I remember I saw blood on my T-shirt, and I think Joe Strummer got meningitis when spit went in his mouth. You had to go through a lot to become successful, it wasn't like you just kind of got up there and did a couple of gigs. I don't think some young rock bands really get that today. With punk going so mega in England, we definitely got a leg up. We still had a lot of work to get where we got to, and rightly so because you find out that you need to do that. A lot of groups in the old days would be together three to five years before they ever made a record, and that time is really important. In a way, what was great about punk rock for me was it was very much a learning period. I really learned a lot [about] recording music and being in a group and even writing songs. Then when I came to America, it was a flow, really. I also really started to know what I wanted Billy Idol to be. It took me a little bit, but I kind of knew what I wanted Billy Idol to be. And even that took a while to let it marinate. You and Miley Cyrus have developed a good working relationship in the last several years. How do you think her fans have responded to you, and your fans have responded to her? I think they're into it. It's more the record company that she had didn't really get \"Night Crawling\"\u2014 it was one of the best songs on Plastic Hearts, and I don't think they understood that. They wanted to go with Dua Lipa, they wanted to go with the modern, young acts, and I don't think they realized that that song was resonating with her fans. Which is a shame really because, with Andrew Watt producing, it's a hit song. But at the same time, I enjoyed doing it. It came out really good and it's very Billy Idol. In fact, I think it\u2019s more Billy Idol than Miley Cyrus. I think it shows you where Andrew Watt was. He was excited about doing a Billy Idol track. She's fun to work with. She\u2019s a really great person and she works at her singing \u2014 I watched her rehearsing for the Super Bowl performance she gave. She rehearsed all Saturday morning, all Saturday afternoon, and Sunday morning and it was that afternoon. I have to admire her fortitude. She really cares.", "images": ["https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/Franc Moody.jpg?w=821&sm=c", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/twitter-icon", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/youtube-icon", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/search", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/facebook-icon", "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/HH50_GR_Kendrick_Hero_1920x1080.jpg?w=821&sm=c", "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/gettyimages-848815714.jpg.jpg?w=821&sm=c", "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/gettyimages-848815714.jpg", "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/Hip-Hop-ReDefined_Olen_Hero_1920x1080.jpg?w=821&sm=c", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=338622743242551&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/Billy Idol_ by Steven Sebring.jpg?w=821&sm=c", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/2023-new-members-class-recording-academy-announcement-Invitation-Email-header-1200-690", "https://cdn.media.amplience.net/i/naras/2024-grammys-66G_CBS_Tune_In_Logo_2045x793.webp?w=175", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/connected", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/instagram-icon", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/2024_grammys_nominations_66th_grammy_awards_Noms_Editorial_v3_KeyArt_1644x925", "https://cdn.media.amplience.net/i/naras/RA_Logo_black", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/Banner-Pop_1500x1000", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/2024_grammys_nominations_66th_grammy_awards_Noms_Editorial_v1_KeyArt_1644x925"], "top_img": "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/gettyimages-848815714.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.grammy.com/news/donald-glover-makes-history-emmy-win", "title": "Donald Glover Makes History With Emmy Win", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "mjYJq7vX2IJfypeIqe00aJUZ98j7fzgMwjkIC_eBGto", "robots": "index,follow", "googlebot": "index,follow", "description": "As the world&#039;s leading society of music professionals, the Recording Academy is dedicated to celebrating, honoring, and sustaining music&#039;s past, present, and future.", "og": {"title": "Donald Glover Makes History With Emmy Win | GRAMMY.com", "description": "As the world&#039;s leading society of music professionals, the Recording Academy is dedicated to celebrating, honoring, and sustaining music&#039;s past, present, and future.", "url": "https://www.grammy.com/news/donald-glover-makes-history-emmy-win", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/gettyimages-848815714.jpg", "alt": "GRAMMY.com", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "keywords": "GRAMMY, GRAMMY.COM, Donald Glover Makes History With Emmy Win | GRAMMY.com", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.grammy.com/news/donald-glover-makes-history-emmy-win", "title": "Donald Glover Makes History With Emmy Win | GRAMMY.com", "description": "As the world&#039;s leading society of music professionals, the Recording Academy is dedicated to celebrating, honoring, and sustaining music&#039;s past, present, and future.", "image": "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/gettyimages-848815714.jpg", "site": {"id": 17243213}}, "bingbot": "index,follow", "next-head-count": 33}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.grammy.com", "summary": ""}
