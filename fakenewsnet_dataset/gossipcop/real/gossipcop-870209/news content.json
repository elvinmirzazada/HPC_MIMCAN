And when you combine the two, it's perfection.\n\nRiverdale star Camila Mendes 'grammed an \u00fcber-chic photo of herself over the weekend. In the snap, she's posing with co-stars KJ Apa (Archie Andrews) and Charles Melton (the new Reggie Mantle) with the best prop: Domino's pizza. She appropriately captioned the photo \"Domino's Resort 2017 Collection\" in what I can only hope is some sort of weird Fashion Week collab with the brand. I can dream, OK?! Leave me alone.\n\n\n\nEverything about this photo is perfection, almost too much perfection really. (Seriously, how are they all eating pizza but not having to deal with any greasy cheese stains?!) The cast is currently shooting season two of Riverdale in Vancouver \u2014 presumably this pizza party happened between takes.\n\nSeason one, you'll recall, left off with Archie's dad Fred, played by Luke Perry, shot by a mysterious assailant in Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe. The ultimate cliffhanger left viewers with no choice but to wait until the season two premiere this October to find out if Fred lives or dies, and the anticipation is killer (pun very much intended but also please hang in there, Fred!).\n\nUntil then, only social media can satisfy your Riverdale withdrawals. More pictures, please, Cami. A girl needs her fix.\n\nGiphy\n\nFollow Jillian on Instagram and Twitter and Cosmo Celeb on Facebook.", "images": ["https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/search.f1c199c.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-610528798-1633604500.jpg?crop=0.6666666666666666xw:1xh;center,top&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/cosmopolitan/static/images/logos/network-logo.722abed.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rvd322a-0278r-1-1557958887.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.152xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523DA8EEA&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/saved.ad81f1a.svg?primary=%2523000000", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cami-mendes-pizza-gram-1501516042.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.403xh;0,0.0924xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rvd503fg-0137r-1611248724.jpg?crop=0.564xw:1.00xh;0.159xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2022-02-03-at-3-13-42-pm-1643919322.jpg?crop=0.9962319639738993xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/92688025-941861182913654-48991840849945528-n-1595945994.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.804xh;0,0.104xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/x.3361b6d.svg?primary=%2523DA8EEA&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rvd701fg-0001r-64234680f15c2.jpg?crop=0.564xw:1.00xh;0.274xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/final-60342bb4fa03c000b09ed7bf-835478-1614032188.png?crop=0.484xw:0.484xh;0.516xw,0.00321xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/cosmopolitan/static/images/logos/logo.3c052be.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bonfire-1570634810.jpg?crop=0.536xw:1.00xh;0.264xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523DA8EEA&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2019-10-21-at-5-38-47-pm-1571694131.png?crop=0.636xw:1.00xh;0.183xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rvd506fg-0001r-1628715144.jpg?crop=0.563xw:1.00xh;0.177xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/riverdale-kevin-1501517748.gif?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vanessa-morgan-and-madelaine-petsch-attend-the-cw-networks-news-photo-1596050238.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.667xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/tiktok.603c377.svg?primary=%2523DA8EEA&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pictured-cole-sprouse-winner-of-drama-movie-star-of-2019-news-photo-1579110498.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.727xh;0,0.0235xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523DA8EEA&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/riverdale-1587492464.jpg?crop=0.6666666666666666xw:1xh;center,top&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cami-mendes-pizza-gram-1501516042.jpg?resize=640:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523DA8EEA&id=social-button-icon"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cami-mendes-pizza-gram-1501516042.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.403xh;0,0.0924xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a10386318/camila-mendes-pizza-shirtless-archie-reggie-instagram/", "title": "The Riverdale Cast Had a Shirtless Pizza Party and Wow, It's Hot Stuff", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "The Riverdale Cast Had a Shirtless Pizza Party and Wow, It's Hot Stuff", "description": "I'd give anything to be that pizza, tbh.", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "The \"Riverdale\" Cast Had a Shirtless Pizza Party and Wow, It's Hot Stuff", "description": "I'd give anything to be that pizza, TBH.
