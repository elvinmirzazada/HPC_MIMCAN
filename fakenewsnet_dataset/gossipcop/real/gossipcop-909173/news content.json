For other uses, see Travis Scott (disambiguation)\n\nJacques Bermon Webster II (born April 30, 1991), known professionally as Travis Scott (formerly stylized Travi$ Scott), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Throughout his career, Scott has achieved four number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, along with a total of over a hundred charted songs. Scott has been nominated for eight Grammy Awards and won a Billboard Music Award, Latin Grammy Award, MTV Video Music Award, and multiple BET Hip Hop Awards. As of 2020, Scott has sold over 45 million certified records in the US alone. Scott's musical style has been described as a \"blend between traditional hip-hop and lo-fi\" and often characterized as \"ambient,\" with a heavily appraised influence from rappers Kanye West and Kid Cudi. His stage name is derived from the latter's real name, Scott Mescudi, combined with the name of a favorite uncle.\n\nIn 2012, Scott signed his first major-label recording contract with Epic Records, and a publishing deal with Kanye West's GOOD Music as an in-house producer. In April 2013, he entered a joint-venture record deal with American rapper T.I.'s Grand Hustle Records. Scott self-released his first full-length project, a mixtape titled Owl Pharaoh, in 2013, which was followed with a mixtape titled Days Before Rodeo, in 2014. His debut studio album, Rodeo (2015) was released to critical praise and commercial success. The album preceded by the singles \"3500\" (featuring Future and 2 Chainz) and \"Antidote\"; the latter of which became his first hit song as it peaked at number sixteen on the Billboard Hot 100. His second album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016), became his first number-one album on the Billboard 200 chart. The following year, Scott formed the duo Huncho Jack with rapper Quavo, releasing their eponymous collaborative album (2017).\n\nIn 2018, his third album, Astroworld, was released to widespread critical acclaim and became his second consecutive number one album on the Billboard 200. Additionally, the album produced his first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, \"Sicko Mode\" (featuring Drake).[10] In late 2019, Scott's vanity label imprint, Cactus Jack Records, released the compilation album JackBoys, which also topped the Billboard 200. With his 2019 single \"Highest in the Room\" and 2020 singles \"The Scotts\" (with Kid Cudi) and \"Franchise\" (featuring Young Thug and M.I.A.), Scott became the first artist on the Billboard Hot 100 to have three songs debut at number one in less than a year.[11] Following a series of controversies and five years after the release of his previous solo album, Scott released Utopia (2023), which became his fourth consecutive number one album on the Billboard 200.\n\nOver the course of his career, Scott has become a globally recognized artist and pop culture figure. Along with his highly publicized relationship with American media personality Kylie Jenner, Scott has collaborated with organizations including Nike, Dior, and McDonald's. His Cactus Jack record label, founded in 2017, has signed artists including Don Toliver and Sheck Wes. Scott has gained notoriety for controversies and legal issues regarding safety at his concerts. In November 2021, a mass-casualty crowd crush occurred during Scott's hometown performance at his annual Astroworld Festival, resulting in some condemnation of the artist.[12][13][14]\n\nEarly life\n\nJacques Bermon Webster II[15] was born on April 30, 1991, in Houston, Texas.[16] From ages one through six, Webster lived with his grandmother in South Park, Houston. Located in south-central Houston, the neighborhood was notorious for crime and had an impact on a young Webster, \"Growing up, my grandmother stayed in the 'hood so I seen random crazy shit. [I saw] mad bums and crazy spazzed out motherfuckers, I saw people looking weird, hungry, and grimey [sic]. I was always like, 'I gotta get the fuck out this shit.' It gave me my edge\u2014[it made me] who I am right now.\"[17]\n\nWebster moved to Missouri City, a middle-class suburban area bordering southwest Houston, to live with his parents. His mother worked for Apple and his father ran his own business.[18] Webster's father is also a soul musician and his grandfather was a jazz composer.[19] Webster attended Elkins High School and graduated at seventeen.[20] During high school, he participated in musical theater.[21] Webster then attended the University of Texas at San Antonio, before dropping out his second year to fully pursue his music career.[22][23]\n\nDuring an interview, Webster revealed how he chose his moniker, stating it\u2019s a combination of his favorite uncle named Travis, and the first name of one of his biggest inspirations, Kid Cudi (whose real name is Scott Mescudi).[24]\n\nCareer\n\n2008\u20132012: Career beginnings and record deals\n\nWebster formed a duo with his longtime friend Chris Holloway known as The Graduates.

The Classmates released two projects, with Buddy Rich in 2009 and Cruis'n USA in 2010.[25] Scott mainly handled production work on both projects. The duo remained together until late 2012, when personal conflicts and financial disputes led to the disbandment of the group.[26]\n\nAfter leaving college, Scott moved from Houston to Washington Heights in New York City where Scott began working with friend Mike Waxx, who owned the music website Illroots. After moving to New York, Scott slept on the floor at his friend's house and spent most of his time at Just Blaze's studio. Eventually frustrated in New York and the lack of progression,[27] Scott moved to Los Angeles, California, after only four months in the state.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Webster was abandoned by his friend who had promised to help him by providing housing. His parents cut him off financially and he eventually was forced to relocate back to Houston, where his parents kicked him out of their home. Webster moved back to Los Angeles once again and began to sleep on the couch of a friend who studied at University of Southern California.[28] Atlanta-based rapper and owner of Grand Hustle Records, T.I. would later hear one of Webster's productions, titled \"Lights (Love Sick)\". While in Los Angeles, T.I.'s representative contacted Webster, asking him to attend a studio for a meeting.

They have currently been working on their debut collaborative effort since 2020, when the duo released the Billboard Hot 100 number one single, \"The Scotts\".[143] In December 2022, Cudi revealed they were no longer working on the album, effectively announcing its cancellation.[144] However in July 2023, Cudi stated the album \u201cis [definitely] happening at some point.\u201d[145][146]\n\nFilm industry\n\nScott made his theatrical debut in the 2021 film Gully as a movie store owner.[147] He also contributed to the film's soundtrack but his song \"Knife\" was cut due to sampling issues, but was still featured briefly in the film.

He has said that he would like to write his own musical in the future.[160][161][162]\n\nIn 2021, Scott starred in a cover story of i-D Magazine Issue 362 \"Utopia in Dystopia\" photographed by Spike Jonze.

The philanthropic effort provided $5 million for community-based initiatives in Scott's home state of Texas. Project HEAL is a multi-tier initiative dedicated to addressing challenges facing today's youth, especially those from marginalized and at-risk communities.[167]\n\nPersonal life\n\nScott began dating media personality and businesswoman Kylie Jenner in April 2017.[168] In February 2018, Jenner gave birth to their daughter.[169][170] Jenner appeared in the music video for \"Stop Trying to Be God\", from Scott's third studio album Astroworld.[171] They broke up in September 2019,[172] but quarantined together during the COVID-19 pandemic for the sake of their daughter and ended up rekindling their relationship.[173] On September 7, 2021, after weeks of speculation, Jenner revealed that she and Scott were expecting their second child.[174] Jenner gave birth to their son in February 2022.[175][176][177] The couple separated for a second time by January 2023. [178]\n\nIncidents at performances\n\nScott's performances have experienced a number of issues. At Lollapalooza in 2015, Scott was charged and arrested for disorderly conduct after inciting concertgoers to ignore security and rush the stage.[179] That same year, at the Openair Festival in Switzerland, he encouraged fans to attack a man who took his shoe while he was crowd-surfing, by stopping the concert and repeatedly telling the crowd to \"fuck him up\", while also spitting on him.[180]\n\nIn 2017, he was arrested for similar conduct to his Lollapalooza behavior after a performance in Northwest Arkansas.[181] That same year, a fan sued Scott and the organizers of a 2017 concert at Terminal 5 in Manhattan after falling from a balcony and being dragged on stage, blaming the fall on a crowd surge.[182] In 2019, three people were trampled and injured as a crowd rushed to enter the compound at Astroworld.[183][184]\n\nAstroworld Festival crowd crush\n\nOn November 5, 2021, at least ten people died and hundreds were injured in a crowd crush moving toward the stage during Scott's performance at the Astroworld Festival in NRG Park in his hometown of Houston, Texas.[14] On the first night, a crowd crush occurred, resulting in the cancellation of the second night of the festival.[13][185][12] In video footage of the incident, Scott is seen continuing to perform despite chants from the crowd pleading for him to stop; observing at least one audience member had been hurt, then ordering security for a brief moment to \"help, jump in real quick, keep going\", only to continue with the rest of the show for the following hour; encouraging people to \"get wild\" and \"crazy\", despite an ambulance passing through the crowd that was pulling out lifeless bodies.[186][187] Victims killed ranged from 9 to 27 years old.[188]\n\nShortly after, a lawsuit was announced by the concertgoers. It was started by Kristian Paredes, who filed for $1,000,000 due to the injuries he received. On June 29, 2023, a Texas grand jury decided against indicting Scott.[189] The grand jury declined to indict Scott in a criminal probe of the deadly 2021 crowd surge.[190][191][192] The deaths had happened in November 2021 at Scott's Astroworld in Houston, when a surge in the crowd of 50,000 attendees caused a panic.[193][194][195]\n\nNebula assault allegations\n\nOn March 1, 2023, Scott was performing at Nebula, a nightclub in New York City, alongside Don Toliver when a sound technician, identified only as Mark, asked Scott to lower the music as it was too loud for the venue's size. Scott reportedly responded by giving Mark the middle finger and punching him in the head, resulting in Mark needing medical attention and police being called to the scene around 3:25 a.m. Scott had reportedly been drinking alcohol and damaged $12,000 in the club's sound equipment before he left the premises. The New York City Police Department issued a warrant for Scott's arrest in relation to the incident on March 2, 2023.[196][197] The matter was resolved with a settlement reached and the NYPD not pressing any charges.[198][199]\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nCollaborative albums\n\nFilmography\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nGrammy Awards\n\nThe Grammy Awards are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
