What her daughter did at my home\u2026 was racist, learned behavior etc,\u201d Leakes alleged in a comment on Instagram, adding, \u201cKim is a calculating bio polar racist with a horrible mouth, who uses black folks for her come up.\u201d\n\nShe expanded more about her anger in an episode earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThat word \u2018roach\u2019 just ain\u2019t the word I needed to hear her saying,\u201d NeNe said. \u201cIt sounds very racial when you are speaking to an African-American person and talk about roaches. Because people feel like you associated that with the ghetto or trash. Black people do not receive that very well.\u201d\n\nTibrina Hobson/Getty\n\nThough NeNe was angry about the roach comments then, she made sure Kim knew she was having the last laugh.\n\n\u201cWell I decided to be an exterminator because I just want Kim and her little silly ass dumb f\u2014\u2014 family to know that we are laughing at your ass, bitch,\u201d NeNe said. \u201cHehe, haha. Bitch, the joke is on you.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Cast mates Burruss, Cynthia Bailey, Shere\u00e9 Whitfield, Kenya Moore and Porsha Williams all appreciated the joke.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hilarious, Burruss said, with Williams adding, \u201cY\u2019all did that. Y\u2019all are a petty mess! Petty goals. That is couple petty goals right there.\u201d\n\nEven Kim\u2019s husband Kroy Biermann laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s good humor.\u201d\n\nCharles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images; Paras Griffin/Getty Images\n\nBut Kim was not.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to talk about this, bitch,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to be funny, but it\u2019s not funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else can she be when she has bugs in her house?\u201d Kim added.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s because though Kim was the one to throw the \u201croach nest\u201d insults, she was claiming she was the victim \u2014 telling Whitfield in an episode earlier this month that she received death threats after NeNe\u2019s racist claims.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to hire security. I\u2019ve had people come to the gate at my house,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cShe wants to pull the race card. That\u2019s the devil, bitch,\u201d Kim continued. \u201cShe spent so many years trying to sabotage my name and I just let it roll. Now you\u2019re f\u2014\u2014 with my kids? \u2018The whole family is racist, prejudice?\u2019 My whole family? There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body. Not me, my husband, or my children see color. Never have.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Shere\u00e9 Whitfield on the Status of NeNe Leakes & Kim Zolciak Biermann\u2019s Friendship: \u201cI\u2019m Not Sure They\u2019ll Ever Be Where They Were\u201d\n\nKim went on to explain that she sent Leakes a cease and desist, which she said cost her $20,000.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take this lightly. It\u2019s one thing like I said to kind of banter back and forth and have an opinion,\u201d Kim told E!\u2019s Daily Pop in October. \u201cThis is far beyond just having an opinion.\u201d\n\nNeNe\u2019s response to receiving the cease and desist? \u201cI burned it up with a lighter,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the two avoided each other at the finale, they won\u2019t be able to do that in the upcoming three-part reunion. \u201cYou are f\u2014\u2014 trash,\u201d NeNe screamed at Kim in the teaser for their face-off. \u201cI don\u2019t give a f\u2014 about you. Bye girl, get your ass out.\u201d\n\n\u201cJealousy\u2019s a disease,\u201d Kim said. \u201cGet well, bitch.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta reunion kicks off Sundays (8 p.m. ET) on Bravo.",
