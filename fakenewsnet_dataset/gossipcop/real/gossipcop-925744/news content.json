It\u2019s was the most sick first trimester of all my children,\u201d the Almost Famous star captioned a video of her gender reveal on Instagram. \u201cBoomerangs have made me nauseous, Superzoom is an easy way to have my head in the toilet, food instagrams make me queezy and thinking too much about insta stories made me even more exhausted than I already had been. If you\u2019ve seen me out and about smiling and pretending like everything is amazing\u2026I was lying!\u201d\n\n\u201cBUT! I have broken through on the other end of that and rediscovering the joys of insta/snap. We have been trying to keep this pregnancy under the radar for as long as possible but I\u2019m a poppin now!\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too darn challenging to hide, and frankly hiding is more exhausting then just coming out with it! My kids, Danny, myself and the entire family are crazy excited! A little girl on the way \ud83d\udc95.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Couples and How They First Met: Love Story Beginnings Star-crossed lovers!

His step sisters are my best friends @sarafoster @erinfoster and so it goes we have been in the same circle for over a decade!\u201d Hudson explained in December via Instagram. \u201cA year ago today Danny took me on a hike and what I thought was just a hike with a family friend turned very quickly into an unexpected first date. No moves were made on this first date. In fact, it took months for him to make a first move! And as a kiss on this bridge would have been nice, the kiss a year later was so much sweeter.\u201d\n\nRelated: Kate Hudson\u2019s Bikini Body Through the Years Great Kate!
