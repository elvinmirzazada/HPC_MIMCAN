In the months that followed, the exes have been making headlines for their explosive altercations.\n\nOn June 24, Harley, 31, was charged with domestic battery after the car-dragging incident. She was released from the Clark County Detention Center the following day after posting the $3,000 bail.\n\nLVMPD/Splash News\n\nA spokesperson for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told PEOPLE that a suspicious vehicle call came in at about 10:22 p.m. A patrol unit was dispatched to the intersection and determined that a male and a female were in a struggle over a vehicle. Callers reported that the male was bleeding and the car had two flat tires.\n\nOfficers made contact with Ortiz-Magro, 32. They also made contact with Harley, who was standing by with another citizen. Officers determined that Ortiz-Magro had gotten out of the vehicle and Harley had driven away as he was holding onto the vehicle, dragging him briefly, according to the spokesperson. She was determined to be primary aggressor and arrested on one count of misdemeanor domestic battery.\n\nOrtiz-Magro had apparent minor injuries to the mouth and arm as well as road rash. He was not transported to the hospital.\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, \u201cthe child was picked up by a family friend before officers arrived on the scene.\u201d\n\nOrtiz-Magro was not filming Jersey Shore Family Vacation when the incident occurred and MTV had no comment when reached by PEOPLE. A rep for Ortiz-Magro also had no comment; Harley was unable to be reached.\n\nJen Harley/Instagram. Jen Harley/Instagram\n\nA source told PEOPLE that Ortiz-Magro and his ex were at a barbecue with friends earlier that day, where they got into a \u201cverbal fight.\u201d On the drive home, \u201cthe fight escalated\u201d and Harley \u201cwas pummeling his face,\u201d said the source.\n\n\u201cHe was screaming for her to stop the car as she was driving,\u201d said the source. \u201cShe hit the median and got a flat tire which caused her to slow down. He begged to get out and opened the door but she continued to pull away while he was getting out and it tore up his entire arm. It\u2019s a mess from road rash and from being dragged along the street as he was caught in the belt.\u201d\n\nThe source also confirmed that a mutual friend stepped in to take care of the exes\u2019 infant daughter, noting that \u201ceverybody is so fearful for this baby.\u201d\n\nAccording to the source, Ortiz-Magro had been \u201ctrying his best\u201d to make things work with Harley for the sake of their daughter.\n\n\u201cIf the kid wasn\u2019t involved, it would be over,\u201d said the source. \u201cHe\u2019s constantly trying to make it work for the sake of his daughter. But we\u2019re hopeful this is the final straw and he doesn\u2019t put himself and his daughter back in danger.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Ortiz-Magro flew from Las Vegas to New Jersey with his daughter to resume filming season 2 of Jersey Shore Family Vacation.\n\nRonnie Ortiz-Magro/Instagram\n\nRonnie Ortiz-Magro/Instagram\n\nThe proud dad documented the trip on Instagram, sharing a photo of Ariana with the hashtags #HappyBaby #ShesExcitedToMeetTheRestOfHerNY/NJFamily.\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s excited to go to #Jersey,\u201d he wrote, adding the hashtag #FistPumpinLikeChamps.\n\nSeason 2 of Jersey Shore Family Vacation premieres in August on MTV.", "images":
