Mindy Kaling has walked her first red carpet since it was revealed that she\u2019s expecting her first child. The Wrinkle in Time actress attended the Television Critics Association\u2019s summer press tour to promote her Hulu series The Mindy Project in L.A. on Thursday, July 27.\n\nKaling, who has kept the identity of the father private, opened up about the comedy\u2019s final season and how her character will face mom-shaming.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: TV Pregnancies: How Stars Worked Around Their Baby Bumps At least they could indulge their cravings at craft services!
