Dannielynn Birkhead's net worth is $3 million. That net worth is a combined figure with her father Larry. As we detail later in this article, Dannielynn did not inherit a significant amount of money from her mother. She also did not receive any money from her late mother's fight over a roughly $450 million inheritance she believed she was owed thanks to a brief marriage to billionaire J. Howard Marshall.\n\nRaised by her father in Louisville, Kentucky, Dannielynn largely grew up away from the Hollywood limelight, though her childhood was periodically punctuated by public appearances, primarily at the annual Kentucky Derby. Larry Birkhead worked hard to provide Dannielynn a normal upbringing while also honoring the memory of her late mother.\n\nEarly Life\n\nDannielynn Birkhead was born on September 7, 2006, in Nassau, Bahamas, Dannielynn was immediately in the limelight due to her mother's fame. Her birth was followed by tragedy when her older half-brother, Daniel Wayne Smith, died suddenly just three days later.\n\nWhen Dannielynn was five months old, her mother also passed away, making national headlines. The controversies surrounding her mother's life and death caused Dannielynn to be the center of attention from a very early age.\n\nPaternity\n\nSeveral men came forward and claimed to be her father including American attorney Howard K. Stern who was Anna Nicole's live-in partner at the time of her death on February 8, 2007. Smith's personal bodyguard/fitness instructor Alexander Denk and German-born socialite and current husband of actress Zsa Zsa Gabor Frederic Prinz von Anhalt were also among the men who claimed to be Dannielynn's father.\n\nAfter a protracted legal battle, DNA testing confirmed photographer Larry Birkhead was Dannielynn's biological father, leading to a court granting him full custody in April 2007.\n\nDannielynn Birkhead Inheritance\n\nAccording to the latest court ruling, Dannielynn Birkhead will NOT receive any of the $450 million inheritance from J. Howard Marshall's estate. Anna Nicole Smith claimed that the inheritance was promised to her by the late billionaire with a verbal agreement. After nearly 15 years of lawsuits that outlived J. Howard Marshall, Anna Nicole Smith and J. Howard Marshall's son, an appeals court in Texas ruled that the billionaire never actually intended to leave everything to Smith.\n\nMedia Appearances\n\nIn 2012, at age six, Dannielynn followed in her mother's footsteps by modeling for Guess Kids, making headlines as her mother had been a famous Guess model in the 1990s. This move drew both acclaim and criticism, given her young age and her mother's history. However, the assignment was a one-off gig and was not indicative of a full-fledged modeling career.\n\nAs a teenager, Dannielynn, along with her father, featured in a Lifetime documentary, \"Hopelessly in Love: Anna Nicole Smith and Larry Birkhead,\" providing an in-depth look at the relationship between her parents. She also made occasional appearances on reality television and talk shows.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-132x132/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Howard-K.-Stern-e1559698340598.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-132x132/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CNW-Man-5.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/themes/cnw_2023/svg/logo.svg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-132x132/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Larry-Birkhead-21201503-1-402.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-132x132/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/anna-nicole.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-600x300/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Dannielynn-Birkhead.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Dannielynn-Birkhead.jpg?x81397", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-132x132/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Taylor-Swift.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Dannielynn-Birkhead.jpg?x81397", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/dannielynn-birkhead-net-worth/", "title": "Dannielynn Birkhead Net Worth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Dannielynn Birkhead is the daughter of the late American Playboy model Anna Nicole Smith and freelance celebrity photographer Larry Birkhead.
