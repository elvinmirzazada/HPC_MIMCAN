The 20-year-old actress could retire on the cash she earns by promoting brands on social media.\n\nRelated: The Most Influential Celebrities on Social Media Social media has allowed celebrities to directly communicate with fans over the years. Platforms like Twitter and Instagram have given users a closer look at their favorite celebrities, granting them direct access into their world. Celebrities like Selena Gomez and Chrissy Teigen have used their platforms to speak openly with fans about important issues, while [\u2026]\n\nThorne, who calls Instagram \u201c100 percent a job to me,\u201d revealed in a Wednesday, April 11, Vogue documentary that she rakes in $65,000 per Instagram post. Instagram Stories and Snapchat go for anywhere between $10,000 and $20,000.\n\n\u201cI started out at 18 with literally $200 in my bank account and I bought this house a year later,\u201d Thorne declared. \u201cIt\u2019s all from social media.\u201d (She dropped $2 million on a 4,500-square-foot L.A. home in 2016.)\n\nOf course Thorne isn\u2019t the only celeb sitting on an Instagram gold mine. Michael Heller, CEO of digital marketing firm Talent Resources, previously told Us Weekly that brands pay up to $500,000 for a campaign to Kim Kardashian, while sisters Khloe and Kourtney can make up to $250,000 for sharing snaps\n\nVogue\u2019s \u201cInside the Life of Bella Thorne\u201d is filled with juicy nuggets including how the star\u2019s agents wanted her to be the next Rachel McAdams. \u201cI love Rachel McAdams, but I\u2019m not Rachel McAdams,\u201d Thorne quipped. \u201cI like darker things.\u201d\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that playing CeCe Jones for three seasons on the Disney Channel\u2019s Shake it Up wasn\u2019t Thorne\u2019s dream job. Thorne recalled walking into the audition and thinking \u201cThis pays the bills, this is what you do.\u201d\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.

was about to \u201cphysically live on the street\u201d if she didn\u2019t land the Disney series. \u201cWe were living off Stouffer\u2019s coupons, and that\u2019s what we had to eat every day,\u201d she shared. \u201cThat may not sound like a big deal to everybody, but when you\u2019re a single momraising four kids with debt and you have nothing to your name, it\u2019s s\u2014tty.\u201d\n\nThorne currently stars in the teen drama Midnight Sun with Patrick Schwarzenegger.", "images":
