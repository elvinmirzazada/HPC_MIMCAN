Alamy Stock\n\nThe stars first met on the set of \"That '70s Show,\" when she was just 14 and he was 19, and as fans of the series know, they played each other's love interest for much of the show's 8-season run.\n\nBut despite on-screen chemistry and made-for-TV make-out sessions, they were nothing more that platonic pals off screen.\n\n\"Yep, in the show (we kissed), with no feelings whatsoever,\" Kunis explained to comedian Marc Maron for his \"WTF\" podcast. \"It's the weirdest story that nobody believes, but it's the god's honest truth. There was nothing there, and it was like ... whatever.\"\n\nAnd looking back now, at the age of 34, part of her regrets that.\n\n\"We could have spent 20 years together,\" she said of how long they would have been together if they'd made a love connection back then.\n\nBut there was never really a chance of that happening \u2014 and not just because she was way too young for that when they met.\n\n\"We would have never been together if we didn't both go through what we went through in order to be the people that we were when we reconnected,\" she insisted.\n\nThat included long-running relationships with others \u2014 in particular, her romance with actor Macaulay Culkin and Kutcher's marriage to Demi Moore \u2014 and the life lessons that came with them.\n\nHowever, even then, neither imagined they would have a future together until they stumbled into one.\n\n\"We were at an awards show, and I was backstage,\" she recalled. \"I was like looking around, and there was like a really beautiful man from the back. I was like, 'What a very nice stature of a gentleman.' I was literally, like, 'Ooh, he's kind of hot.' I was single. And then he turned around, and I was like, 'Oh, my god! It's Kutch!' I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was somebody I'd known forever.\"\n\nSoon enough, the duo went from friends to friends-with-benefits.\n\n\"We never dated,\" Kunis continued. \"Let me be clear \u2014 Ash and I hooked up. Literally, I did a movie called 'Friends With Benefits,' he did a movie that was very similar, 'No Strings Attached.' We lived our movies out.\"\n\nThat went on until one of them felt something more than friendship.\n\n\"I walked up to him and I was like, 'You know what? I actually care about you, and I don't wanna mess anything up, so I'm just going to walk away before it becomes too much,'\" she recalled. \"And he was like, 'Got it.'\"\n\nOf course, since they're now married and have two kids together, that wasn't quite the end of the story.\n\n\"The next day he showed up to my house, and he was like, 'Move in with me.'\"\n\nHer reply was a simple \"OK.\"\n\nBut it wasn't so simple for someone else when Kunis shared the happy news. During a recent chat on Dax Shepard's \"Armchair Expert\" podcast, she revealed that her mother had a particularly memorable (and hilarious) reaction.\n\n\"We were driving up Laurel Canyon, and I was like, \u2018Mom, I have to tell you I\u2019m dating somebody,'\" Kunis said. \"And she was like, \u2018Oh, tell me! Who are you dating?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018You\u2019ve got to brace yourself for this one. ... I\u2019m dating Ashton Kutcher.\u2019\"\n\nTo which Kutcher's now-mother-in-law responded, \"'Shut the f--- up!' in Russian.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180731091639im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_31/1287845/mila-kunis-ashton-kutcher-today-tease-171009-tease_2f80dfe1f8775a7593da463da58deb98.fit-760w.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180731091639im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_30/1355145/mila-kunis-ashton-kutcher-today-180723-tease_223254fc77615014123e595c6e610bba.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180731091639im_/https://c.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180731091639im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_30/1355144/mila-kunis-ashton-kutcher-today-180723-tease2_223254fc77615014123e595c6e610bba.fit-760w.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180731091639im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201706/x_tdy_tov_pop_mila_ashton_170628.760;428;7;70;5.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180731091639im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_30/1355145/mila-kunis-ashton-kutcher-today-180723-tease_223254fc77615014123e595c6e610bba.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180731091639/https://www.today.com/popculture/mila-kunis-describes-exactly-how-when-she-fell-ashton-kutcher-t134615", "title": "Mila Kunis describes exactly how \u2014 and when \u2014 she fell for Ashton Kutcher", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180731091639/https://www.today.com/popculture/mila-kunis-describes-exactly-how-when-she-fell-ashton-kutcher-t134615", "title": "Mila Kunis reveals exactly how \u2014 and when \u2014 she fell for Ashton Kutcher", "description": "They've been married for three years and have two children together, but it took the longtime friends a really long time to get there.", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180731091639im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_30/1355145/mila-kunis-ashton-kutcher-today-180723-tease_223254fc77615014123e595c6e610bba.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_30/1355145/mila-kunis-ashton-kutcher-today-180723-tease_223254fc77615014123e595c6e610bba.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180731091639im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_30/1355145/mila-kunis-ashton-kutcher-today-180723-tease_223254fc77615014123e595c6e610bba.1024;576;7;70;5.jpg", "title": "Mila Kunis reveals exactly how \u2014 and when \u2014 she fell for Ashton Kutcher", "description": "They've been married for three years and have two children together, but it took the longtime friends a really long time to get there.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "They've been married for three years and have two children together, but it took the longtime friends a really long time to get there.
