It's all Very Real. Parenting looks hella annoying! (But rewarding! Don't write me emails about how parenting is the hardest job you ever really loved, or whatever! I believe you!)\n\nAnyway, watch the fun familial scene on repeat below:\n\nAnd here's some stills, because they're adorable:\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram\n\nIn November 2017, Carrie took a bad fall outside her home that left her with a broken wrist and an alarming face injury that required 40-50 stitches.\n\nCarrie explained the accident on a visit to iHeartRadio\u2019s The Bobby Bones Show on Thursday.\n\n\"I was taking the dogs out to go pee one last time, and I just\u2014I tripped,\" she said. \"There was one step, and I didn\u2019t let go of the leashes! Priorities! So that\u2019s why my left hand\u2019s fine. But I went to catch myself and I just missed a step.\"\n\nShe continued: \"If I had fallen anywhere else, I would have been perfectly fine,\" she added. \"But it was one step that messed everything up.\"\n\nLater, in an Instagram post, she wrote, \"I want you all to understand why I might look a bit different. I\u2019m hoping that, by then, the differences are minimal, but, again, I just don\u2019t know how it\u2019s all going to end up.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Carrie performed her new single \"Cry Pretty\" during the Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday\u2014her first performance since the 2017 Country Music Awards, and the first time fans saw her post-accident face in person.", "images":
