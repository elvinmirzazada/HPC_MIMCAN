Tuesday night, and fielded a question about Madonna\u2019s, uh, interpretation, of her iconic role in Andrew Lloyd Weber\u2019s Evita.\n\nThe musical, for which LuPone won a Tony, was adapted into a successful film in 1996. But even though Madonna won a Golden Globe for her performance, LuPone (who admits she\u2019s never watched the full movie) wasn\u2019t impressed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the musical, the character of Eva Peron famously sings, \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy, you\u2019ll think it strange, when I try to explain how I feel.\u201d This is a problem Ms. LuPone has never had. Here\u2019s her full quote in all its glory:\n\n\u201cI thought it [the scene I saw] was a piece of shit. Madonna is a movie killer. She\u2019s dead behind the eyes. She couldn\u2019t act her way out of a paper bag. She should not be on film or on stage. She\u2019s a wonderful, you know, performer for what she does, but she is not an actress. Bing.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLuPone also reveals that the only thing Madonna has \u201cever\u201d said to her was, \u201cI\u2019m taller than you.\u201d\n\n[ONTD]\n\nIn other Bravo news, Phaedra Parks reportedly claims the channel\u2019s producers are responsible for the rumor (about Kandi wanting to drug Porsha) that got her fired from Real Housewives of Atlanta.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA source tells Page Six:\n\n\u201cPhaedra tried to blame producers for manipulating the scenario, and it was cut from the reunion show. They\u2019re not allowed to break the \u2018fourth wall\u2019 and talk about production. It may not have been entirely Phaedra\u2019s fault, but she has to take the fall.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBravo told Page Six:\n\n\u201cProduction is not involved.\u201d\n\nI told Page Six:\n\n\u201cI love you.\u201d\n\n[Page Six]\n\nBusy Philipps and her family went on a Disney cruise and it was NOT spon, which she made perfectly clear by using the hashtag #IPaidForThis. Look at the photos, watch her stories, and say a prayer that there isn\u2019t a norovirus outbreak.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/yxltg5pbkz1xhdbijgew.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/yxltg5pbkz1xhdbijgew.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://jezebel.com/feud-alert-patti-lupone-calls-madonna-dead-behind-the-1795084988", "title": "Feud Alert?!
