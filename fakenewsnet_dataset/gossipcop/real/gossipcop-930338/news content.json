Sorrentino, 36, and his brother Marc were initially indicted in September 2014 for tax offenses and conspiring to defraud the United States after allegedly failing to properly pay taxes on $8.9 million in income from 2010 to 2012. In April 2017, both men were indicted on additional charges including tax evasion, structuring and falsifying records.\n\nIn January, Sorrentino pled guilty to one count of tax evasion and was sentenced to eight months in prison on Oct. 5. (His brother Marc pled guilty to one count of aiding in the preparation of a false and fraudulent tax return and was sentenced to two years in prison.)\n\nOf the Jan. 15 surrender date, a rep for Sorrentino told PEOPLE that the reality star is \u201cgrateful to continue work, celebrate the holidays and his three years sober milestone\u201d before beginning his sentence.\n\n\u201cHe looks forward to completing his sentence and coming home to Lauren, family and friends,\u201d the rep added.\n\nSorrentino and Pesce met in math class in community college.\n\n\u201cWe went out together for about four years, and then once Jersey Shore started we decided to take a break throughout seasons 1-6,\u201d he told PEOPLE earlier this year. \u201cOnce [the show] was over, we eventually reconnected and have been together ever since, for over four years now.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s my best friend, my better half,\u201d he added. \u201cShe makes me a better person. I\u2019m so excited that she\u2019s in my life.\u201d\n\nLuis Ylanes/Splash News\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi Opens Up Ahead of Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d Sorrentino\u2019s Sentencing: \u201cYou Gotta Deal with It\u201d\n\nHe proposed to her on Valentine\u2019s Day, and the emotional engagement unfolded on Jersey Shore Family Vacation in June, with the MTV star getting down on one knee to deliver a heartfelt declaration that brought his costars to tears: \u201cI fell in love with you because you loved me when I couldn\u2019t even love myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much, and for us to finally get engaged, it\u2019s really special,\u201d he told viewers. \u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t guaranteed. It\u2019s been very stormy for a while. The odds were against me. People bet against me. But against all odds, she\u2019s been there throughout the ups and downs, the good times and the bad times.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to get to this day for so long,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd right now, I\u2019m feeling like all these bad times that I\u2019ve been through, it\u2019s all worth it for this moment right here. Lauren is the light at the end of my tunnel. Lauren is my everything, Lauren is my best friend, she is my soulmate, she is my better half. And knowing that I found that, I\u2019m willing to face anything in life.\u201d\n\nJersey Shore Family Vacation airs Thursdays (8 p.m. ET) on MTV.", "images":
