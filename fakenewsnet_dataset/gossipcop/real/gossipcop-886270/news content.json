Cyrus, 24, wore a black and multi-colored floral dress with blue mascara and Liam, 27, looked dapper in a black suit and color coordinated tie.\n\nMeanwhile, leading man Chris, 34, dressed in a cobalt blue suit with open collar dress shirt. He was accompanied by wife Elsa Pataky.\n\nEver since reconciling last fall, the Younger Now singer and the Hunger Games actor, who dated for three years before splitting in 2013, have kept their relationship out of the spotlight.\n\nIn a recent interview with Howard Stern, Cyrus revealed the reason behind their breakup.\n\n\u201cI had to. I don\u2019t like when relationships are two halves trying to make a whole,\u2019 The Voice judge told Stern during his first appearance on his radio show. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t think that I have that co-dependency. I think people that break up and get back together, that\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nAdding, \u201cYou get time to be yourself. You get time to grow up. I think if you\u2019re growing up attached to another person, you never really get solid as your own being.\u201d\n\nAlso at the Thor: Ragnarok premiere were the film\u2019s stars Cate Blanchett (in Gucci), Mark Ruffalo and Tessa Thompson (in Schiaparelli).\n\nThor: Ragnarok hits theaters Nov. 3.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/ben-affleck-b.jpg?crop=99px%2C116px%2C2058px%2C1378px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/chris.jpg?crop=102px%2C0px%2C1076px%2C719.89523809524px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/nicole-kidman.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1300px%2C871px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gwyneth-paltrow-brad-pitt.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3550px%2C2375.119047619px&resize=420%2C281", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/pennywise.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein.jpg?crop=49px%2C16px%2C1305px%2C873px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-georgina-chapman.jpg?crop=142px%2C0px%2C1723px%2C1152px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/etta-ng.jpg?crop=0px%2C174px%2C2000px%2C1339px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/violetta-komyshan-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C68px%2C1500px%2C1004px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/thor-ragnarok.jpg?w=2000&h=1333", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-1.jpg?w=450", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gwyneth-harvey.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1591px%2C1064.4547619048px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://people.com/movies/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-chris-hemsworth-thor-ragnarok-premiere/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-2.jpg?w=2000&h=3149"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343/http://people.com/movies/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-chris-hemsworth-thor-ragnarok-premiere/", "title": "Miley Cyrus & Liam Hemsworth Make Rare Red Carpet Appearance to Support His Brother Chris at Thor: Ragnarok Premiere", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1143086910", "description": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth enjoyed date night at the Los Angeles premiere of Thor: Ragnarok, the latest Marvel film\u2026", "keywords": "miley cyrus, liam hemsworth, chris hemsworth, thor: ragnarok, the voice, miley cyrus fiance", "news_keywords": "miley cyrus, liam hemsworth, chris hemsworth, thor: ragnarok, the voice, miley cyrus fiance", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Miley Cyrus & Liam Hemsworth Make Rare Red Carpet Appearance to Support His Brother Chris at Thor: Ragnarok Premiere", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055343/http://people.com/movies/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-chris-hemsworth-thor-ragnarok-premiere/", "description": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth enjoyed date night at the Los Angeles premiere of Thor: Ragnarok, the latest Marvel film starring Liam\u2019s brother Chris Hemsworth.
