Hearing my friend completely break, it almost felt like an out-of-body experience. It hurt; it was painful.\"\n\nJack was a true hero for rescuing his family from a house fire, but ultimately succumbed once he was at the hospital, which meant Moore had a lot of emotional scenes and a lot of tears to shed.\n\n\"Poor Mandy had about four weeks where she was crying every day,\" he recalled.\n\nWe're going to miss seeing Jack and Rebecca snuggling! Ron Batzdorff/NBC\n\nAnd it's not as if Ventimiglia was taking a nap, lying on the hospital bed while she wept over him. \"It's about remaining still,\" he said about playing dead. \"I just focus on a spot on the ceiling and relax the muscles in my face.\"\n\nAfterward, the \"This Is Us\" actor says he gave Moore some room to recover from all that crying.\n\n\"I just waited until she came and knocked on my trailer door (once filming was done),\" he said. \"We had a big hug and there was laughter and even a, 'Thank God that's over.'\"\n\nAt least, until season three, when apparently we'll see him again!\n\nFollow Randee Dawn on Twitter.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180926173231im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_23/1344126/this-is-us-today-tease-2-180606_79e996fc6f9e5c4ade9b2b835b887605.fit-760w.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180926173231im_/https://c.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180926173231im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_23/1344126/this-is-us-today-tease-2-180606_79e996fc6f9e5c4ade9b2b835b887605.1200;630;7;70;2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180926173231im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_23/1344127/this-is-us-today-inline-180606_2aff6603ac85a6f99b539a24a643d1d6.fit-760w.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180926173231im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201804/tdy_pop_milo_180417_1920x1080.760;428;7;70;5.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180926173231im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_23/1344126/this-is-us-today-tease-2-180606_79e996fc6f9e5c4ade9b2b835b887605.1200;630;7;70;2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180926173231/https://www.today.com/popculture/milo-ventimiglia-mandy-moore-s-reaction-jack-s-us-death-t130363", "title": "Milo Ventimiglia on Jack's 'This Is Us' death, Mandy Moore's reaction", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180926173231/https://www.today.com/popculture/milo-ventimiglia-mandy-moore-s-reaction-jack-s-us-death-t130363", "title": "Milo Ventimiglia shares how 'painful' Jack's death was for Mandy Moore", "description": "Moore apparently had \"four weeks\" of \"crying every day.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180926173231im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_23/1344126/this-is-us-today-tease-2-180606_79e996fc6f9e5c4ade9b2b835b887605.1200;630;7;70;2.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_23/1344126/this-is-us-today-tease-2-180606_79e996fc6f9e5c4ade9b2b835b887605.1200;630;7;70;2.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180926173231im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_23/1344126/this-is-us-today-tease-2-180606_79e996fc6f9e5c4ade9b2b835b887605.1024;512;7;70;2.jpg", "title": "Milo Ventimiglia shares how 'painful' Jack's death was for Mandy Moore", "description": "Moore apparently had \"four weeks\" of \"crying every day.\"", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Milo Ventimiglia and Mandy Moore became friends while playing husband and wife on \"This Is Us,\" which made his character's exit tough on them both.", "thumbnail": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_23/1344126/this-is-us-today-tease-2-180606_79e996fc6f9e5c4ade9b2b835b887605.1024;768;7;70;3.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
