Officials say it is only 50 percent contained.\n\nThe 270,000-acre wildfire has already destroyed several homes in Montecito and is estimated to have destroyed 1,000 homes in Ventura and Santa Barbara.\n\nLowe has been posting on Instagram about the wildfires since they began earlier this month, and even uploaded a picture of himself in full fire gear and a garden hose as he attempted to protect his own house.\n\nCelebrity Chef Jose Andres is also offering his culinary skills and generosity by bringing together local chefs to put together meals for those fighting the fires.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d Andres said. \u201cWe are chefs and we know one thing, which is to feed people.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ve gathered in a local mission and are putting together dishes like savory bread pudding using donated ingredients.\n\n\u201cEmergency requires that we don\u2019t plan, we don\u2019t meet \u2014 we go, we find a kitchen, we get food and we begin cooking and feeding anybody in need,\" said Andres, who also volunteered his time and skills in Puerto Rico after the devastating hurricanes.\n\nRELATED STORIES", "images": ["https://www.insideedition.com/undefined?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/images/2023-11/daniel_mobley.png?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/images/2017-12/121917-rob-lowe-1280x720.jpg?crop=1280:720&width=1280", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/images/2023-11/train.jpg?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.insideedition.com/img/logos/ie-logo.svg", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/images/2023-11/hessroberto.jpg?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/images/2023-01/013023_presley_wil_web.jpg?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/images/2023-11/untitled_design_-_2023-11-28t143057.791.jpg?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196"], "top_img": "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/images/2017-12/121917-rob-lowe-1280x720.jpg?crop=1280:720&width=1280", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.insideedition.com/actor-rob-lowe-treats-firefighters-home-cooked-meal-thank-you-saving-his-house-39105", "title": "Actor Rob Lowe Treats Firefighters to Home-Cooked Meal as a Thank You for Saving His House", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Lowe\u2019s home in Montecito was most recently threatened by the Thomas Fire, which has been burning since Dec. 4.", "og": {"description": "Lowe\u2019s home in Montecito was most recently threatened by the Thomas Fire, which has been burning since Dec. 4.", "title": "Actor Rob Lowe Treats Firefighters to Home-Cooked Meal as a Thank You for Saving His House", "site_name": "Inside Edition", "url": "https://www.insideedition.com/actor-rob-lowe-treats-firefighters-home-cooked-meal-thank-you-saving-his-house-39105", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/images/2017-12/121917-rob-lowe-1280x720.jpg?crop=1280:720&width=1280", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "type": "Articles", "video": "https://cbsi-insideedition-video-fastly.global.ssl.fastly.net/2019/09/09/1600055875737/121917_rob_lowe_webmp4-5687559475001_303105_5192.mp4"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lowe\u2019s home in Montecito was most recently threatened by the Thomas Fire, which has been burning since Dec. 4.", "title": "Actor Rob Lowe Treats Firefighters to Home-Cooked Meal as a Thank You for Saving His House", "url": "https://www.insideedition.com/actor-rob-lowe-treats-firefighters-home-cooked-meal-thank-you-saving-his-house-39105", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/images/2017-12/121917-rob-lowe-1280x720.jpg?crop=1280:720&width=1280", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@insideedition", "site": {"identifier": "@insideedition", "id": 23603092}}, "title": "Actor Rob Lowe Treats Firefighters to Home-Cooked Meal as a Thank You for Saving His House", "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-19T12:17:52-0800", "opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Inside Edition, Inspirational, , wildfire, rob, fire", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 34, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "fb": {"pages": 71728150722, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 966341826790079}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513714672.0, "source": "https://www.insideedition.com", "summary": ""}
