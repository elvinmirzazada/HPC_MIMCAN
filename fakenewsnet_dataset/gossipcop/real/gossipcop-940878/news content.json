I feel so blessed!! Built in besties!! I love you guys!! Rob, you\u2019re already my ACE for life!!\u201d\n\nReferencing the cheating scandal on one of the album\u2019s songs, West raps, \u201cAll these thots on Christian Mingle / That\u2019s what almost got Tristan single / If you don\u2019t ball like him or Kobe / Guarantee that bitch gon\u2019 leave you.\u201d\n\nNews of Thompson\u2019s alleged infidelity broke two days before the couple welcomed their daughter, True, in April.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

What do you guys do when you need motivation to work out?\u201d\n\nSome fans were quick to point out that Kardashian may have purposely chosen Swift\u2019s song because of West\u2019s reference to Thompson\u2019s cheating scandal.\n\nWhile Kardashian has been living in Cleveland, Ohio, since welcoming True, earlier this week Kris Jenner told Entertainment Tonight that her daughter would be back in California \u201creally soon,\u201d and added that her daughter is \u201cloving being a mom.\u201d\n\nSources have also previously told PEOPLE that despite the cheating scandal, Kardashian is \u201cin a really good place\u201d and \u201cfeels whole\u201d with her first child.\n\nKhloe Kardashian/Instagram\n\nKardashian has yet to directly address Thompson\u2019s alleged infidelity, but on Wednesday, the new mom made it a priority to set one fan straight after they claimed the reality star has been \u201csuper passive\u201d following the scandal.\n\n\u201cA year from now @khloekardashian will be over all of this and feeling salty for her super passive IG posts. She\u2019s just in the stage of \u2018but I love him!\u2019 Until then let her pretend he\u2019s changed and they\u2019ll be a happy family. #WednesdayWisdom,\u201d a social media user tweeted at the mom of one on Wednesday.\n\nKardashian responded that same day, writing, \u201cBabe that\u2019s not wisdom at all because you\u2019re assuming you know who I\u2019m talking about and you\u2019re assuming you know my feelings. Assuming anything is anything but wisdom.\u201d\n\nThe tweet came days after the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star spoke out against fans who feel like it\u2019s their place to offer unsolicited advice.\n\n\u201cPeople these days are focused so much on someone else\u2019s life instead of their own,\u201d she wrote last Sunday. \u201cThey love to give advice but are not living the advice that they are offering. Most of the ones giving advice are in no place to give anything at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cFocus on your own world. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s cracks there that need your attention. We all got em,\u201d she added.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/pjjh9nrJommjXc8Pm2TPl4uAsUs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(539x0:541x2)/Khloe-Kardashian-DONDA-Listening-Party2-e5cd3dae35914151a73fb1288080f895.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/SAfFYlqL3gs_YdJJJsJzpCKesp4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x269:736x271)/khloe-tristan-8fbd8b2e4b3544138b960a4f845211a9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/TiI0bXH1Amce-L1J-v1dbhLw_pM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x425:961x427)/khloe-tristan-cd6ebffe3b374e979ce23a4417a1878a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/R22xybSCqPddmhUZhsBr6LwFMQQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x464:1001x466)/khloe-kardashian-1-f4d684cb2fc743f9a4b2cd57baa261c0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qFeOF1UClP6AdTRfgwP5ri2gN20=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kim-kardashian-khloe-kardashian-pete-davidson-92922-3a060f9a13a9493f98c6ce1636e95e9d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/RizGLkM1C1vLwEfAMwubBxY81kg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-c19a4b572e16499fa0b2ef5e9a69f5f0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/iWidsP7SZniCQzqbKKl7DPTFyvE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(524x239:526x241)/khloe-tristan-bbb5e1a6e54f46afa6fbcf4c79ec5a6d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/xI8iC4-onOIX4t4f7fpXTrPT7yI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x449:766x451)/khloe-kardashian-welcomes-son-01_092122-6dbfe5eb7478447aa91360815118c06d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/xaENrvabXQ6UtqGDM4D6ztVJ3_8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/tristan-thompson-khloe-k-b7c484c8fe3a4f9eb54e3a16ec4a3bb3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/sxC_mUp6uYbRbUHJhkeQE2mANjM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(509x179:511x181)/khloe-kardashian-597e47c8a647483e8a691041023b6413.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/t_XGEWIcc3TedcT0aMBKn_gBuaE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x319:736x321)/tristan-thompson-kim-kardashian-ef68aa6903dd41aca0f7e56fd6a794f6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/W1deAMUewGsUkRsfzf2d9yYNguc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x59:706x61)/khloe-kardashia-single-020623-2-8f13903083f94332ba7702597c29b592.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/x_sIZOqgDEhGyI7xOc3lAYsV55I=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(409x243:411x245)/khloe-kardashian-children-050823-92b18f738549415f9a2e65881c6ff8e3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/e8ikhT7WEumh2JgyYdmpPD5tFWY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x279:766x281)/khloe-kardashian-889c5d51a4bd4cdeac8e3e3d463e7bd4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/kRaF6MEatrzPnts9nLKBnfYiQc8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-060723-3be85e5d092249e3bf794830263a20f7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/cZjvaUorWxZGhXlSmT5wD88EpJA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/khloe-7-2000-d59f20792dfe44229e54c9fc22866a6c.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/cZjvaUorWxZGhXlSmT5wD88EpJA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/khloe-7-2000-d59f20792dfe44229e54c9fc22866a6c.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Staff Editor For Human Interest S Digital Vertical At People.
