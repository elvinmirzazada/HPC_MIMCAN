And we\u2019re definitely not mad about it.\n\nThe carefree warthog and meerkat were arguably the most memorable characters in the original 1994 animated film. Not only did they anchor the incredibly catchy \u201cHakuna Matata\u201d number, they also landed an animated TV series. So you know a lot of thought and consideration went into these casting decisions.\n\nThe Timon and Pumbaa news comes more than two months after it was revealed Donald Glover will play the lead role of Simba and James Earl Jones will take on Mufasa. The cast looks good so far, but we wonder who will be tapped to play Scar and Nala.\n\nSources told Variety the film\u2019s director Jon Favreau\u2014the man behind the live-action remake of The Jungle Book\u2014is eyeing the one and only Beyonc\u00e9 for the role of Nala. Considering the movie is now being fast-tracked, it shouldn't be much longer before Disney reveals the rest of the cast.\n\nThe Lion King is scheduled to hit theaters on July 19, 2019.", "images":
