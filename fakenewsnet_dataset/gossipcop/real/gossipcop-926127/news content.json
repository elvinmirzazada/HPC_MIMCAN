I will never just order food to take a photo and then not eat it.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/fL9RANZxhqF4gjqhjqpBg3_qscg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(622x32:624x34)/sister-wives-chrstine-brown-vacation-041023-3455a5c41b4847f293091aa81b18660f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/mrP8rAV9MY63Z6OBy2vvWXvzZHg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Chrissy-Teigen-Says-Shes-Madly-Sick-From-Cruise-with-Family-042723-1-e277bf3b7245430c8b31dd7559dc0c13.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ebcUKFpR08zSvgEhQ-urRBs3GPQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(517x402:519x404)/kim-kardashian-celebs-in-japan-042623-1b1999eb6bc944b68dba618ff9d9be3b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/QOvgeglh7Kcmw65f1UCNm0QO5os=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x459:751x461)/cole-sprouse-ali-fournier-1-c764eea1a8b24181944ba3838aaaafd1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Eqk0JhbEWHWsLHPwYwXzmGVrFbQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(333x92:335x94)/gabrielle-union-wade-vacation-gallery-050523-1-1f871cad8a3e4c6caeeb97f63ef48364.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/MddOMAk9J_kf-3-kBlLxqaPz06s=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/shawn-mendes-sunburn-mexico-032823-1-1e17ed7dcc1d449290195bb8fd45fade.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tkKsJk5S9rvVurEm_p4XBX3pcNg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(616x0:618x2)/shay-mitchell-99c7e0bbf8b24a0a9740b252bfe5127f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/EKUZWP3XfUSyHlGefNLfjwW6eY0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(455x62:457x64)/ariana-madix-england-042423-1-075d575941ee4290a9fb9d36ba681746.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/gTleTW39IELX0zQ4ZAAn6F8TQSo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(463x27:465x29)/heather-rae-el-moussa-private-jet-050223-5-c77f19d467b348af967b2b9e664837b4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rur1ffZ2KMwbAe8mqn0DyefAujA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/latto-coachella-valley-music-and-arts-festival-041723-1-ccbb66cd67164a5a91252464412c0c89.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/EFIi9OiOz8UUF-_V4WUK2pEgD-k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(441x10:443x12)/kylie-jenner-pizza-050323-deec0fb6fdf04ab99c23ca8ed532d74f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qCLzKyEeeWj-fUDRmej-nHnaKQE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/queen-elizabeth-grandchildren-portrait-042123-1A-f6e07cfc0b6946f99c2bbca752464e3c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/sdQsqeKmQ4Xb-3DMsI_6msaVH8k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/gettyimages-902810584-1-2000-40df6ca3012c4f1a93f7db6d044d5922.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/o848DHUtYL8TjMjBsBMxC-GGKU4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x539:1001x541)/rudy-pankow-elaine-siemek-1-01f652edb23c4c009474fcdafa3ccbaa.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/YBMGliVh1bQXmrb6dY1BFn7T6Pw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(724x325:726x327)/thomas-rhett-disney-world-092223-tout-6b70099150384a9cb50d6b99e39c03c7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hkljxdoZIvqFyIKY4m2DgTrxmc8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1059x358:1061x360)/Hailey-Baldwin-Bieber-032723-01-43203df2ef5b4a7e9404736eb34d8ec5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/khA5MFhD9TkTF1HZPAquGu6J8nY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x524:981x526)/jesse-palmers-emely-fardo-tout-e7a6e36a90f54de5976b827ff3a20519.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/tkKsJk5S9rvVurEm_p4XBX3pcNg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(616x0:618x2)/shay-mitchell-99c7e0bbf8b24a0a9740b252bfe5127f.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Staff Editor For Human Interest S Digital Vertical At People.
