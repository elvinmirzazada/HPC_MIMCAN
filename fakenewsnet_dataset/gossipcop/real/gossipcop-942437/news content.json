Beginning with the 1960 Rat Pack film Ocean's 11, the series has seen mixed to favorable critical reception and substantial commercial success. After the 1960 film, a trilogy was released from 2001 to 2007, often cited as defining its genre and leading to a proliferation and commercialization of heist films throughout the world.[1][2] The most commercially successful was the first film, Ocean's Eleven (2001). It established the ensemble cast of George Clooney as Danny Ocean, Matt Damon as Linus Caldwell, and Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan. A long list of supporting cast members maintain the trilogy. The first sequel, Ocean's Twelve, was released in 2004, with the final film, Ocean's Thirteen, following in 2007. An all-female spin-off titled Ocean's 8 was released in 2018.\n\nOrigin [ edit ]\n\nThe Ocean's film series was inspired by and based on the 1960 heist film Ocean's 11. Directed by Lewis Milestone, with a script co-written by Harry Brown and Charles Lederer, from an original story by George Clayton Johnson and Jack Golden Russell; the movie starred five of the Rat Pack: Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Joey Bishop.[3]\n\nFilms [ edit ]\n\nOcean's Eleven (2001) [ edit ]\n\nMaster thief Danny Ocean (George Clooney), just out of prison, plans an elaborate Las Vegas three-casino-heist to win back his ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts).

Olivia Milch wrote the screenplay, and Gary Ross directed the film.[5][6] Helena Bonham Carter, Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling,[7][8][9] Anne Hathaway, Rihanna, Nora \"Awkwafina\" Lum[10] and Sarah Paulson star in the film.[11] The film was released in the United States on June 8, 2018.[12]\n\nFuture [ edit ]\n\nUntitled prequel film [ edit ]\n\nIn May 2022, a prequel film set in 1960s Europe was revealed to be in development.

Tom Ackerley and Roach will additionally serve as producers. The project will be a joint-venture production between Warner Bros. Pictures, LuckyChap Entertainment, and Village Roadshow.

However, in June 2021, Don Cheadle revealed that Steven Soderbergh had been working on the concept of a sequel film.
