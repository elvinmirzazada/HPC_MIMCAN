Among her other stumbles? Call Me By Your Name\u2018s screenwriter James Ivory and producers Luca Guadagnino, Emilie Georges and Marco Morabito; The Post\u2018s producer Kristie Macosko Krieger, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u2018s producers Graham Broadbent and Pete Czernin.\n\n\u201cMissouri\u201d proved to be a recurring problem as well, Haddish wavering between pronouncing the state \u201cMissour-ie\u201d and \u201cMissour-a\u201d while reading the film\u2019s 7 nominations.\n\nThe actress later took to Twitter and said that she felt like she \u201cwas a substitute teacher in a Key & Peel skit\u201d in a reply to The Disaster Artist writer Michael H. Weber, whose name she also struggle with.\n\nAcademy of Motion Pictures and Sciences\n\nTwitter couldn\u2019t get enough.\n\n\u201cI could watch Tiffany Haddish mispronounce names all morning,\u201d said writer Joe Berkowitz.\n\n\u201cI had my name butchered at my college graduation but I would\u2019ve been totally fine with it had it been Tiffany Haddish,\u201d Teen Vogue writer Gabe Bergado said.\n\nAdded one user with a conspiracy theory: \u201cThey gave the Tiffany Haddish the hard names on purpose!\u201d\n\nOf course, there were those who weren\u2019t as charmed by Haddish\u2019s struggles.\n\n\u201cThis is brutal watching Tiffany Haddish mispronounce everything during these Oscar announcements,\u201d wrote morning DJ Abe Kanan. \u201cIt was disrespectful and pathetic.\u201d\n\nBut even The Disaster Artist\u2018 Michael H. Weber, who was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay alongside writer Scott Neustadter, praised Haddish for it.\n\n\u201cTiffany Haddish can mispronounce my name any way she wants!\u201d he tweeted after she messed up his name. \u201cWOOOOOOO.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just her mispronunciations that had Twitter laughing. The stand-up star was also throwing out jokes here and there. \u201cDo you think they could install a steam shower in my house? \u2018Cause I need one,\u201d she joked after the Production Design nominees were announced.\n\n\u201cI gotta see this Dunkirk. It seems like a lot of people like it,\u201d she added after the Christopher Nolan film then picked up back-to-back nominations for Sound Editing and Sound Mixing.\n\nAfter announcing the nominees for Best Animated Short Film and Best Live Action Short Film, Haddish quipped, \u201cThe last category proves that length doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d\n\nAnd the Best Documentary Short Subject nominees \u2014 Edith and Eddie, Heaven is a Traffic Jam on the 405, Heroin(e), Knife Skills, and Traffic Stop \u2014 had Haddish shook. \u201cAll these titles make a woman from an urban area very uncomfortable,\u201d she joked. \u201cI\u2019m just saying\u2026\u201d\n\nBy morning\u2019s end, it appeared everyone was asking for Haddish to host the Oscars.\n\nShe\u2019ll have to wait though, as Jimmy Kimmel is returning to host the ceremony for the second year in a row. He famously hosted the ceremony last year, when the wrong film was announced as the Best Picture winner.\n\nDespite the snafu, Kimmel received rave reviews for his performance as host. He held nothing back while making a few jabs at Mel Gibson, Justin Timberlake and Manchester by the Sea. And of course, he brought his ongoing feud with Matt Damon to the show.\n\nThe 2018 Oscars ceremony will be held at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center on March 4 and will be televised live on ABC at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT.", "images":
