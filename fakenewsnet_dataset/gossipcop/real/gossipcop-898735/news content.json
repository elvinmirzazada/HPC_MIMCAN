Brendan McDermid / Reuters\n\nNassar, 54, agreed to a minimum 40-year sentence when he pleaded guilty last year to seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual misconduct in Ingham County. He still faces sentencing in Eaton County for three more counts, and he's already been sentenced to 60 years in federal prison for possession of child pornography.\n\n\"I signed your death warrant,\" Aquilina said.\n\nThe judge could have given Nassar a stiffer sentence than the one he agreed to, but that would have given him the option of withdrawing his plea and asking for a trial.\n\nBefore the sentence was handed down, Nassar was allowed to speak. Turning to the victims sitting behind him, he said their statements had shaken him to the core.\n\n\"What I am feeling pales in comparison to [your] pain, trauma and emotional destruction,\" he said. \"There are no words to describe the depth and breadth of how sorry I am for what has occurred. An acceptable apology to all of you is impossible to write or convey.\n\n\"I will carry your words with me for the rest of my days.\"\n\nIf Nassar thought the statement would earn him sympathy, it failed.\n\nThe judge took out a six-page letter he sent the court last week in which he insisted what he had done to the victims \"was medical not sexual,\" that he was a \"good doctor\" and the victim of a media frenzy, and that prosecutors had pressured him to to admit to things he had not done.\n\n\"'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,'\" she read, her voice full of scorn.\n\nShe asked him: \"Would you like to withdraw your plea?\"\n\n\"No, your honor,\" he said.\n\n\"Because you're guilty aren't you?\" she pressed.\n\n\"I made my plea,\" he said.\n\nApproximately 100 victims gave impact statements at a marathon sentencing hearing for Dr. Larry Nassar.

Reuters; Getty Images\n\nNassar was the team doctor for USA Gymnastics for two decades and had a busy sports medicine practice at Michigan State University \u2014 and both institutions have been shaken by criticism of how they handled allegations against him before they became public.\n\nAn investigation by the Indianapolis Star in the September 2016 first disclosed Nassar had been accused by two former patients of sexually assaulting them under the guise of medical treatments, penetrating them with ungloved hands without their permission.\n\nThat unleashed a flood of horrifyingly similar allegations. Nassar pleaded not guilty and his lawyers insisted his procedures were legitimate, but most of his defenders vanished after the child pornography was found \u2014 and he ultimately changed all his pleas.\n\nA year later, some of the most famous names in gymnastics were added to the list: McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas from the 2012 \"Fierce Five\" Olympics team. Simone Biles, who won gold in 2016, said last week that she also had been abused by Nassar, and Jordyn Wieber of the 2012 team revealed her story at the sentencing hearing.\n\nAlthough Nassar admitted he molested seven girls \u2014 including a family friend, starting when she was six \u2014 the judge allowed all accusers to speak before she announced the penalty. She could not have imagined the result: a wall-to-wall outpouring of anger, grief, and demands for accountability from world-famous athletes to unknown teenagers.\n\n\"I feel nauseous even standing in front of you,\" 18-year-old Kaylee Lorincz told Nassar, who sat in the witness box crying. \"Like the feeling as if I'm being assaulted by you all over again.\"\n\nLorincz, who said she was 13 when her innocence was stolen, told Nassar she didn't need an apology. What she and the other victims wanted, she said, was accountability from the institutions that employed him.\n\n\"I only hope that when you get a chance to speak, you tell us who knew what and when they knew it,\" she said. \"If you truly want us to heal, you will do this for us.\"\n\nA day earlier, Brooke Hylek offered another suggest to Nassar.\n\n\"Enjoy hell,\" she said.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174259im_/https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/transparent-placeholder.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174259im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_04/2302816/180123-nassar-hearing-1420_8430dde2151a7027a484b21418fca522.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174259im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_04/2302856/180123-nassar-victims-mn-1500_e509c94fa806988444a811598416ffc4.nbcnews-ux-1024-900.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174259im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_04/2304076/180124-larry-nassar-se-1219p_9ef4fa26f714c88a26d438bb5cacac56.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174259im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_04/2304076/180124-larry-nassar-se-1219p_9ef4fa26f714c88a26d438bb5cacac56.nbcnews-ux-1024-900.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174259im_/https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/today-logo-site-nav.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174259im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_04/2302856/180123-nassar-victims-mn-1500_e509c94fa806988444a811598416ffc4.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174259im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_04/2302816/180123-nassar-hearing-1420_8430dde2151a7027a484b21418fca522.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tracy Connor"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174259/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gymnastics-doctor-larry-nassar-sentenced-175-years-sex-abuse-n840341", "title": "Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar sentenced to up to 175 years for sex abuse", "meta_data": {"description": "Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said she did not believe the apology that Larry Nassar gave his sex-abuse victims. \"I signed your death warrant,\" said Aquilina.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said she did not believe the apology that Larry Nassar gave his sex-abuse victims. \"I signed your death warrant,\" said Aquilina.", "title": "Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar sentenced to up to 175 years for sex abuse", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174259/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gymnastics-doctor-larry-nassar-sentenced-175-years-sex-abuse-n840341", "type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174259im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_04/2302816/180123-nassar-hearing-1420_8430dde2151a7027a484b21418fca522.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "NBCNews", "title": "Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar sentenced to up to 175 years for sex abuse", "description": "Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said she did not believe the apology that Larry Nassar gave his sex-abuse victims. \"I signed your death warrant,\" said Aquilina.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180124174259im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_04/2302816/180123-nassar-hearing-1420_8430dde2151a7027a484b21418fca522.nbcnews-fp-1024-512.jpg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/gymnastics-doctor-larry-nassar-sentenced-175-years-sex-abuse-n840341", "google-site-verification": "G4SGIUDh2TcgDVNjuleQ-Humwb3JAZaQD9Vg42Stfn8", "news_keywords": "News,Crime & Courts,Olympics,Sports,U.S. news", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/tracyconnoratnbc"}, "DC.date.issued": "2018-01-24", "published": "2018-01-24T17:41:07.000Z", "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
