I told him how much I loved him, and with a few tears and a crack in my voice, I gave him the ring and asked him to marry me. Lucky for me, he said yes!\u201d\n\nCourtesy Cody Alan\n\nCountry music brought Alan and Smith, an occupational therapist, together in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe met at a Carrie Underwood concert I was hosting,\u201d Alan recalls. \u201cCarrie, she\u2019s like cupid to us \u2014 but with much better legs!\u201d\n\nThe couple got more serious in 2016; this January, Alan came out exclusively to PEOPLE; and ever since, the pair have stepped out publicly together, walking the red carpet at the ACMs in April then the CMT Awards in June.\n\nAlan has two teenage children \u2014 a daughter and son \u2014 from his marriage to his ex-wife, and Smith immediately took to his family.\n\n\u201cNot to be too clich\u00e9, but I knew he was the one by the way he loved my kids,\u201d says Alan.\n\n\u201cBeing a father already, my children were the most important factor in my deciding to get married again. Plus, Trea and I always have the most fun together. In a very real sense, he\u2019s helped open my eyes to what it means to have true joy in life; and that he is open to share that love and joy with my children meant the world to me,\u201d he added.\n\nAlan hasn\u2019t started planning their big day yet. But the iHeartRadio star knows this wedding will be different from his first.\n\n\u201cNo one will be in a dress, for starters!\u201d he quips. \u201cWe\u2019re both simple guys, so I\u2019m not sure it will be lavish \u2026 but we certainly want to share it with all those who\u2019ve loved and supported us on our journey.\u201d\n\nMichael Loccisano/Getty Images For CMT\n\nAs for what Alan is looking forward to most in marriage?\n\n\u201cHis and his bathroom sinks!\u201d he says.\n\nMore seriously: \u201cEveryone wants to find true love and make it last,\u201d Alan adds. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been intensely loyal to each other, and to now fully commit ourselves to a lifetime relationship is the greatest. Trea is amazing, and I\u2019m looking forward to our new adventures.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/ImaJ7xbYThyQut2DyB9kYrBclEg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/jana-kramer-3-052523-327c6e4951c748499f96c41d0eec0c86.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/dIubq__WEWwdvMGGcmxrrWGdI6Y=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/rupert-murdoch-ann-lesley-smith-032023-1-efd87ac0321a4a82a74d1e3af5debc0d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0VBtunC3cDWSK2Ha0LI8IOiGxdg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kelsea-ballerini-kane-brown-033023-2-4e52b0a8ee824b3eb137726063bc86d6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/doQ4rVAEQ2mK9k7mei5-KwnYoNc=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jeff-Nelson_selects-10-85889a30a8544ebba85c86033bc5b46a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9opjsPr3ODHJy73Z2HZz95OxEkQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/mattiejacksonwedding05232023-11-655fcaf1c1b34378884e8c24c9b555a4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/5eT437Azk8X687JOe-QSif9ax8w=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x642:1021x644)/tim-mcgraw-faith-hill-1-b271c98a4f564b1981f320816e924d76.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1nsg-vm1xTb89Eqsll3GijTXFA4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(644x119:646x121)/cole-swindell-engagement-050823-tout-ea1f8650bd1548f299cff8b1d418cb2e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/G3d0UQYfov1xdXfj_UGQ-cU6jCY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x309:751x311)/Cole-Swindell-Courtney-Little-engaged-01-051123-3a9b4bd3ab604edda3cf0bbb6e342f10.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/p59pCo344i0_rNdqBqhEEvBxyQM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(319x0:321x2)/people_social_image-60e0c8af9eb14624a5b55f2c29dbe25b.png", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/gu0iG64KOEV8RcRJSoEbBXwODMQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1079x509:1081x511)/dean-ulgert-caelynn-miller-keyes-1-71d04e31665442d1a31d0ecbb4c65f2b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/CBSAVJwLyX5bsHOHp1PErhKUN7Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(494x249:496x251)/CMT-WINNERS-LIST-01-2023-5e43bed6555d4ba6bb3adafeb0e7fc5c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/PzTlags4vW0UpbeKIvu83PYOQXw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(735x0:737x2)/cody-alan-2-5ab8187bedcb4353884902af8d2d73af.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/G2esxmvW2HsA-QbD8HQP48tcqeA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x704:981x706)/gabby-barret-cade-foehners-1-93de8f9234604b44968d9e898f129c69.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/6mD7bV3tTmJcAT2wxrq0AaZH0NI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(779x319:781x321)/Cole-Swindell-Courtney-Little-engaged-04-051123-46517031df8a4799805472400ad00560.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/H1zRDvdJ8090QFsh8GFVsj0Tehc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(687x412:689x414)/jana-kramer-052523-48da0acc842443e98779642377217204.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZtnVVL2n2gFX8W7U7H0kWG8Gf1A=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1039x449:1041x451)/avril-lavigne-dating-history-tout-1-694023b5a74c4269b352b847b15147e9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/MDH5tp_5DQ0iRyL9SGQy4fnNKA0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(655x417:657x419)/brody-jenner-tia-blanco-engagement-061923-1-adf85ccb05874d31ab5bfd932ae7498a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/uN2kIpuwe48CgxzeiC4i1A3D6Kg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(647x0:649x2)/cody-alan-2000-400f08716fc646d8975427e0bcd99c17.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/x71jWrcEDK9p8lWq7MFbkNp3_v4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/lainey-wilson-kane-brown-carrie-underwood-030723-431cbc0896d24f7b9db64cad6d173540.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/p59pCo344i0_rNdqBqhEEvBxyQM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(319x0:321x2)/people_social_image-60e0c8af9eb14624a5b55f2c29dbe25b.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeff Nelson", "Jeff Nelson Is The Senior Music Editor At People.
