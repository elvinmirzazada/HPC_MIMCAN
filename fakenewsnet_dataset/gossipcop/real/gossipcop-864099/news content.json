During an interview with The Edit published on Thursday, June 29, the actress, who suffered an eating disorder herself in the past, said that people\u2019s obsession with being thin is why the disease exists.\n\nRelated: Celebrities\u2019 Weight Loss and Transformations: Before and After Pictures Shocking, indeed!

I want to know what you\u2019re doing, you look great!\u2019 I got into the car with my mom and said, \u2018That is why the problem exists.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe role hit home for Collins, who previously revealed that she suffered an eating disorder.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a scene where I\u2019m taking my clothes off to be weighed by Carrie Preston, my stepmom in the movie, who takes a photo on her phone and shows it to me. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d actually take one but she did,\u201d Collins recalled. \u201cI saw myself in the photo and my heart dropped. So when my mom saw the film, she saw Lily\u2019s reaction because she knows me the best.\u201d\n\nThe scene caused her mom to breakdown.\n\nRelated: Movie Makeovers: Memorable Drab to Fab Character Transformations Look back at memorable movie makeovers, from Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady to Olivia Newton-John in Grease, to Anne Hathaway in The Princess Diaries\n\n\u201cThe first time she was a bit in shock,\u201d Collins added of her mom\u2019s reaction. \u201cThe second time I looked over at the end and she was sobbing; it really hit her hard.\u201d\n\nThe Love, Rosie actress also told The Edit that she couldn\u2019t book photoshoots in magazines because she was too skinny.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Workout Buddies Friendship and fitness! Celebs are just like Us \u2014 they\u2019d rather stay in shape with the help of their friends or significant others.

Reese Witherspoon, for example, goes on hikes with her [\u2026]\n\n\u201cI told my publicist that if I could snap my fingers and gain 10 pounds right that second, I would,\u201d she concluded of the experience.\n\nThank You!
