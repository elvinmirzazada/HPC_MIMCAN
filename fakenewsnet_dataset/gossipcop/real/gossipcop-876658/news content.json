That\u2019s according to People, which says that Bullock released a brief statement saying that she hopes we can rise above the current political climate and join together to help those in need. \u201cThere are no politics in eight feet of water,\u201d she says, \u201cthere are human beings in eight feet of water.\u201d (Bullock presumably missed Donald Trump\u2019s hurricane response, because he seems pretty confident that there\u2019s a ton of politics in eight feet of water.)\n\nAs it turns out, though, this is far from the first time that Bullock has used her superstar status to help people in need. As noted by E! News, Bullock has donated more than $5 million to charities and people in need over the years, including $1 million to 9/11 relief efforts, $1 million to help victims of the tsunami in Indonesia in 2004, and another $1 million to the Red Cross after Hurricane Katrina. The story notes that Bullock doesn\u2019t do it for attention, which is why she\u2019s usually quiet about it, and in a statement Bullock says \u201cwe have to take care of one another\u201d and that she\u2019s \u201cjust grateful\u201d she can do it.", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.avclub.com/sandra-bullock-maintains-disaster-donation-streak-give-1798636029", "title": "Sandra Bullock has been quietly donating $1 million every time there's a disaster", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "QDPLbDJXTQNT0n69mvNADCeRmwnbkYyL20OKJAVCKq8", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW, max-image-preview:large", "description": "A lot of people and organizations have been chipping in to help the Hurricane Harvey relief efforts in Texas, and one particularly charitable famous person is Sandra Bullock, who recently donated $1 million to the American Red Cross.
