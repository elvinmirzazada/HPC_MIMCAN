But for those in the know, the much-anticipated WrestleMania 34 was like the Super Bowl meets the Oscars meets Christmas morning. The seven-hour event at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans produced plenty of action and surprises, and naturally, a few memorable moments turned into social media memes.\n\nPerhaps the funniest meme came from John Cena. The WWE star was sitting in the crowd in civilian clothes when a uniformed official whispered something in his ear (NOT STAGED AT ALL), and suddenly Cena was off like a prom dress.\n\nFans had many ideas as to why Cena was running, and the snarky captions flew.\n\nNo oven timer, no Infinity War screening (we've got a new TV spot, though). Instead, Cena was racing to a match with the out-of-retirement, 53-year-old Undertaker. And in just a few minutes, the Undertaker undertook to take him under.\n\nIn other matches of note, Ronda Rousey, former UFC women's bantamweight champ, made her WWE debut with a tribute to the style of her idol, the late \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper.\n\nRousey and partner Kurt Angle defeated Stephanie McMahon and Triple H. CBS Sports dubbed Rousey \"WWE's newest full-time superstar,\" and fans had plenty to say, too.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest reaction of the night came when Daniel Bryan made his WWE return after battling years of injuries and health problems. Is Bryan back? One word for that:", "images": ["https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/4a2d5e639e8281b96b067d4332d16fb2ddbf8ab8/hub/2016/05/02/85948f9b-7918-477c-840f-eb31523e2b20/gaelcropped2.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=84&width=84", "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/d9515f2c4384bc3d2911766654146a5d3950dfca/hub/2016/05/02/85948f9b-7918-477c-840f-eb31523e2b20/gaelcropped2.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=96&width=96", "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/26296a5c9bd1a521a2e39234ab0c143435555dde/hub/2018/04/09/449ee844-722b-42b4-bcb3-eb6be065705c/johncenawrestlemania34.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200"], "top_img": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/26296a5c9bd1a521a2e39234ab0c143435555dde/hub/2018/04/09/449ee844-722b-42b4-bcb3-eb6be065705c/johncenawrestlemania34.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gael Fashingbauer Cooper", "Cnet Freelancer Gael Fashingbauer Cooper", "A Journalist", "Pop-Culture Junkie", "Is Co-Author Of", "Whatever Happened To Pudding Pops", "The Lost Toys", "Tastes", "Trends Of The", "As Well As"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnet.com/culture/sports/wwe-wrestlemania-34-memes-of-john-cena-daniel-bryan-ronda-rousey/", "title": "Wrestlemania 34 memes: Ronda Rousey, Daniel Bryan rule", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnet"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001036810388, "app_id": 16995676698, "pages": 7155422274}, "google-site-verification": "wNWLoFvk5wsdZQ-u75uCNiaHNa7FLFmNtH2t7dZbXmQ", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.cnet.com/", "msapplication-task": "name=Videos; action-uri=https://www.cnet.com/videos/; icon-uri=https://www.cnet.com/favicon-v3.ico", "msapplication-tooltip": "Product reviews and prices, software downloads, and tech news - CNET", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "p": {"domain_verify": "47524839a64b83c951afca9ef6c838e0"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 30261067, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNET", "creator": "@CNET", "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/26296a5c9bd1a521a2e39234ab0c143435555dde/hub/2018/04/09/449ee844-722b-42b4-bcb3-eb6be065705c/johncenawrestlemania34.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "description": "Bryan's WrestleMania 34 comeback sent fans into overdrive, and Rousey doesn't miss MMA.
