But a lesser-known Davis-Crawford battle followed\u2014on the set of another Bob Aldrich\u2013directed psycho-thriller, *Hush. . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte.\u201d And on Sunday night\u2019s episode of Feud, \u201cAbandoned,\u201d Ryan Murphy revealed how Davis masterminded her own sadistic revenge on her once-again co-star.\n\nUnderstandably, the actresses were reluctant to re-team given their history. Before signing onto the film, Crawford demanded her name be billed first; to get Davis on board, Aldrich made a series of sizable concessions including a $200,000 paycheck\u2014the same fee Aldrich was receiving\u2014and his word that Davis would be an associate producer on the picture. However, during pre-production, Davis felt Aldrich was ignoring her input and fired off a firmly worded eight-page letter threatening to quit.\n\n\u201cYou do not function well with someone of my type,\u201d Davis wrote Aldrich, according to Shaun Considine\u2019s Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud\u2014an absolute must-read for fans of the FX series. \u201cThat was obvious throughout the filming of Baby Jane\u2014and the suicidal desire this put me into many times, was almost more than I was able to bear. . . I do not wear well with tricks designed to make me do what someone else decides I will do.\u201d\n\nShe ended by suggesting Aldrich \u201cre-cast and pay me off. It will be cheaper in the long run.\u201d\n\nThis maneuver explains how Davis found herself sitting at Aldrich\u2019s side throughout filming, why Aldrich obliged Davis\u2019s creative input, and how Davis secured the leverage to properly torture Crawford.\n\nAlthough certain moments in \u201cAbandoned\u201d feel exaggerated for dramatic effect\u2014like Crawford being made to wait for her hotel room, and then being stuck in a room next to the garbage disposal\u2014the episode\u2019s writers actually skimped on the insane details of what actually happened.\n\nFor example, according to Shaun Considine\u2019s Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud, Crawford arrived at the Baton Rouge airport with a full entourage\u2014including her hairdresser, makeup artist, and enough baggage to . . . well, let Davis explain:\n\n\u201cFor a goddamn week in Baton Rouge, she brought twenty pieces of luggage. It was a black-and-white movie but she had color-coordinated outfits for the daytime scenes, and for the night shots all of her evening dresses were chiffon, which meant that the wardrobe lady had to spend hours ironing them in the one-hundred-degree weather.\u201d\n\nWhen Crawford arrived to set the fourth day of filming, Davis had already tactically befriended the local press and crew\u2014the latter of whom she would eat lunch with. George Cukor later reflected on Davis\u2019s stone-cold set strategy: \u201cShe wanted to make a basket case out of Joan, and she almost succeeded.\u201d", "images":
