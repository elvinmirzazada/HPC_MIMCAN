Terry Dubrow and Paul Nassif to give her equally large butt implants.\n\n\u201cWhen she came in I thought, \u2018Why would someone want to do this to their body and have something so heavy on the front of their chest that could damage them?\u2019 \u201d Nassif, 55, tells PEOPLE. \u201cI still ponder what gets in people\u2019s minds and souls, why they do the things they do. Her breasts stuck out about two feet. That means her butt would be more like a cartoon character because it would have to stick out two feet.\u201d\n\nNassif says butt implants can result in issues, even when they aren\u2019t extremely large.\n\n\u201cThere can be malposition or a functional problem, and there\u2019s risk of infection or breakdown of the skin,\u201d he explains. \u201cSomething that big, if you put it in there, it\u2019s going to cause a problem. It\u2019s not reasonable.\u201d\n\nDubrow, 58, says Big is just one of the patients on season 4 of Botched who has undergone extreme plastic surgery before coming to meet with them.\n\n\u201cThis season we explore the extremely out-there periphery of body modification surgery,\u201d he tells PEOPLE. \u201cThis season is so completely different than the seasons we\u2019ve had before. We took on cases that seemed impossible and we had some significant complications of our own. It was a riskier, scarier season, and we made some people worse before better. It was an anxiety-producing season for both Paul and I. We ran into some serious stuff.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: How Kim Kardashian Is Affecting Plastic Surgery Trends\n\nEven though the doctors take on riskier patients, they promise this season will feature the amazing before and afters that fans have come to expect of the show.\n\n\u201cSome of the transformations are still absolutely incredible,\u201d says Nassif. \u201cWe\u2019re really changing people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nSeason 4 of Botched premieres Sunday at 9p.m. ET/PT on E!", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/keOKOdlvXfmVATFGGVlfm8XBm9k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/blac-chyna-tamron-hall-033023-8187bf65a1fa46e39f57f03e3104b9d4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/SqNWnd9kDRHOlV4aJG1aficQZ80=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/sharon-stone-an-unforgettable-evening-benefiting-the-womens-cancer-research-fund-031723-1-c8fda2f8f1fc4e2b99b5fa0f118f9a05.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0EIw9W5h5F8MD0JGDENzIFb2oF0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(794x459:796x461)/Blac-Chyna-Instagram-01-031323-ead04a48b0544bceaa0f878a2df8d25d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/5DQxR_ksnFwPpOtEbUdw4hC0r38=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(705x123:707x125)/Pregnant-Influencer-Jackie-Miller-James-in-Medically-Induced-Coma-After-Aneurysm-Rupture-060223-2-1c84a3e68bf8434aa8a4a3551c2783bc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/TDgyij5Dbo50X7VZdPLPAbsjD1M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x332:981x334)/Heather-Dubrow-121522-8267b65114e44d18b1d639d49a9a88b7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9JbqvPRVKGR93BLrstgQBtUK_Bg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/botched-martina-4b455218271a4142b4f62da5ad16e20b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zHZUKb6LmfF_HufCxi9eXjKbm-o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(989x134:991x136)/Philecia-La-Bounty-90-22092022-6200d10e857a4c53a49205ea0c26961e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jFcvcAGIOjIUwFpIA6oPfKptHkE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/heather-dubrow-48th-annual-gracie-awards-052423-1-117991e2fc574417812b180b68b82b46.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Fmk2_o76KVMn4qQUNi8Gz-Tyksc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1034x9:1036x11)/leanne-hainsby-cancer-journey-041223-1-9ea78e38284f4914a2221d48ef2f6f52.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/z0C4NigWlaCRnV0XGUUo-1fMwmA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(639x0:641x2)/roselyn-1-21572d6a55494c9b97a1eed010aab05c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/n7jBaHnA9YLhsgqZm77y7twavU0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/heather-dubrow-kids-2-0994f9b7343f4387a39725ec83609e61.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ekLbdX8OXBdRAW3jy7OTld_9KoU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(479x232:481x234)/rachel-recchia-breast-reduction-030923-tout-7588824fead7417795a6156881f211a7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/MtS9zR9dW4oWnLMteFjrRZaLh-M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(689x339:691x341)/Genevieve-Padalecki-01-040523-87f480645e25430ab102e8ce50cf59f1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/D205eF7whOIwvxP70K7IRqnVw-g=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/priyanka-chopra-jonas-met-solawave-tout-2000-12c967b698404438bd96891dbe20dabe.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/x5VN839-TGqYQENlFLHotdyGeGs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(775x290:777x292)/prenuvo-060823-49fbd61899124422be38ce8bf488c607.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/ANedLnG6LN8e7czdn3V3MscjTDk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Blac-Chyna-Celebrates-1-Year-Anniversary-of-Being-Reborn-032323-1-d0703103866f4ebbb2d7d023848dc877.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/TPIzCQew7Cf54oke-751vwh1hcU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/margaret-josephs-watch-what-hapens-live-040423-1-91c48c945530441292d70be41613df5d.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/9JbqvPRVKGR93BLrstgQBtUK_Bg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/botched-martina-4b455218271a4142b4f62da5ad16e20b.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gabrielle Olya", "Gabrielle Olya Is A Former Staff Writer At People.
