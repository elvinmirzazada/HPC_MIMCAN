And also gaining the trust and respect of the general public, and using the position for good.\"\n\nPrincess Diana, who was known as the \"People's Princess\" and died when Harry was 12, continues to be a major inspiration for the prince.\n\n\"I think she had a lot in common with everybody but also she certainly listened in a very, very short space of time,\" Prince Harry said. \"In society we suffer from this illusion or this reality where some problems get so big that nobody wants to get involved. She was the one that changed that. I will always look up to her as being my ideal role model because everything she did, and the way she did it, was having an impact, was making a difference.\"\n\nEarlier that day, Prince Harry and former first lady Michelle Obama surprised a group of Chicago high school students.\n\nThe two chatted with the teens about the importance of staying inspired and hopeful, and the transformative power of using their voices to change the world.\"\n\nFor more on Prince Harry, watch below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fprince_harry_michelle_obama_kensington.jpg%3Fh%3D3db9a0ab&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-09/gettyimages-1032872888.jpg?h=e2422a06&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fprince_harry_gettyimages_860662668.jpg%3Fh%3D40005b08&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2Fprince_harry_gettyimages-868777938.jpg%3Fh%3Dc9dbdf39&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/prince_harry_gettyimages-868777938.jpg?h=c9dbdf39"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/prince_harry_gettyimages-868777938.jpg?h=c9dbdf39", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/prince-harry-calls-princess-diana-my-ideal-role-model-obama-foundation-summit-90275", "title": "Prince Harry Calls Princess Diana 'My Ideal Role Model' at Obama Foundation Summit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/prince_harry_gettyimages-868777938.jpg?h=c9dbdf39", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 33-year-old royal also spoke about the importance of giving back and how his late mother made a difference.", "title": "Prince Harry Calls Princess Diana 'My Ideal Role Model' at Obama Foundation Summit", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/prince-harry-calls-princess-diana-my-ideal-role-model-obama-foundation-summit-90275", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 33-year-old royal also spoke about the importance of giving back and how his late mother made a difference.", "twitter": {"description": "The 33-year-old royal also spoke about the importance of giving back and how his late mother made a difference.", "title": "Prince Harry Calls Princess Diana 'My Ideal Role Model' at Obama Foundation Summit", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/prince-harry-calls-princess-diana-my-ideal-role-model-obama-foundation-summit-90275", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/prince_harry_gettyimages-868777938.jpg?h=c9dbdf39", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Prince Harry Calls Princess Diana 'My Ideal Role Model' at Obama Foundation Summit  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Prince Harry", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
