I\u2019ve never felt so tranquil and happy,\u201d Musgraves, who wore a Berta wedding dress, wrote on Instagram Tuesday morning, sharing photos from the wedding.\n\n\u201cWe made our promises to each other under the trees and then drank and danced into the night. We couldn\u2019t have done any of it without the help of our wonderful families and amazing friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best kind of magic. Best day of my life,\u201d added her folk singer/songwriter husband, captioning a set of photos of himself with his new wife.\n\nnatalie with nbarrett photography\n\nnatalie with nbarrett photography\n\nnatalie with nbarrett photography\n\nnatalie with nbarrett photography\n\nnatalie with nbarrett photography\n\nAhead of the wedding Musgraves teased the celebration on Twitter, writing \u201cToday,\u201d followed by a bride emoji and hearts. Meanwhile Kelly wrote, \u201cLast night as a bachelor. Finally ready to throw in that towel cuz I actually found the real thing. Couldn\u2019t be more proud to have all our family and friends here to honor this new badass union.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BaN26NrAL1l/?hl=en&taken-by=rustonkelly\n\nThe musicians were first linked together in 2016, and got engaged last Christmas Eve. Musgraves broke the exciting engagement news on Instagram, writing, \u201cI didn\u2019t say yes\u2026I said HELL YESSSS!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cLast night the best man I\u2019ve ever met got down on one knee in my little pink childhood home,\u201d Musgraves added alongside a photo of her ring in front of the Christmas tree. \u201cIn the same room I played with my ponies and barbies and asked me the easiest question I\u2019ve ever been asked. I finally know what everyone means when they say, \u2018You just know.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe \u201cBlack Magic\u201d singer also shared the engagement news in his own Instagram photo showing Musgraves\u2019 ring: \u201cI have never met a more incredible partner and woman. Last night I became the luckiest, proudest and happiest man ever. I asked the brightest light in my life to marry me.\u201d\n\nThe happy couple packed on the PDA the following Valentine\u2019s Day, celebrating their engagement by wearing matching green gingham outfits.\n\n\u201cEvery day is Valentine\u2019s Day with you,\u201d Musgraves wrote alongside an Instagram photo of herself and Kelly kissing. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I get to marry my best friend! Your love can get me through anything.\u201d\n\nSharing the same grateful sentiment, Kelly wrote: \u201cValentine\u2019s Day sucks unless you have the right one. Aside from the chocolate and roses and other saccharine elements of this holiday, it\u2019s really just a day to reflect gratitude for the great love in your life.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kacey Musgraves Talks the Tough Christmas Decisions\n\nIn July, Musgraves celebrated her bachelorette party with \u201cfanny packs / fireworks / drinking games / dollywood / bedazzled bandanas / bubbles / cookies / candle making / rainbows / roller coasters [that nearly made me have a stroke] and the best woman on Earth nestled in a cabin in the mountains celebrating me finding the love of my life,\u201d she wrote on Instagram alongside a montage of photos and videos from the festivities.\n\nMost recently, the pair celebrated their wedding shower just weeks before the big day.", "images":
