We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don\u2019t agree with everything anyone does. That\u2019s what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.\u201d\n\nBAHE / BACKGRID\n\nHe continued, \u201cIf your friend jumps off the bridge you don\u2019t have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people in my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don\u2019t tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary I love Hillary too.\u201d\n\nWest later tweeted a closeup photo of his MAGA hat signed by Trump with over 30 fire emojis, writing \u201cmy MAGA hat is signed.\u201d\n\nA short while later, West said that he had spoken to his wife Kim Kardashian West about his previous tweets.\n\n\u201cMy wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with everything Trump does. I don\u2019t agree 100% with anyone but myself.\u201d\n\nTrump later responded to West, tweeting \u201cThank you Kanye, very cool!\u201d\n\nA source told PEOPLE on Wednesday the rapper wasn\u2019t concerned with people\u2019s opinions on his political views.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s actually not as upset as you\u2019d think about what\u2019s being said,\u201d a source close to West said. \u201cHe just thinks that no one gets his genius.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe hated the word erratic, but he likes to say that genius is erratic,\u201d the insider continues, referencing the term a different source close to West used to describe him. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a genius if you\u2019re not erratic in some way. So it\u2019s not wrong, but he thinks it\u2019s more than being erratic.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s friend, John Legend, seemed to take issue with the rapper\u2019s tweets supporting Trump. He shared a series of cryptic Twitter posts in which he spoke of oppression continuing in the country.\n\n\u201cI love that great, brilliant artists have the power to imagine a better future. But artists can\u2019t be blind to the truth,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cThe defining trait of Trump\u2019s campaign and political profile was his embrace of white supremacy. He made it clear every time he spoke,\u201d he added. \u201cSome serious cognitive dissonance to ignore that for the other x% you might find appealing. I guess I agree with >1% of anyone\u2019s thoughts though.\u201d\n\nChance the Rapper also shared that he had spoken to West \u201ctwo days ago\u201d and adding that \u201che\u2019s in a great space.\u201d\n\nOn the subject of West\u2019s support for Trump, the Grammy-winning rapper tweeted, \u201cBlack people don\u2019t have to be democrats,\u201d and \u201cNext President gon be independent.\u201d\n\nThis week, multiple sources told PEOPLE that West, 40, had cut off contact with several people in his inner circle, including his managers, lawyers and closest friends. The rapper confirmed he stopped working with a manager on Wednesday morning, tweeting, \u201cI no longer have a manager. I can\u2019t be managed.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Kardashian Can\u2019t \u2018Control\u2019 Him: Sources\n\nThe Keeping Up with the Kardashians star also addressed her husband\u2019s tweets on Trump, writing, \u201cWhen he spoke out about Trump\u2026 Most people (including myself) have very different feelings & opinions about this.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is HIS opinion,\u201d she continued. \u201cI believe in people being able to have their own opinions, even if really different from mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe never said he agrees with his politics,\u201d she added.", "images":
