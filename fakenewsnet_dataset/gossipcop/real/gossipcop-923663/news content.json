The real Sudan died last week. During his time alone with Sudan, Deapool wonders why his animated series was canceled, asking, \"What? The Marvel stuff I said in it? All I said was Marvel was trying to sell toys to seven-year-old boys and 50-year-old pedophiles.\"\n\nDeadpool continues, confessing that it might not be a good time to have a \"violent, gun loving white man ranting on TV.\" \"Do you think they canceled the show...cause of racism?!\" he asks. \"All the writers were black. And the references were pretty black, too. I heard they went over the lunch budget ordering Jamaican food at least once a week.\"\n\n\"It just feels like everyone wants something different, but no one wants to do anything different to get it. Doesn't Marvel have enough feel-good minority shows everyone supports but doesn't watch?\" Deadpool says. \"I mean, I think our show woulda been funny. I just wanted a place to be honest. And I guess that place is Freeform.\"\n\nWhile speaking with ET last August, Stephen said that the animated Deadpool series would include \u201csome ideas that are too crazy for Atlanta. It will be a good time.\u201d\n\nRead the script below:\n\nSee more on Donald Glover in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2FGettyImages-911985214.jpg%3Fh%3Db96fb252&w=1024&q=100", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fet_donaldglover_022018.jpg%3Fh%3Dd1cb525d&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fgettyimages-911503094.jpg%3Fh%3D1094b2f8&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fdonald_glover_getty_901646650.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/GettyImages-911985214.jpg?h=b96fb252"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/GettyImages-911985214.jpg?h=b96fb252", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/donald-glover-shares-scrapped-deadpool-script-which-claims-sanaa-lathan-bit-beyonce-99258", "title": "Donald Glover Shares Scrapped 'Deadpool' Script Which Claims Sanaa Lathan Bit Beyonce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/GettyImages-911985214.jpg?h=b96fb252", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The Emmy winner parted ways with the animated series over the weekend, but 'wasn't too busy' to share his 15-page script.", "title": "Donald Glover Shares Scrapped 'Deadpool' Script Which Claims Sanaa Lathan Bit Beyonce", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/donald-glover-shares-scrapped-deadpool-script-which-claims-sanaa-lathan-bit-beyonce-99258", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The Emmy winner parted ways with the animated series over the weekend, but 'wasn't too busy' to share his 15-page script.", "twitter": {"description": "The Emmy winner parted ways with the animated series over the weekend, but 'wasn't too busy' to share his 15-page script.", "title": "Donald Glover Shares Scrapped 'Deadpool' Script Which Claims Sanaa Lathan Bit Beyonce", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/donald-glover-shares-scrapped-deadpool-script-which-claims-sanaa-lathan-bit-beyonce-99258", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/GettyImages-911985214.jpg?h=b96fb252", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Donald Glover Shares Scrapped 'Deadpool' Script Which Claims Sanaa Lathan Bit Beyonce | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Donald Glover, Beyonce, Deadpool", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
