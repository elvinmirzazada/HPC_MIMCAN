I heard this song a lot, I\u2019ve never attempted to sing it because I have a huge amount of respect for the guy who did it originally,\u201d Young said on stage. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to give it my best. Music can heal.\u201d\n\nScott Legato/Getty\n\nYoung decided against canceling the performance in the hope he could continue to heal and help others do the same.\n\n\u201cI hugged my family and talked about what I was going to do this week as far as this show that I am going to play tonight,\u201d he said in a video shared on Twitter and Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m a musician and music can heal so I\u2019m hoping this is a night of trying to do that for a lot of people that are here.\u201d\n\nRELATED GALLERY: Remembering the Victims of the Las Vegas Mass Shooting\n\nThe four-time ACM Awards nominee did not perform at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, but he was standing offstage during Jason Aldean\u2018s set when gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from his 32nd-floor hotel room at the Mandalay Bay casino on the crowd of more than 22,000 people. 58 were killed and over 500 were injured.\n\nYoung, who has been touring with Aldean, fled for his life when the shooting began and tweeted Sunday: \u201cSpent I don\u2019t know how long on the floor of a trailer behind the stage \u2026 know multiple people are dead. Listening to that gunfire I\u2019m literally shaking still.\u201d\n\nAldean, 40, announced on Tuesday that he chose to cancel his series of concerts this weekend \u201cout of respect for the victims, their families, and our fans.\u201d He was scheduled to perform Friday at Los Angeles, Saturday in San Diego and Sunday in Anaheim.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: 58 Killed, 515 Injured at Jason Aldean\u2019s Las Vegas Concert \u2014 Deadliest Mass Shooting in U.S. History\n\nHow to Help and Learn About Loved Ones\n\nFriends and family are asked to report missing people believed to be connected to the shooting using the hotline 1-800-536-9488.\n\nAnyone with photo or video evidence of the shooting is asked to call 1-800-CALL-FBI.\n\nThe city of Las Vegas has established a Family Reunification Center to help connect relatives with the more than 500 people who were injured.\n\nIn addition, city officials urged those locally who wish to donate blood to visit one of two donation centers operated by United Blood Services, either at 6930 W.
