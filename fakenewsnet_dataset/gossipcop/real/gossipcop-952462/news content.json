It\u2019s a brave and honest decision by her, and everyone is rallying around her and wants the best for her,\u201d Frankel explains.\n\nBravo confirmed that she is not taping the season 10 reunion.\n\n\u201cBravo supports Luann\u2019s decision to focus on her health,\u201d the network said in a statement to PEOPLE. \u201cShe is part of the Bravo family and we continue to stand by her as she copes with this challenging situation. At this time, we hope everyone will respect her privacy.\u201d\n\nFrankel explains that de Lesseps made the decision because she wants to look to the future.\n\nRecently, de Lesseps had enjoyed a string of sold-out cabaret performances \u2014 #CountessAndFriends at New York City\u2019s Feinstein\u2019s/54 Below \u2014 for which she received glowing reviews.\n\n\u201cLuann loves doing the cabaret,\u201d Frankel says about the reality star, whose goal is to return to the stage as soon as possible. \u201cShe\u2019s taking the necessary steps to get better so that the show can go on.\u201d\n\nHer decision to return to rehab comes days after news broke that her first husband, Alexandre de Lesseps, her daughter, Victoria de Lesseps, and son, Noel de Lesseps, filed a lawsuit against her over an $8 million house sale. According to court documents obtained by The Blast, she breached a stipulation of settlement in her divorce by failing to create a trust \u201cfor the benefit of her two children.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecent additional family stress was a catalyst to her taking a break,\u201d Frankel says.\n\nDe Lesseps\u2019 first trip to rehab occurred after her headline-making arrest in December.\n\nShe was arrested in the early morning hours of Dec. 24 and released on her own recognizance that same day after allegedly attacking a police officer in Palm Beach.\n\nShe was charged with and pleaded not guilty to disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer/firefighter/EMT, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office. (She\u2019s since pleaded not guilty and rejected a plea deal in February.)\n\nThe reality star had been discovered trespassing in a hotel room with an unidentified man, according to a police report. The pair had allegedly entered the wrong room at the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach and refused to leave. Police say de Lesseps slammed a door and kicked at least one officer. She also allegedly told the police, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you all.\u201d\n\nRob Kim/WireImage for Life & Style\n\nAfter her arrest, de Lesseps \u2014 who had gotten married to ex-husband Tom D\u2019Agostino in Palm Beach on last New Year\u2019s Eve before their divorce seven months later \u2014 released a statement, saying, \u201cThis was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding, and being here brought up long-buried emotions. I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I might have offended with my behavior. I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the events \u2026 in Palm Beach, I am truly embarrassed,\u201d de Lesseps said in a statement to PEOPLE as she checked herself into treatment. \u201cI have decided to seek professional guidance and will be voluntarily checking into an alcohol treatment center. I intend to turn this unfortunate incident into a positive life-changing event. Once again, I sincerely apologize for my actions. I have the greatest respect for police officers and the job they do. My actions alleged in the police report do not reflect my core values and my law-abiding character.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so grateful for the love and support that I am receiving from my family, friends and loyal supporters,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u2014 with Jodi Guglielmi and Natalie Stone", "images":
