When she asked why, she said she was told it was because she wasn't enough of a \"bitch.\"\n\nSteenhoek was a producer on Fletcher's season of \"The Bachelorette.\" ABC\n\nSteenhoek is now suing Warner Bros., \"Bachelor\" creator Mike Fleiss' production company NZK Productions, as well as producers Elan Gale, Peter Scalettar, Jacqueline Naz Perez, Bennett Graebner, and Stapleton for \"damages related to sexual harassment and hostile work environment, sex discrimination, retaliation, failure to prevent harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and wrongful termination,\" according to the LA Times.\n\nIn a statement to INSIDER, Warner Bros. said it had previously investigated Steenhoek's claims and didn't feel their findings supported her claims. Read the full statement below:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We take all allegations of workplace harassment very seriously. These allegations were brought to our attention and were thoroughly investigated earlier this year. Our findings did not support the plaintiff\u2019s characterization of the events claimed to have taken place, which is why we are disappointed by the filing of this lawsuit.\"\n\nSteenhoek's lawsuit comes at a time when powerful industry players in Hollywood like producer Harvey Weinstein or director James Toback are being accused of sexual harassment. And it's not just in Hollywood \u2014 many powerful men are now being accused of sexual misconduct, including Ben Affleck and Kevin Spacey.", "images":
