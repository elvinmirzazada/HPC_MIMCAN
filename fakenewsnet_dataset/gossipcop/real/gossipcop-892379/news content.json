Even the Duchess of Cambridge had a hard time seeing her son off to nursery school. Kate Middleton admitted that she\u2019s still getting used to dropping Prince George off at school and mom, we feel you.\n\nDue to her suffering with hyperemesis gravidarum, severe morning sickness caused by her current pregnancy, Middleton was unable to attend Prince George\u2019s first day of school drop-off with her husband, Prince William. But thankfully, Middleton is overcoming her sickness and is now able to partake in the daily routine.\n\nDuring her speech at the Place2Be School Leaders Forum, Middleton stated, \u201cAs a mother just getting used to leaving my own child at the school gates, it is clear to me that it takes a whole community to help raise a child.\u201d\n\nAccording to E! News, the Duchess attended the forum in order to talk about how schools can get more involved with mental health initiatives \u2014 which is something Middleton, Prince William, and Prince Harry are all advocates for via their Heads Together campaign.\n\n\u201cWhether we are school leaders, teachers, support staff or parents \u2014 we are all in this together,\u201d Middleton continued. \u201cWe are all working to give children the emotional strength they need to face their future lives and thrive.\u201d\n\nWatch The Duchess of Cambridge speak at the @Place2Be School Leaders Forum. pic.twitter.com/HRQlrJVHD1 \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) November 8, 2017\n\nPrince George started full-time nursery school at Thomas\u2019s Battersea in September.
