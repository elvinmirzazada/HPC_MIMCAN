And while the singer has oscillated between different tones of blonde throughout her career, she\u2019s stayed true to her natural texture. But now we have the secret to how she gets that enviably perfect curl pattern thanks to a handful of Instagram selfies shared on celebrity stylist Cynthia Alvarez\u2019s feed.\n\nRelated: Stars Without Makeup: See Stars Going Makeup-Free and Loving It! See these celebrities who look radiant even without makeup!\n\nThe She Wolf took a snapshot of her golden coils drying with colored hair clips strategically placed down the length to perfectly set their pattern as they dry. While it was an in-process shot, as Alvarez points out in her caption, the colorful clips also provide a reference to Solange\u2019s iconic imagery with pins in her locks from her song \u201cDon\u2019t Touch My Hair.\u201d\n\nAnother secret: once the curls have dried, Alvarez goes back in with a small curling iron and individually amps up the coils for that iconic Shakira bodacious head of spirals that she can toss around while she performs during her El Dorado World Tour. We know this because Shakira snapped a video of her stylist extraordinaire showing off a peak into their pre-show ritual.\n\nBut with all of the curls and clips, sometimes things fall through the cracks. In a LOL-worthy moment the singer posted a short video clip backstage mid-performance in which the glam duo is laughing because they\u2019ve realized Shakira had an errant setting clip in her hair for the whole performance up to that point. Hey, at least the singer has a sense of humor about it.\n\nRelated: Stars Without Makeup: See Stars Going Makeup-Free and Loving It!
