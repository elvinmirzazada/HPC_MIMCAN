Going back to the likable thing ... you always see that thing in movies where if a woman is a prostitute or a sex worker, you always think, \u2018I don't want the guys to be grossed out by her,'\" she said. \"We have to still make her kind of sexy ... tragically sexy, but you know, music video.\"\n\n\"If you drive down skid row that's not what you see. That's not the truth,\" she continued. \"So it's really important to us to show a woman who society has written off, and society has forgotten about.\u201d\n\nShe may have gone through a major transformation on screen, but off screen, Lively recently made a big change as well. In October, the star chopped her signature long blonde locks into a \"lob\" (aka long bob), wowing photographers on the red carpet at a screening for her film, All I See is You.\n\nAP\n\nOf course, Lively isn't the only celebrity who's gotten on board with this hair trend for fall.\n\nLast month, Pippa Middleton took a cue from her older sister, Kate, by giving her locks a makeover.
