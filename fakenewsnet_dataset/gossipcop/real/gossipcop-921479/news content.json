And I'm just like my dad.' So I took a look at my life, and I said, 'Something has to change. Something has to change, I've gotta get sober' -- so I did.\"\n\n\"The reason I became so open about my story is I know that there are people here tonight that need to ask for help, and I want you to know that it's OK,\" she continued as the audience cheered. \"Mental health is something that we all need to talk about and we need to take the stigma away from it.\"\n\nAfter her remarks, Lovato went into a gripping rendition of her song, \"Warrior,\" which deals with painful memories from her past. Lovato has penned songs about her troubled family life growing up, with some of the tracks being about her late father, Patrick, who she has at times referred to as \"abusive.\"\n\nWatching Lovato work through her personal struggles has hopefully inspired those who look up to her to do the same.\n\nOne emotional rock for Lovato has been her mom, Dianna Hart. On Saturday, Lovato posted to Instagram a sweet photo of her hugging her mother, writing: \"I love my momma so much #myhero.\"\n\n\"So grateful for another year of joy, health and happiness. It IS possible,\" Lovato tweeted on Wednesday, further celebrating her sixth sober birthday.\n\nET spoke with Lovato just after she reached five years sober last March, and she opened up about keeping clean.\n\n\"What keeps me on this path is there's a drive that I have to stay sober because I know that my life depends on it,\" she reflected. \"If I would have continued down that road, I don't know if I'd be here today.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-03%2Fgettyimages-926589552.jpg%3Fh%3Dbe91a878&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2F1280_demilovato_030118.jpg%3Fh%3D59a3bc86&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2017-11/selena_gomez_876487762.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-12%2Fdemi_lovato_r29.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/1280_gettyimages-926711468.jpg?h=1ec4726a", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-03%2F1280_gettyimages-926711468.jpg%3Fh%3D1ec4726a&w=1024&q=100"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/1280_gettyimages-926711468.jpg?h=1ec4726a", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/demi-lovato-tears-up-on-stage-while-emotionally-reflecting-on-six-years-of-sobriety-watch-98570", "title": "Demi Lovato Tears Up On Stage While Emotionally Reflecting on Six Years of Sobriety -- Watch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/1280_gettyimages-926711468.jpg?h=1ec4726a", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "'Six years ago, I was drinking vodka out of a Sprite bottle at nine in the morning.'", "title": "Demi Lovato Tears Up On Stage While Emotionally Reflecting on Six Years of Sobriety -- Watch", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/demi-lovato-tears-up-on-stage-while-emotionally-reflecting-on-six-years-of-sobriety-watch-98570", "type": "Article"}, "description": "'Six years ago, I was drinking vodka out of a Sprite bottle at nine in the morning.'", "twitter": {"description": "'Six years ago, I was drinking vodka out of a Sprite bottle at nine in the morning.'", "title": "Demi Lovato Tears Up On Stage While Emotionally Reflecting on Six Years of Sobriety -- Watch", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/demi-lovato-tears-up-on-stage-while-emotionally-reflecting-on-six-years-of-sobriety-watch-98570", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/1280_gettyimages-926711468.jpg?h=1ec4726a", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Demi Lovato Tears Up On Stage While Emotionally Reflecting on Six Years of Sobriety -- Watch | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Music, News, Demi Lovato, DJ Khaled", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
