The singer recently told The Cut that her body image influences the way she dresses, which we first read about on StyleCaster.\n\n\"I actually have had the pleasure of a fluctuating body type, where one day I can literally fit into something that is body-con, and then the next day \u2014 the next week \u2014 I need something oversized,\" she told The Cut. \"I need a little crop here and a high-waist there to hide that part, you know?\"\n\nA post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 11, 2017 at 5:37pm PDT\n\n\"I really pay attention every day when I go into the closet about what's working for my body that morning.
