The Brooklyn Animal Rescue Coalition (BARC) disputed her claims that the dog exhibited aggression \u2014 which Dunham later addressed in a second Instagram post.\n\nAntonoff tweeted that \u201cnobody on earth cares for or loved Lamby more than Lena.\u201d\n\nThe musician also said that the dog bit Dunham\u2019s father twice and that they found a trainer who specifically works with aggressive dogs to care for Lamby.\n\nDunham delved into her connection with and love for Lamby despite his aggression and Antonoff\u2019s allergies in a Vogue spread and in an essay for the New Yorker.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "images": ["https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/future-of-covid-19-01.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-566051067.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/newsletter-round.svg", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lena-dunham-dog-controversy.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-566051067.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Marie Segarra"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4850359/jack-antonoff-lena-dunham-dog-lamby-animal-shelter-dispute/", "title": "Jack Antonoff Defends Lena Dunham Amid Dispute With Animal Shelter", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Lena Dunham's boyfriend weighs in on the ongoing dispute between her and a Brooklyn animal shelter over their decision to rehome their dog", "og": {"title": "Jack Antonoff Defends Lena Dunham Amid Dispute With Animal Shelter", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4850359/jack-antonoff-lena-dunham-dog-lamby-animal-shelter-dispute/", "description": "\"Nobody on earth cares for or loved Lamby more than Lena\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-566051067.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "published_time": "2017-07-08T14:49:39.000Z"}, "category": "Entertainment", "primary_tag": "celebrities", "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4850359/jack-antonoff-lena-dunham-dog-lamby-animal-shelter-dispute/", "description": "Lena Dunham's boyfriend weighs in on the ongoing dispute between her and a Brooklyn animal shelter over their decision to rehome their dog", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-566051067.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4850359/jack-antonoff-lena-dunham-dog-lamby-animal-shelter-dispute/", "title": "Jack Antonoff Defends Lena Dunham Amid Dispute With Animal Shelter", "description": "\"Nobody on earth cares for or loved Lamby more than Lena\"", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-566051067.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 991230477954201, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499525379.0, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
