The formerly blind singer, 17, made Simon Cowell\u2019s jaw drop just seconds into his take on The Jackson 5\u2019s \u201cWho\u2019s Lovin\u2019 You.\u201d After receiving a standing ovation from the judges and audience, Howie Mandel slammed the coveted button.\n\n\u201cI wanted to cry,\u201d Guardino tells EW, reliving the unexpected moment of glory. \u201cI was really nervous before I got on stage. I was just thinking, I can\u2019t mess up. I can\u2019t mess up. I can\u2019t mess up. But when I saw everything that was going on with the judges, all my nerves turned into strong energy and excitement. I started going off on the song and getting comfortable.\u201d\n\nMaking Guardino\u2019s AGT experience even more special: He was able to watch all the action go down. \u201cI would have never been able to see it before,\u201d says Guardino, who was totally blind before a revolutionary treatment helped him regain most of his sight when he was 12.\n\nStruggling with his vision impairment as a child, Guardino turned to melody. \u201cMusic was always my escape,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was dealing with my condition, it was a way to forget everything that was happening.\u201d\n\nHis disability would end up amplifying his musical talent, too. \u201cMy hearing was strengthened because of my eyesight,\u201d he says. \u201cI hear music in a strong way. It\u2019s always been there for me.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: Here\u2019s How To Save on Concert Tickets So You Still Have Money For Merch\n\nHaving grown up in a musical family, Guardino already has an impressive musical background: In middle school, he performed in a circuit of talent shows on Long Island and sang multiple times at the Apollo Theater. He also performed a duet with Jordin Sparks in November at an event for Michelle Obama\u2019s Partnership for a Healthy America in Washington D.C.\n\nNow he wants to take on songwriting, looking to his idol Stevie Wonder for inspiration. \u201cI feel like I relate to him and what he goes through being blind and struggling with his sight,\u201d he says. \u201cI love his voice. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nHe also looks up to Cowell. While Mandel was the judge to press the golden buzzer for Guardino, immediately securing him a spot in the quarterfinals, Guardino says it was Cowell he was trying to impress. \u201cI know Simon\u2019s so honest and he\u2019s going to tell me how it was, and if I wasn\u2019t good he would tell me,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut I\u2019m really glad he liked me!\u201d\n\nCowell\u2019s October announcement that he would return to the show motivated Guardino to audition. \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of America\u2019s Got Talent and ever since Simon came on it was like, No way. It felt like I had to do this,\u201d remembers Guardino, who went to the pre-round auditions after learning they were being held in New York City\u2019s Queens borough in January. \u201cIt\u2019s been my dream to go in front of him.\u201d\n\nAfter his successful Los Angeles audition, Guardino spotted Cowell outside the theater and walked up to him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be really good friends,\u201d Guardino recalls hearing from Cowell, who hugged him and praised his vocal performance.\n\nThe compliments have poured in, with host Tyra Banks tweeting, \u201cYou just BLEW ME AWAY!\u201d on Tuesday, and Howie Mandel singing his praises in a YouTube video. As Mandel pointed out, the last person to receive a Golden Buzzer from him was last year\u2019s pre-teen contestant Grace VanderWaal, whom Guardino says he\u2019d like to ask for performance tips as he preps for his next appearance on the show in early August. Right now, though, he\u2019s not looking at it as a competition \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll get way too nervous if I think of it that way,\u201d he says \u2014 but rather just another great opportunity to perform.", "images": ["https://ew.com/thmb/7F9NveAi7n-4z69w4LpFSAeAvHw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nup_172848_36471-f3f830a1c7294d568f39858faed23da4.jpg",
