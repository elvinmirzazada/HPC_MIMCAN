Domino's love of cheese runs deep \u2013 it takes thousands of cows and dairy farmers to offer the variety of cheeses that Domino's does. And now, Domino's is celebrating its appreciation of cows and all things dairy by offering customers 50 percent off menu-priced pizzas when ordered online, beginning today and running through Sunday, July 16.\n\n\"At Domino's, we're big fans of cows and dairy farmers,\" said Jenny Fouracre, Domino's spokesperson. \"Without them, we wouldn't be able to offer all of the cheeses \u2013 from mozzarella to Parmesan, feta to provolone, American to Asiago \u2013 that we lovingly put on our pizzas day-in and day-out. It just seems right to celebrate our appreciation of all things dairy by giving customers half off pizza when they use Domino's digital ordering channels.\"\n\nThe 50 percent off deal is only available on menu-priced pizzas ordered through Domino's digital ordering channels, which include Domino's website (www.dominos.com), as well as the iPad\u00ae, iPhone\u00ae, Android\u2122, Windows Phone 8 and Kindle Fire\u00ae apps.\n\nAbout Domino's Pizza\u00ae\n\nFounded in 1960, Domino's Pizza is the recognized world leader in pizza delivery, with a significant business in carryout pizza.
