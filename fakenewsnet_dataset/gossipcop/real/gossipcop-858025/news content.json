It's almost too much for \"Felicity\" fans to hope for, but it happened!\n\nOn Tuesday, Scott Speedman (Ben) joined Keri Russell (Felicity) at her Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony and then, just hours later, the former co-stars appeared side-by-side again on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\"\n\nRobyn Beck / AFP/Getty Images Actors Scott Speedman and Keri Russell attend the star unveiling ceremony for Russell on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, May 30, 2017.\n\nBut before fans of the show get excited about the possibility of another reunion \u2014 as in a series revival \u2014 they should be warned: That really is too much to hope for.\n\nWhen Kimmel asked the pair if a \"'Gilmore Girls-y' kind of thing\" might happen, Speedman said, \"I really don't think so.\"\n\nHowever, he added, \"I would do it.\" The problem is simply that \u201csome people are on some high-class shows.\"\n\nNo doubt he means that with Russell busy on \"The Americans\" and Scott Foley (Noel) working on \"Scandal,\" neither would be eager to return to their WB-drama roots 19 years after it all began.\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection The cast of Felicity back in the day: Scott Speedman, Keri Russell, and Scott Foley.\n\nBut Speedman? \"I'll be on Lifetime in no time,\" he joked.\n\nThe duo might not be headed back to the small screen together, but Russell and Speedman shared some memories from the old days during their chat \u2014 including that unforgettable haircut of hers that left fans reeling in the show's second season.\n\nAs it turns out, the extreme makeover left Speedman reeling, too.\n\nRon Galella, Ltd. / WireImage Actress Keri Russell attends the 51st Annual Primetime Emmy Awards on September 12, 1999.\n\n\"We were actually dating at the time, and I'd been such a disaster of a boyfriend up until then, and I knew I had to put on a good show,\" he said of her big reveal. \"I was like, 'C'mon man, you've got to bring it home, you've got to do it.' I got to work and she turned around the corner and my face sort of froze in a half-panic, half-smile. I just did not pull it off.\"\n\nNot to worry \u2014 even Russell now calls it her \"Chia Pet\" 'do.\n\n\"But it grew into something great, and we all recovered from it,\" he assured.\n\nJason LaVeris / FilmMagic Keri Russell is honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on May 30, 2017.\n\nAs for him being a \"disaster of a boyfriend\" back in the day Russell didn't exactly disagree.\n\n\"A young 20s boyfriend is called a disaster of a boyfriend,\" she laughed.\n\n\"Not much has changed,\" the \"Animal Kingdom\" actor added.\n\nClosed Captioning ON OFF apply | reset x Text Display\n\nBackground\n\nEnhancements font\n\nTimes New Roman Arial Comic Sans\n\nT T T T size\n\n\n\ncolor share link Reunited 'Felicity' stars: The show was 'like college' for us Play Video - 4:42 Reunited 'Felicity' stars: The show was 'like college' for us Play Video - 4:42\n\nRELATED", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170531180340im_/https://nodeassets.today.com/cdnassets/today-images/tdy-header-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170531180340im_/https://c.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170531180340im_/http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2017_22/1218017/keri-russell-today-tease-1-170531_6a50d8ca789825a81156278331b571e7.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170531180340im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_12/1020791/keri-russel-1999-2-today-160321_e9e63a84e27a000b127d10b239472f0c.today-inline-large.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170531180340im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_22/1218017/keri-russell-today-tease-1-170531_6a50d8ca789825a81156278331b571e7.today-inline-large.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170531180340im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_06/404971/1b7003373-ree2_a3caebe53e10e2220a2f4591b1722a23.today-byline.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170531180340im_/http://c.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170531180340im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/151008/tdy_hill_felicity_151008.today-inline-vid-featured-desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170531180340im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_22/1218016/keri-russell-today-inline-2-170531_6a50d8ca789825a81156278331b571e7.today-inline-large.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170531180340im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_41/809006/felicity-today-151007-tease_a46314ed38c11b912b1a092a0957843e.today-inline-large.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170531180340im_/http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2017_22/1218017/keri-russell-today-tease-1-170531_6a50d8ca789825a81156278331b571e7.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ree Hines"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170531180340/http://www.today.com/popculture/felicity-s-keri-russell-scott-speedman-reunite-talk-romance-reboot-t112148", "title": "'Felicity's' Keri Russell and Scott Speedman reunite to talk romance, reboot, and that haircut", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width initial-scale=1 maximum-scale=1 user-scalable=no", "msvalidate.01": "43434ADDF3F60D7897F819F388E2FADF", "author": "Ree Hines", "og": {"description": "Be still our hearts!
