What are they asking for? Trouble,\u201d Karan said at the Cin\u00e9Fashion Film Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday.\n\nLate Monday, the designer said in a statement to PEOPLE that her comments had been taken out of context and she was \u201ctruly sorry to anyone\u201d she offended.\n\nInitially during the red carpet interview with the Daily Mail, the designer talked about injustice women faced around the world before defending her movie mogul friend.\n\nMatt Baron/REX/Shutterstock; Venturelli/WireImage\n\n\u201cI think we have to look at ourselves. Obviously, the treatment of women all over the world is something that has always had to be identified,\u201d she told the reporter. \u201cCertainly in the country of Haiti where I work, in Africa, in the developing world, it\u2019s been a hard time for women.\n\n\u201cTo see it here in our own country is very difficult, but I also think how do we display ourselves? How do we present ourselves as women? What are we asking? Are we asking for it by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality?\n\n\u201cAnd what are we throwing out to our children today about how to dance and how to perform and what to wear? How much should they show?\u201d\n\nRELATED GALLERY: The Harvey Weinstein Scandal: All of the Hollywood Figures Who Have Spoken Out Against Movie Mogul\n\nKaran, who is friends with Weinstein\u2019s wife and Marchesa co-founder Georgina Chapman, also said, \u201cHarvey has done some amazing things,\u201d adding Weinstein and Chapman are \u201cwonderful people.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if Weinstein was \u201cbusted\u201d following The New York Time expos\u00e9, Karan responded in the video, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s only Harvey Weinstein.\u201d\n\nWith her comments sparking outrage on Monday night, the DKNY later spoke out saying she did not mean to offend.\n\n\u201cLast night, I was honored at the Cinemoi Fashion Film Awards in Hollywood and while answering a question on the red carpet I made a statement that unfortunately is not representative of how I feel or what I believe,\u2019 she said in a statement. \u201cI have spent my life championing women. My life has been dedicated to dressing and addressing the needs of women, empowering them and promoting equal rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy statements were taken out of context and do not represent how I feel about the current situation concerning Harvey Weinstein. I believe that sexual harassment is NOT acceptable and this is an issue that MUST be addressed once and for all regardless of the individual.\n\n\u201cI am truly sorry to anyone that I offended and everyone that has ever been a victim.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Harvey Weinstein Says Wife Georgina Chapman Is \u2018Standing By\u2019 Him as He Claims He \u2018Never Laid a Glove\u2019 on Ashley Judd\n\nOne of those who was offended by her comments was Rose McGowan, who reportedly reached a settlement with Weinstein after an alleged inappropriate incident.\n\nMcGowan \u2014 who previously branded Weinstein a \u201cmonster\u201d \u2013 was shocked at Karan\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cDonna Karan you are a DEPLORABLE Aiding and abetting is a moral crime. You are scum in a fancy dress,\u201d McGowan tweeted.\n\nWhile celebrity chef and CNN star Anthony Bourdain also came out against Karan\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cTo @dkny How many seventeen year olds have you dressed like they are, in your words, \u2018asking for it\u2019?\u201d Bourdain also shared, along with a DKNY ad.\n\nThe Weinstein scandal comes after the NYT reported Thursday that eight women, including actress Ashley Judd, came forward to accuse the film mogul of sexual misconduct. Following the allegations, the Oscar-winning film producer was removed from his powerhouse film studio The Weinstein Company.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the way I\u2019ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I\u2019m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go,\u201d Weinstein said, adding that he was working with therapists and planned to take time off to \u201cdeal with this issue head-on.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NYT, Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, including McGowan.
