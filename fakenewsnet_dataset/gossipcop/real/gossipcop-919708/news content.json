He will also remain as host and executive producer of his syndicated radio program \"On Air With Ryan Seacrest\" from Los Angeles.\n\n\"It's genuinely hard to put into words what 'American Idol' means to me,\" Seacrest, 42, said in a statement. \"I'm so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it's allowed me to experience.\"\n\nThe show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007.\n\nThe glitzy talent show that launched the careers of Kelly Clarkson, Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson and others - spiced with celebrity judges who alternately feuded and fawned - eventually fell victim to declining ratings.\n\nWithin the United States, the \"American Idol\" phenomenon spawned a host of competing shows such as NBC's \"The Voice,\" CBS's \"Rock Star\", and Fox's \"The X Factor.\"\n\nPop star Katy Perry, who is set to judge the next generation of artists on the show, took to Twitter to express her excitement about the news and sing the praises of Seacrest.\n\n\"I'm spicy, @RyanSeacrest is seasoned!\" wrote Perry. \"All the right ingredients are coming together on @AmericanIdol.\"\n\nReporting by Melissa Fares in New York;
