The tension was R.E.A.L. \u2014 and fans definitely noticed.\n\nDespite differing opinions here and there, the judging panel \u2014 Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel, and Mel B \u2013 seemed to generally agree with one another. But things got a bit personal between the music executive and former Spice Girl a few times during the first round of live shows.\n\nThe feud began when Amanda Mena, a 15-year-old singer and Mel B's golden buzzer pick, took the stage to perform. Before Amanda began her Spanish and English rendition of Pink's \"What About Us,\" Mel B told host Tyra Banks that the young performer reminded her of herself. Simon then mumbled back \"Yeah, but she can sing.\"\n\nUm, okay, Simon.\n\nGiphy\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first, the English singer appeared to ignore Simon's snarky response (that, or she didn't hear him) and went on to clarify what she meant.\n\n\"Nobody accepted her [Amanda], and she fought, and she proceeded,\" Mel said. Simon then interjected again:\"'Cause she has a good voice.\" Mel B then yelled \"Simon, stop it!\" before shooting him a look.\n\nBut that wasn't the end of it. When Amanda's performance concluded, the two butted heads again after Simon told her he believes Amanda should be \"in a group going forward.\"\n\n\n\n\"Stop! Stop you right there. She's a solo artist and she will always be one,\" Mel B shot back, to which Simon just shrugged his shoulders. Tyra, seemingly defending Simon, kindly suggested to Mel B that she didn't think it was meant to be taken as a diss.\n\nBut despite Tyra trying to calm everyone down, Twitter was fired up about the exchanges.\n\nLongtime fans of the show know that the two have had their fair share of on-air heated arguments before. When dancing cop Deuntay Diggs performed in season 12, Simon took a dig at Mel B. \"You were successful without being able to dance,\" Simon alleged.\n\nBut perhaps their worst exchange happened last August. Simon, once again, went after Mel B while giving feedback to a magician.\n\n\u201cI kind of imagine this would be like Mel B\u2019s wedding night,\u201d Simon began. \u201cA lot of anticipation, not much promise or delivery.\u201d Mel B responded by throwing a cup of water on him and walked off. At the time, she was undergoing divorce proceedings with her estranged husband.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe should know if you say something inappropriate he\u2019s gonna, like, get stuff thrown at him. In a friendly way. I made sure there was no ice in it this time,\u201d Mel B explained to Variety at the time. \u201cI told him he was an a--hole and that was it, and he goes, \u2018Oh, whatever.'\u201d\n\nYikes! Here's hoping the two get along in real life, and that the on-camera feuding stays, well, on camera.\n\nWatch America's Got Talent live shows Tuesdays and the result episodes Wednesdays on NBC at 8
