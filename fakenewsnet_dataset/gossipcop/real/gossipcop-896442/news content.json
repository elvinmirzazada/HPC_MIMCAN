He is completely besotted and nothing would make him happier if they were starting a family,\" the source says.\n\nIn a March interview with ET, royal expert Katie Nicholl said, \"My sources are saying that Prince Harry, particularly, is very keen to start a family, pretty soon after the royal wedding. He's made no secret about wanting children.\"\n\n\"Meghan is very doting with children,\" Nicholl continued. \"She is very maternal and she was thrilled to meet George and Charlotte. I think one of the lovely things, anecdotes that I discovered [while writing my book] was, it was actually a moment involving children when Meghan really fell for Prince Harry.\"\n\nThe couple also opened up about starting a family during their first joint interview together after their engagement last year. \"I think eventually, one step at a time, and we\u2019ll start a family in the near future,\" they said.\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-09%2F1280_prince_harry.jpg%3Fh%3Dc303a744&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/gettyimages-1026730856.jpg?h=1a8590bc", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2020-03/meghanharry.jpg?h=827f73f4&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-08%2F1280_harry_markle.jpg%3Fh%3D70da6ea5&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-09%2Fgettyimages-1027834978.jpg%3Fh%3D409c34f8&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/gettyimages-1026730856.jpg?h=1a8590bc", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-are-eager-to-start-a-family-source-says-109237", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Are 'Eager to Start a Family,' Source Says", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/gettyimages-1026730856.jpg?h=1a8590bc", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "ET's source says that while the couple is focused on their charitable interests right now, they can't wait to have kids.", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 'Eager to Start a Family,' Source Says", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-are-eager-to-start-a-family-source-says-109237", "type": "Article"}, "description": "ET's source says that while the couple is focused on their charitable interests right now, they can't wait to have kids.", "twitter": {"description": "ET's source says that while the couple is focused on their charitable interests right now, they can't wait to have kids.", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 'Eager to Start a Family,' Source Says", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-are-eager-to-start-a-family-source-says-109237", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/gettyimages-1026730856.jpg?h=1a8590bc", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Are 'Eager to Start a Family,' Source Says  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Babies & Kids", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
