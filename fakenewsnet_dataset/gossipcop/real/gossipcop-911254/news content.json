I've never met any member of the family -- actually, I've met Kendall just in passing at a fashion event -- but I honestly don't know them,\" Minogue says. \"It's awkward, because fans get so loyal and vocal, and we love that! But it was nothing personal at all, I'm at pains to say.\"\n\n\"Trademark is long, it's boring, it's expensive, and it's really important. I've been doing that for years and years. It was just causing confusion with customers. As long as it's clear, then we can all win,\" she continued.\n\nMinogue appeared to majorly shade Jenner in her letter to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office last year, which described her as \"a secondary reality television personality\" -- while she called herself an \"internationally-renowned performing artist, humanitarian and breast cancer activist known worldwide simply as \u2018Kylie.\u2019\"\n\n\"What was upsetting to me was that there was -- they attributed a quote to me... Can you imagine me saying that?!\" Minogue adds. \"That was just unfortunate that that is how those lawyers speak. So I genuinely hope that it's understood: That certainly did not come from me.\"\n\n\"Good news is, that's all wrapped up, we didn't have to go to court. That's all done. And I'm sure I'll meet them one day,\" she shares. \"The weird thing is, in America, when I am there, they would never introduce me just as 'Kylie'; it's still 'Kylie Minogue.' It took so long for people to get my name in the first place. 'Kyle?' 'No, Kyle-E!'\"\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-03%2Fkylie_kylie_vidpic_1280Copy2.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-02%2Fet_KylievsKylie_020617_1280.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2F1280_kylie_minogue_kylie_jenner_split.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2Fchrissy_teigen_wwhl_youtube.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/1280_kylie_minogue_kylie_jenner_split.jpg?h=c673cd1c"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/1280_kylie_minogue_kylie_jenner_split.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kylie-minogue-says-trademark-battle-with-kylie-jenner-wasnt-personal-95673", "title": "Kylie Minogue Says Trademark Battle With Kylie Jenner Wasn't Personal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/1280_kylie_minogue_kylie_jenner_split.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 49-year-old singer rehashed the 'awkward' battle of the Kylies.", "title": "Kylie Minogue Says Trademark Battle With Kylie Jenner Wasn't Personal", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kylie-minogue-says-trademark-battle-with-kylie-jenner-wasnt-personal-95673", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 49-year-old singer rehashed the 'awkward' battle of the Kylies.", "twitter": {"description": "The 49-year-old singer rehashed the 'awkward' battle of the Kylies.", "title": "Kylie Minogue Says Trademark Battle With Kylie Jenner Wasn't Personal", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kylie-minogue-says-trademark-battle-with-kylie-jenner-wasnt-personal-95673", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/1280_kylie_minogue_kylie_jenner_split.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Kylie Minogue Says Trademark Battle With Kylie Jenner Wasn't Personal | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Kylie Minogue, Kylie Jenner", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
