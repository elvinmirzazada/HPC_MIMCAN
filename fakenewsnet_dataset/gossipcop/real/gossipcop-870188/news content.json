{"url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/justin-bieber-purpose-tour-merch-cancel-tour", "text": "It\u2019s been about a week since Justin Bieber abruptly canceled his Purpose Tour, citing a need to relax. On top of understandable disappointment, most fans offered support and well wishes to their favorite singer, hoping that he gets the rest that he needs. But this week, when Justin was seen out in Los Angeles wearing the very Purpose Tour merch that fans were hoping to get at his upcoming shows, they didn't respond kindly. One fan account put it bluntly, \u201cstop wearing purpose tour merch. it's kind of a huge slap on our faces.\u201d\n\nNow, it\u2019s likely that Justin has plenty of Purpose Tour merch tees (it was his tour after all) and maybe he just needed a clean tee to step outside in. One person said it perfectly when they wrote, \u201csomeone has to wear the remaining shirts.\u201d\n\nLast week, Justin told his fans that he\u2019s been on tour for the last two years and it was time for him to stop and regroup. He seemed genuinely apologetic \u2014 but firm about prioritizing his mental health \u2014 and it seems highly unlikely that he would follow that statement by taunting fans with a Purpose Tour outfit. Justin has yet to make any follow-up statements about a future tour or concert series. In the meantime, we hope he\u2019s doing well and getting the rest he needs.", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59775f200133426203853927/1:1/pass/justin-tout.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6565f8459ffee5d104c24ca8/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5981d588a604cc440dae9bec/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/spl1547149_013.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5981d5aca604cc440dae9bee/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-689120270.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/64f7236bf2228e27c97f1c74/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6547a797e2c655d22665c0ff/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/598088014077d013e0136269/1:1/pass/tout.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5971f5c81484385ce0316955/1:1/pass/GettyImages-681949920.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/65568ecdff1de3cb5a62dfaa/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/654d226748d5b8e1df8fa204/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5981d6912200ef0be49bebae/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jb%20Cropped.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5981d6912200ef0be49bebae/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jb%20Cropped.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Alyssa Hardy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/justin-bieber-purpose-tour-merch-cancel-tour", "title": "Justin Bieber Wears Purpose Tour Merch After Cancelling Tour", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Justin Bieber was seen out wearing Purpose Tour merchandise just a few days after he canceled his tour \u2014 and fans are not happy about it.", "id": "5981c562e04ba21beb2a504d", "keywords": "justin bieber,purpose tour,purpose tour merch", "news_keywords": "justin bieber,purpose tour,purpose tour merch", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5981c562e04ba21beb2a504d", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Justin Bieber was seen out wearing Purpose Tour merchandise just a few days after he canceled his tour \u2014 and fans are not happy about it.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5981d5a89062cb124d6023e3/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-689120270.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5981d5a89062cb124d6023e3/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-689120270.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\"It's a slap in the face.\"", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5981d6912200ef0be49bebae/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jb%20Cropped.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Justin Bieber Fans Are Pissed He Wore Purpose Merch After Cancelling His Tour", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/justin-bieber-purpose-tour-merch-cancel-tour"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-08-02T13:42:56.349Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-02T13:42:56.349Z", "author": "Alyssa Hardy"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "\"It's a slap in the face.\"", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5981d6912200ef0be49bebae/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jb%20Cropped.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Justin Bieber Fans Are Pissed He Wore Purpose Merch After Cancelling His Tour"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5981d6912200ef0be49bebae/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/jb%20Cropped.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501681376.349, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
