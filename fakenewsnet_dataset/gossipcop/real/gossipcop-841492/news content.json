Benett/Getty Just one month before the 10-year anniversary of their mother's death (and on what would have her 46th birthday) Prince William and Prince Harry hosted a concert at London's Wembley Stadium in Princess Diana's honor. The Concert for Diana featured performances from Elton John and Kanye West and others along with speeches from big names like Bill Clinton, Nelson Mandela and David Beckham. The event was \u2013 and still is \u2013 the largest public memorial event for Diana since her funeral.\n\n02 of 13 KATE'S RING Samir Hussein/Getty When Prince William and the then-Kate Middleton revealed their engagement in 2010, all eyes were on the familiar rock on Kate's left ring finger. The 12-carat oval sapphire encircled with 14 solitaire diamonds is the same one Prince Charles gave to Diana in 1981. During the couple's official engagement interview, William said that he chose the ring to keep Diana a part of the experience. \"Obviously she's not going to be around to share any of the fun and excitement of it all \u2013 this was my way of keeping her close to it all.\"\n\n03 of 13 WILL AND KATE'S WEDDING Suzanne Plunkett/WPA Pool/Getty From the flowers to the venue, William and Kate's 2011 wedding was literally brimming with reminders of Diana. Westminster Abbey is where Diana's funeral was held in 1997; Kate included Lily of the Valley in her bouquet, just like Diana did; Bishop of London Richard Chartres, who spoke at Diana's memorial service, gave the sermon; and the first hymn, \"Guide Me Thou, O Great Redeemer,\" is the same one that concluded Diana's funeral. Even Carole Middleton paid homage to the late royal by wearing Catherine Walker, Diana's favorite designer, on the day.\n\n04 of 13 HARRY'S TRIP TO BRAZIL Chris Jackson/Getty Years may have passed, but the princes clearly still feel their mother's loss intensely. Last year, on a trip to Brazil, Prince Harry was nearly brought to tears while speaking with two young orphans who had also lost their mother.\n\n05 of 13 GEORGE'S GODPARENTS John Stillwell/WPA Pool/Getty Even with six or more slots to fill, there's still stiff competition when it comes to selecting royal godparents. Seven godparents were named for Prince George back in 2013, ranging from cousins to close friends of his parents. But despite the many options, William and Kate made a clear effort to choose someone dear to Diana's heart \u2013 Julia Samuel, a close friend of the Princess of Wales from 1987 until her death.\n\n06 of 13 WILLIAM'S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE ROYAL MARSDEN Lefteris Pitarakis/WPA Pool/Getty Both William and Harry are involved with many philanthropic organizations, and in many cases, have worked with causes Diana championed. Since 2007, Prince William has served as president of the Royal Marsden Hospital Trust, a position his mother held from 1989 until her death. Just as she did in 1996, William observed a procedure during a November 2013 visit.\n\n07 of 13 HARRY'S WORK IN ANGOLA Anwar Hussein/Wireimage In 2013, Harry followed in his mother's footsteps when he visited Angola, where his mom famously crusaded against the use of land mines, with the same charitable organization she did back in 1997. Here, he shakes the hand of Eufrafina, a 3-year-old girl whose mother met Diana 16 years prior.\n\n08 of 13 GEORGE'S TRIP DOWN UNDER Chris Jackson/Getty Like Diana, William and Kate have already proven themselves to be modern-minded when it comes to raising their two children. So it's only fitting that, just as Diana and Charles did with William nine months after his birth, William and Kate brought Prince George on their own tour to New Zealand and Australia. In royal generations past, parents would leave their young children at home in the care of nannies instead.\n\n09 of 13 CHARLOTTE'S NAME David Sims/WENN Defying those who said that his mother's name wouldn't make an appearance in his daughter's many monikers, William gave Princess Charlotte Diana as her second middle name, a sweet and sentimental way of showing just how much the memory of his mother still means to him.\n\n10 of 13 CHARLOTTE'S CHRISTENING Mary Turner - WPA Pool/Getty Another way the couple paid homage to William's late mother was when they christened their daughter at St. Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham, the same location where Diana was christened in 1961. Will and Kate also selected one of Diana's favorite photographers, Mario Testino, to take Charlotte's christening portraits. As Diana's ex-bodyguard Ken Wharfe told PEOPLE, \"William is keen to subtly keep [Diana's] legend alive.\" \"There are more references being made to Diana than there ever have been. This is a silent reference, if you like,\" he said of the christening location.\n\n11 of 13 THE HALO TRUST The HALO Trust/Getty;Tim Graham/Getty Both William and Harry have honored their late mother's memory by taking up the charities and causes that she championed. In 2013, Harry became a patron of the HALO Trust, an organization that clears landmines and the same organization that Diana famously partnered with in 1997. That year, Di's walk through a partially cleared landmine field in Angola made headlines around the world. Harry also took a landmine walk in Mozambique in 2010. Di's youngest son also met with Sen. John McCain to tour a Hale exhibit in Washington D.C. in 2013.\n\n12 of 13 Chris Jackson/Getty Harry chose to honor his mother by including two diamond\u2019s from Diana\u2019s personal collection in Meghan\u2019s stunning engagement ring. \u201cI think everything about Harry\u2019s thoughtfulness is \u2013 and the inclusion of that and obviously not being able to meet his mom it\u2019s so important to me to know that she\u2019s a part of this with us,\u201d Meghan said about the ring during the couple\u2019s engagement interview in November.", "images":
