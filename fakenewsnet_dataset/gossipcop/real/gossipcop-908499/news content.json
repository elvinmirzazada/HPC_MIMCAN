They were joined by Kate and Prince William's three children for the first time.\n\nKate opted for a white blazer-style dress with sharp lapels and a flared skirt by Alexander McQueen, her wedding dress designer, with a white-and-blue Philip Treacy hat, coordinating with her kids. The Duchess of Cambridge, 40, previously sported the ensemble at the G7 Leaders' reception in June 2021. The same day, Kate joined Camilla and Queen Elizabeth at a reception with volunteers who are taking part in the Big Jubilee Lunch that will be a centerpiece of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations on Sunday.\n\nCamilla, Duchess of Cornwall and Kate Middleton.

The wife of Prince Charles wore the same coat dress in June 2021 to attend a horse racing day at Royal Ascot.\n\nPrince George, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and Kate Middleton. Tim Rooke/Shutterstock\n\nPrince Louis also sported a royal rewear \u2014 decades in the making!\n\nMaking his Trooping the Colour carriage debut, the 4-year-old prince wore the same mini sailor suit that his father, Prince William, wore to Trooping at age 2 in 1985. (That's the same year Louis' uncle, Prince Harry, made his own Trooping the Colour debut.)\n\nFor more on the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.\n\nThe blue-and-white theme continued with George in a navy blue suit and Charlotte in a royal blue short-sleeved dress with matching ribbons in her hair.\n\nPrince William (left) in 1985 and Prince Louis in the same outfit on June 2. Anwar Hussein/WireImage, Ian Vogler - WPA Pool/Getty\n\nAlthough the Queen's 96th birthday was on April 21, Trooping the Colour always takes place in the early summer of the second weekend in June. The reason is a practical matter more than anything: the weather is nicer. The tradition is believed to have started during the reign of King George II in 1748. George II was born in October, but the annual Trooping of the Colour became a celebration of the monarch as well as the armed forces.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

70-year reign.\n\nThe planned events include the lighting of Platinum Jubilee beacons, a service of Thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral, the Derby at Epsom Downs, a live concert called \"Platinum Party at the Palace,\" the Big Jubilee Lunch and the Platinum Jubilee Pageant.", "images":
