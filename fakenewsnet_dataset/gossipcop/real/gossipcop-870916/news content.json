Though excess weight and a lack of exercise can contribute to the problem, even thin women grapple with it.\n\nAccording to a study by Neutrogena, 70 percent of women have cellulite. More women have it than men, because women have thinner skin, so it shows more clearly.\n\nWrestling With Cellulite\n\nOver the years, Vivian Carlson has done everything to stay in shape: she runs, goes to the gym and eats healthily, but has had no luck in getting rid of her cellulite. At one point, she even took a dust buster to her inner thigh, hoping to suck the dimply skin away.\n\n\"I heard about the treatments they give at the spas \u2014 this wasn't so different,\" Carlson said. \"It's all suction and massage. Why spend the money on the spa treatments? I thought I was on to something.\"\n\nBut all she got for her efforts was some red skin. So Carlson avoids wearing dresses or skirts and wears a skirted bathing suit to the beach.\n\nShe's not alone, and that is why the interest in anti-cellulite creams is so strong.\n\nLinda Wells, editor-in-chief of Allure magazine, says the new products claim to help with the appearance of cellulite, and do not say that they can banish it completely\n\n\"No cream will get rid of cellulite,\" Wells said. \"And they don't really say that they do. What they say is 'help the appearance of cellulite.'\"\n\nCaffeine is in almost every cellulite-reducing product that shows any benefit, because it helps blood flow to the skin and works like a diuretic, Wells said, adding that it flushes you out.\n\n\"In removing moisture from the skin, it firms it, albeit temporarily,\" Wells said.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/random/svg/gma_logo.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/trunk-ht-ml-231129_1701265298043_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/wirestory_278e6651e99593b17a00bc71c37bfc85_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/pence-trump3-file-gty-ml-231127_1701110318739_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/deutsche-bank-logo-gty-ps-231012_1697114884556_hpMain_3_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/images/hulu.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/rockefeller-tree-ap-jef-231128_1701183464711_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=125038&page=1", "title": "Do Anti-Cellulite Creams Really Work?", "meta_data": {"keywords": "cellulite creams, healthy woman, fat, Article, 125038", "copyright": "2023 ABC News", "author": "ABC News", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Do Anti-Cellulite Creams Really Work?", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=125038&page=1", "title": "Do Anti-Cellulite Creams Really Work?", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2006-01-06T12:05:38Z", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,125038", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,125038", "googleplay": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=125038&page=1"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "ABC News", "title": "Do Anti-Cellulite Creams Really Work?", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=125038&page=1", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,125038", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,125038", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for ipad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=125038&page=1", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=125038&page=1"}}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
