I did. So CPS were like \u2014 I was in the hospital \u2014 they said, \u2018Did you smoke when you were pregnant?\u2019 I said, \u2018I did within the past 30 days. I said I have really bad esophageal spasms and I throw up every 5 minutes, I can\u2019t even eat.\u2019 And they said, \u2018Okay, some moms do that. We are not here to judge, we are writing down your information.'\u201d\n\nA rep for Evans did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nJenelle Evans Instagram\n\n\u201cAnd after I had Ensley they said CPS will just come by to do a [wellness] check since you tested positive,\u201d Evans continued. \u201cThey came and did a [wellness] checkup and everything is fine. They closed the case.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Teen Mom 2\u2019s Jenelle Evans Reveals Past Heroin Addiction: \u2018I Was Shooting Up Four or Five Times a Day\u2019\n\nEvans said this was not the first time CPS had checked her home, saying, \u201cCPS has been here like 30 times, not just for that, but for haters online saying that I abuse my kids. So they came and checked up on that.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cFirst of all if I were on drugs I wouldn\u2019t be able to sit here in the morning and get the kids ready and eat healthily. Or I\u2019d be losing a lot of weight.\u201d\n\nThe mother of three has been open in the past about her previous drug addiction, writing in her book, Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom, that she once used heroin four or five times a day during the peak of her addiction.\n\nEvans wrote in an excerpt obtained by E! News that she wouldn\u2019t \u201cglamorize the drug by going into the long details of why people love it so damned much,\u201d but admitted her \u201cfirst trip was amazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore I knew it, I was shooting up four or five times a day. I was hooked,\u201d she wrote.", "images":
