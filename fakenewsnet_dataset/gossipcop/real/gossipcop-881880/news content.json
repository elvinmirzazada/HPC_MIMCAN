I'm sorry for any inconvenience this causes, but hope everyone who sees the show will agree it was worth the wait.\"\n\nSee more in the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/KATY.jpg?h=6b30954e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2Fkaty_perry_orlando_bloom.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/KATY.jpg?h=6b30954e", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/katy-perry-opens-witness-tour-cover-janet-jackson-hit-watch-87746", "title": "Katy Perry Opens 'Witness' Tour With Cover of Janet Jackson Hit -- Watch!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/KATY.jpg?h=6b30954e", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 32-year-old singer also put her best spin on Jackson's choreography.", "title": "Katy Perry Opens 'Witness' Tour With Cover of Janet Jackson Hit -- Watch!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/katy-perry-opens-witness-tour-cover-janet-jackson-hit-watch-87746", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 32-year-old singer also put her best spin on Jackson's choreography.", "twitter": {"description": "The 32-year-old singer also put her best spin on Jackson's choreography.", "title": "Katy Perry Opens 'Witness' Tour With Cover of Janet Jackson Hit -- Watch!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/katy-perry-opens-witness-tour-cover-janet-jackson-hit-watch-87746", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/KATY.jpg?h=6b30954e", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Katy Perry Opens 'Witness' Tour With Cover of Janet Jackson Hit -- Watch! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Music, News, Katy Perry, Janet Jackson", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 41, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
