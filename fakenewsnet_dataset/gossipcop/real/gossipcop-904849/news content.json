Not only were people shocked and appalled by the image, but many also called for a boycott.\n\nWhose idea was it at @hm to have this little sweet black boy wear a jumper that says 'coolest monkey in the jungle'?\n\n\n\nI mean. What. pic.twitter.com/6AJfMdQS4L \u2014 Stephanie Yeboah (@NerdAboutTown) January 7, 2018\n\nThey had the option of two other hoodies in that collection but they decided to go with one that labelling a black child as 'the coolest monkey in the jungle'. Comparing black people with monkeys has a long, dark history. H&M had a whole team who reviewed and proceeded with it. \u2014 Sara (@sara28aa_) January 8, 2018\n\nCan't be more confused and disgusted. H&M decided to put the black boy in a \"Coolest Monkey in the Jungle\" hoody and the white boy in a \"Survival Expert\" hoody. Can't believe it's 2018 and this offensive sickening racism still exists. We all must boycott H&M till they apologize. pic.twitter.com/OdynDKupjS \u2014 BASH (@XIBash) January 8, 2018\n\nIn a statement to HuffPost Canada, a spokesperson for H&M Canada said, \"We completely understand and agree with [The Weeknd's] reaction to the image. We are deeply sorry that the picture was taken, and we also regret the actual print. We have removed the image from all our channels and the sweater is no longer for sale in our stores. We will also look into our internal routines to avoid such situations in the future.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also added that the company \"will continue the discussion with The Weeknd and his team separately.\"\n\nThe Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, began collaborating with H&M last year and released two successful 2017 collections with the retailer: Spring Icons and The Weeknd Collection.\n\nMany fans praised the singer for taking a stand against the company.\n\nKing of speaking out \u2014 Dari (@tattooedreams) January 8, 2018", "images":
