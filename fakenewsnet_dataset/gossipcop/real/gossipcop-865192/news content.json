However, he clarified with an interview on Today that it\u2019s not the case.\n\n\u201cThey made so much of a big deal out of this,\u201d he explained. \u201cI got asked in an interview if I read negative things and I was like, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t even go on Twitter anymore.\u2019 It\u2019s not like I quit it. I still post on Instagram and post on Twitter.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI\u2019m just not going to wake up and read something and be like, \u2018Well, that\u2019s rude.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to choose to do that anymore, and everyone\u2019s made a huge deal out of it.\u201d\n\nHost Matt Lauer said he likely had plenty of good tweets to read thanks to his fans who were outside ready to watch him perform.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much positivity out there,\u201d Sheeran replied. \u201cI\u2019m just saying as a human being, we always read the one negative one and ignore the others, and I don\u2019t want to do that. It\u2019s just foolish to do when there\u2019s love out there in the world to look at the negative stuff. I\u2019m just choosing not to read it.\u201d\n\nSheeran told The Sun that he still finds that a troll can bring him down.\n\n\u201cOne comment ruins your day,\u201d he shared. \u201cThe head f\u2014 for me has been trying to work out why people dislike me so much.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: If You Had To Google For \u2018Ibiza\u2019 After The Grammys, You\u2019re Not Alone\n\nLady Gaga came out in support of Sheeran after he mentioned that her fans sometimes assumed he was speaking about her during interviews.\n\n\u201cWhat an incredible talented artist I LOVE ED,\u201d she wrote. \u201c@teddysphotos deserves all our love and respect like all humans do. I wish all people on the internet would be positive and loving and a part of creating an online community that is kind and empowering, not hateful and mean. No reason to tear down an artist simply because they are on top. Work harder to be kinder everybody. That should be your first duty to humanity.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Sheeran clarified his remarks on Instagram: \u201c\u2026loads of Hoo-har about me quitting stuff. I haven\u2019t quit anything, I\u2019m just not reading anything, except Harry Potter. Hope everyone had a wonderful July 4th yo.\u201d\n\nFresh from headlining Sunday night at the Glastonbury Festival, Sheeran is back on the road as part of his North American tour to support his latest album, \u00f7.", "images":
