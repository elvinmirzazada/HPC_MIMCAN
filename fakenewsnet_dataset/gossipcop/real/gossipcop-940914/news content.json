Through her marriage to Barron Nicholas Hilton II, she is now a member of the Hilton family.\n\nEarly life and ancestry [ edit ]\n\nCountess Tessa von Walderdorff was born on 20 February 1994 in New York City,[1] as the elder daughter of photographer and artist Count Franz von Walderdorff (b. 1961)[2] and his wife, Anna-Sabrina Br\u00fchwiler (b. 1963), also an artist.[3][4][5] She is of German heritage on her father's side and of German, Swiss, French, and Danish heritage on her mother's side.[6][7] Walderdorff spoke French as her first language, and later became fluent in German and in English.[8]\n\nShe is a member of the German noble Walderdorff family and is a descendant of the German House of L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, thus a morgnatic branch of the House of Wittelsbach, which ruled over the Kingdom of Bavaria. Through her father, Count Franz, Tessa is related to King Charles III and the British royal family, sharing mutual ancestry from Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and his second wife, Countess Augusta Reuss of Ebersdorf.[9] As a child, Walderdorff spent a lot of time at Schloss H\u00f6fling, an 18th century castle near Regensburg, Bavaria on lease to her family by the Princely House of Thurn and Taxis.[8]\n\nWalderdorff's paternal grandfather, Count Hugo von Walderdorff (1929-2008), left Germany during World War II to escape forced recruitment into the Hitler Youth.[10] Her paternal grandmother is Countess Marie Josepha von Ballestrem (b. 1936), daughter of Princess Therese zu L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg (1909-2000) and a granddaughter of Aloysius, Prince of L\u00f6wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg and his wife, Countess Josephine Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1874-1946), who in turn was a great-granddaughter of Princess Sophie of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, aunt of Queen Victoria and her husband, Albert, Prince Consort.
