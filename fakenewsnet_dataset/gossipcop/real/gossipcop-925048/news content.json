Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. and more celebrity couples prove relationships can work in Hollywood.\n\nThe I Know What You Did Last Summer costars, for example, have one of the most solid marriages in the industry. \u201cThere\u2019s no keys. There\u2019s no rules. There\u2019s nothing like that. I don\u2019t believe in false expectations,\u201d Prinze Jr. exclusively told Us Weekly in February 2020. \u201cI just believe in knowing who you are when you start a relationship. And if you don\u2019t, then that relationship probably isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\n\nThe She\u2019s All That star elaborated on his and Gellar\u2019s efforts to define themselves beyond their careers, which led to their thriving romance.\n\n\u201cFor Sarah and I, we\u2019re very private people. We try to make each other laugh, and we both kind of knew who we were,\u201d he noted. \u201cHollywood\u2019s a crazy business \u2018cause there\u2019s very few locals here. \u2026 And we can pick you out of a crowd. It\u2019s like a lion seeing the weak gazelle. So, when you come out here, and you don\u2019t know who you are, this business will define you and it will put its fingerprints all over you. It wants to do that. It needs to do that. And if you do know who you are, then you can kind of control your own destiny much more easily.\u201d\n\nPrinze Jr. added: \u201cThe same rule applies in a relationship. If you don\u2019t know who you are when you get in that relationship, odds are the other person is going to have a big hand in defining what kind of person you\u2019re going to be. Or, and worse, if you pretend to be someone else, that\u2019s a lie you\u2019ve got to live forever if you want that relationship to work out forever. So, knowing yourself is sort of the key to doing it.\u201d\n\nAs for Lively and Reynolds, a source exclusively told Us in December 2020 that they are \u201cmore committed to their marriage\u201d than ever.\n\n\u201cBlake and Ryan are two extremely proud and private people and keeping their relationship low-key and off radar is what\u2019s worked so well for them over the years,\u201d the insider said at the time. \u201cAway from the cameras, people may find it surprising to hear they\u2019re just a regular couple who love to hang out and do the normal things together without making a song and dance about it all.\u201d\n\nIn June 2022, just a few months ahead of their 10th wedding anniversary, another insider exclusively told Us that Lively and Reynolds are \u201ccommitted to each other for life\u201d and maintain not only a strong coparenting dynamic but a romantic relationship.\n\nThank You!

Usually being married for almost 10 years, couples change or grow apart, but not them. They are still head over heels for each other.\u201d\n\nScroll through the gallery below to see some of Hollywood\u2019s hottest celebrity couples who prove that love is not dead!", "images":
