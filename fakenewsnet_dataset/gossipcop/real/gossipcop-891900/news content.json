The security official then asks him \u201cWho are you?\u201d and the ATP No. 1-ranked star replies, simply \u201cRafael Nadal.\u201d\n\n\u201cNadal, OK, thank you,\u201d the guard says as he lets him pass.\n\nNadal seemed to take the guard\u2019s confusion in stride as he gave him a quick pat on the arm before finally gaining admission to the court.\n\nUnfortunately for Nadal, he had to pull out of the tournament on Friday, citing a right knee injury. The knee was taped in his third-round win over Pablo Cuevas but was the apparent reason he chose not to face his next opponent, Serbian qualifier Filip Krajinovic.\n\n\u201cI have to pull out,\u201d Nadal later said to the press. \u201cOf course it\u2019s a very tough decision for me, especially here in Paris, which has been the most important city in my career without a doubt.\u201d\n\nThe Spaniard is a 10-time French Open Champion. His status for the ATP finals is unclear.", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/11/06/62SO23EOE4WYPPYEQKPQLOTLMQ.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/11/06/62SO23EOE4WYPPYEQKPQLOTLMQ.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariel Scotti"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/11/06/rafael-nadal-stopped-by-security-guard-who-didnt-recognize-him-at-paris-masters/", "title": "Rafael Nadal stopped by security guard who didn\u2019t recognize him at Paris Masters", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Rafael Nadal, the top-ranked tennis player in the world, was denied entry onto a court at the tournament by a guard who didn't recognize him", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Rafael Nadal stopped by security guard who didn\u2019t recognize him at Paris Masters", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/11/06/rafael-nadal-stopped-by-security-guard-who-didnt-recognize-him-at-paris-masters/", "description": "Rafael Nadal, the top-ranked tennis player in the world, was denied entry onto a court at the Paris Masters tournament.
