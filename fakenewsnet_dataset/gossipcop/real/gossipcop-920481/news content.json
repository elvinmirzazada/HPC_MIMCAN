She has such an incredible soul,' Zayn shared in a note posted earlier today.\n\n'I'm grateful to all of our fans for respecting this difficult decision and our privacy at this time. We wish this news would have come from us first. We love you all.'\n\nGigi added:\n\n'Breakup statements often seem impersonal because there is really no way to put into words what two people experience together over a few years..not only in a relationship but in life in general. I'm forever grateful for the love, time and life lessons Z and I shared. I want nothing but the best for him and will continue to support him as a friend that I have immense respect and love for. As for the future, whatever's meant to be will always be. x G.'\n\nFollowing a break-up, no one wants to see photos of their ex or family popping up on their Instagram feed, so it's understandable why the 'Pillowtalk' singer would want to remove the chance of that happening all together.\n\nAnd while the split is heartbreaking for both Zayn and Gigi right now, we can imagine it's also hard for Gigi's mother, Yolanda, who has regularly spoken of her love for Malik over the years.\n\nJust last year, the mother-of-three opened up about welcoming the singer into her family.\n\nIn a previous interview the former model said: 'He's a beautiful human being from Bradford, England,' she explained. 'He's from the same background that I'm from, him and I get along great and he's like a son to me. It's all good.\n\n'He has no family here and he's so far away so I understand that life because I lived that life. I think that I'm just a momma to him.'\n\nAll our support goes to Gigi and Zayn during this difficult time.\n\nRelated Story Gigi And Zayn Have Broken Up\n\nRelated Story Rose Leslie Doesn\\'t Want
