I\u2019m a dog chasing cars. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with one if I caught it! You know, I just \u2026 do things,\u201d his gruesomely made-up Joker insisted.\n\nHeath Ledger\u2019s Joker in The Dark Knight famously insisted he didn\u2019t have a reason or plan for the mayhem he wrought on Gotham City.\n\nAs director Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight turns 10 this week, the anniversary arrives at a time of peak Joker.\n\nFor actors who aren\u2019t comic-book nerds, Ledger kicked that door open Robert Moses Peaslee\n\nJared Leto played the bad guy as a supporting character in 2016\u2019s Suicide Squad and will have his own Joker spin-off movie with Warner Bros. (as well as a film with lover Harley Quinn). On one end of the character spectrum, Zach Galifianakis voiced the Joker for laughs in 2017\u2019s The Lego Batman Movie , while on the other, Warner Bros. also just greenlit another Joker origin film starring Joaquin Phoenix.\n\n\u201cHeath Ledger\u2019s role has had a huge impact on the Joker,\u201d says Erik Davis, managing editor of the movie site Fandango.com. \u201cThe Dark Knight redefined a film genre and Ledger\u2019s Joker redefined a character, pushing it to an interest level we\u2019re still seeing.\u201d\n\nJack Nicholson (left) and Michael Keaton in Batman (1989).\n\nThe villain, created in 1940, had been a stand-out of the DC Comics universe long before Ledger, who died in 2008 from an accidental overdose of prescription medications, posthumously earned the best supporting actor Oscar.\n\nThe Joker was famously \u2013 and campily \u2013 portrayed on TV\u2019s Batman by Cesar Romero (1966 to 1968). Jack Nicholson brought a darker, still campy Joker performance to Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 Batman, but audiences never forgot that a global superstar was playing the part.\n\nWhen Ledger\u2019s casting was announced nearly two decades later, Nolan was initially criticised for choosing an actor known for his chiselled cheekbones over contenders such as Robin Williams and Paul Bettany.\n\n\u201cThere was backlash and controversy, like, \u2018How can he be the Joker?\u2019 \u201d says Access Hollywood film critic Scott Mantz. \u201cBut Ledger\u2019s Joker and The Dark Knight were monumentally different from anything we had seen before, or have seen since.\u201d\n\nHeath Ledger as The Joker and Christian Bale as Batman in The Dark Knight.

His matinee idol looks were unrecognisable behind garish make-up and strung-out hair.\n\nThe transformation and the latitude he was given in the role was eye-opening for re-energised fans and Oscar-calibre actors like Leto and Phoenix, says Robert Moses Peaslee, co-editor of The Joker: A Serious Study of the Clown Prince of Crime.\n\n\u201cFor actors who aren\u2019t comic-book nerds, Ledger kicked that door open,\u201d says Peaslee. \u201cWith this twisted interpretation, there\u2019s so much room to play around. Ledger took it into the realm of serious project for serious actors.\u201d\n\nTroy Baker, who voices the Joker in video games such as Batman: Arkham Origins, believes there\u2019s room for more unique Joker performances but worries the influx could diminish the supervillain\u2019s mystique.\n\n\u201cNo one would be afraid of the devil if you saw him every day,\u201d says Baker. \u201cHe needs to remain in the shadows and pop out every once in a while to show that\u2019s where he lives.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_scmp_120/public/images/methode/2018/07/18/95f8fe0a-8a49-11e8-8608-b7163509a377_image_hires_133909.JPG?itok=R_uQ112_&v=1531892347", "https://assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif", "https://cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/18/a3a610a0-8a4a-11e8-8608-b7163509a377_1320x770_133909.jpg", "https://cdn1.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/07/18/d1d889f4-8a49-11e8-8608-b7163509a377_972x_133909.JPG", "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/768x768/public/images/methode/2018/07/18/2dcfd44c-8a4a-11e8-8608-b7163509a377_1280x720_133909.JPG?itok=ik6PS25y"], "top_img": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_scmp_120/public/images/methode/2018/07/18/95f8fe0a-8a49-11e8-8608-b7163509a377_image_hires_133909.JPG?itok=R_uQ112_&v=1531892347", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Usa Today"], "canonical_link": "https://www.scmp.com/culture/film-tv/article/2155780/dark-knight-turns-10-how-heath-ledgers-joker-fuelled-our-archvillain", "title": "The Dark Knight turns 10: how Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker fuelled our archvillain obsession", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Christopher Nolan\u2019s casting of Ledger was questioned \u2013 until critics saw his electrifying turn as Gotham City\u2019s mayhem maker, a performance that\u2019s led directly to A-list actors Jared Leto and Joaquin Phoenix playing the character.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SCMPNews"}, "fb": {"app_id": 282931841805811}, "og": {"title": "The Dark Knight turns 10: remembering Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker", "description": "Christopher Nolan\u2019s casting of Ledger was questioned \u2013 until critics saw his electrifying turn as Gotham City\u2019s mayhem maker, a performance that\u2019s led directly to A-list actors Jared Leto and Joaquin Phoenix playing the character.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/culture/film-tv/article/2155780/dark-knight-turns-10-how-heath-ledgers-joker-fuelled-our-archvillain", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_scmp_120/public/images/methode/2018/07/18/95f8fe0a-8a49-11e8-8608-b7163509a377_image_hires_133909.JPG?itok=R_uQ112_&v=1531892347", "site_name": "South China Morning Post"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_store_id": 623201967, "app_name": "SCMP", "url": "scmp://culture/film-tv/article/2155780/dark-knight-turns-10-how-heath-ledgers-joker-fuelled-our-archvillain?entity=node&type=article&id=2155780"}, "android": {"package": "com.scmp.newspulse", "app_name": "SCMP", "url": "scmp://culture/film-tv/article/2155780/dark-knight-turns-10-how-heath-ledgers-joker-fuelled-our-archvillain?entity=node&type=article&id=2155780"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=623201967", "keywords": "The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger, Joker", "news_keywords": "The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger, Joker", "article": {"section": "Film & TV", "tag": "American cinema", "published_time": "2018-07-18T13:39:08+08:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-18T13:39:06+08:00"}, "pocket-site-verification": "25fd909c3fd10ded451415fc076ba8", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1", "cXenseParse": {"articleid": 2155780, "author": "USA TODAY", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/768x768/public/images/methode/2018/07/18/95f8fe0a-8a49-11e8-8608-b7163509a377_image_hires_133909.JPG?itok=c12K3vP4&v=1531892347"}, "next-head-count": 43}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531892348.0, "source": "https://www.scmp.com", "summary": ""}
