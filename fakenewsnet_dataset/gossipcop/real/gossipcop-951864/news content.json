Photo: Jean-Baptiste Lacroix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nToday being Friday the 13th, Kiernan Shipka has chosen an appropriately spooky time to share a first glimpse at Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Netflix\u2019s dark, broody, and otherwise Riverdale-esque take on Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Wearing the headband that appears in the show\u2019s poster art but otherwise dressed in civvies, Shipka introduces everyone to the show\u2019s coven, including Miranda Otto and Lucy Davis as Aunts Zelda and Hilda.\n\nRoberto Aguirre-Sacasa, who created Chilling Adventures as well as Riverdale, also shared a brief teaser for the series on Twitter. There are candles, spooky trees, a big moon, and of course a pair of cat eyes (Salem lives!). The show, which was originally created for the the CW and then moved to Netflix, has been described as \u201ctonally in the vein of Rosemary\u2019s Baby and The Exorcist.\u201d It \u201cfinds Sabrina wrestling to reconcile her dual nature \u2014 half-witch, half-mortal \u2014 while standing against the evil forces that threaten her, her family and the daylight world humans inhabit.\u201d Sabrina, we get it, high school is hard for everyone.", "images": ["https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/51c/363/14785e3c64222fa2a599d22002098328df-biden-trump-pouplarity.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b33/f6e/9c0ac4241395397d44cdfcc9573bd1bed2-13-kiernan-shipka.rsquare.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b33/f6e/9c0ac4241395397d44cdfcc9573bd1bed2-13-kiernan-shipka.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/093/421/1b45dc4eae41dee8e38a404fb64a15ebbe-JacksonMcHenryFINAL.2x.rsquare.w168.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0ed/7f6/6aa72ad45d144b7e5fdb95b12f9aece95d-driverless-san-francisco.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/432/78a/817556d5a1a5ab358af1dca2d79eccaaae-Le-French-Diner-Matt-Morris.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2e2/98e/99818d3d7a6a16d9c4b41dca7a9760ec10-2423Cov-4x5-CONFLICT.w240.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b33/f6e/9c0ac4241395397d44cdfcc9573bd1bed2-13-kiernan-shipka.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry", "A Vulture Critic Covering Theater", "Film"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/take-a-spooky-first-look-at-chilling-adventures-of-sabrina.html", "title": "Take a Spooky First Look at Chilling Adventures of Sabrina", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "kiernan shipka, tv, first looks, chilling adventures of sabrina, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Take a Spooky First Look at Chilling Adventures of Sabrina", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/take-a-spooky-first-look-at-chilling-adventures-of-sabrina.html", "description": "Happy Friday the 13th.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b33/f6e/9c0ac4241395397d44cdfcc9573bd1bed2-13-kiernan-shipka.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Take a Spooky First Look at Chilling Adventures of Sabrina", "description": "Happy Friday the 13th.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b33/f6e/9c0ac4241395397d44cdfcc9573bd1bed2-13-kiernan-shipka.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-13T19:46:01.546Z", "tag": "kiernan shipka, tv, first looks, chilling adventures of sabrina", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Kiernan Shipka shares a brief first look at Netflix\u2019s new Sabrina the Teenage Witch reboot Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "kiernan shipka, tv, first looks, chilling adventures of sabrina", "author": "Jackson McHenry", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "sectionOverride": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.vulture.com/media/sites/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531511161.546, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
