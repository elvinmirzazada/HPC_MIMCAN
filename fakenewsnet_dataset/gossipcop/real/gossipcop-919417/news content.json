However, the details of his passing appear to be unsolved.\n\n\u201cBasically a feeling of like it\u2019s not fair my life\u2019s taken from me when it is,\u201d Henry, 22, says to Metz as he struggles to piece together the tragic loss. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right,\u201d she confirms.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some reference to buying a new car,\u201d he says as she reveals, \u201cHe had just gotten one before.\u201d\n\nE! Entertainment/Youtube\n\nMetz\u2019s purpose for convening with Henry is quickly vindicated as she opens up about her late friend.\n\n\u201cI was hoping to make a connection with a really dear friend who had recently passed away. He was such a generous man, happy. He brought such a light in any room, he would light up a room,\u201d she tells viewers.\n\n\u201cHe was loving and he lived his life to the fullest. And it was, of course, a shock to everyone, you know, as Tyler stated he was planning a trip and had bought a car and that of course validated that he was talking about our dear friend,\u201d she shares.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think justice has been served fully yet,\u201d Henry shares.\n\nHollywood Medium airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/tGnjVbHh7qxG9gQBoA4iN6qiKvw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/leslie-jordan-216ee38120274f4f9d9405108f3e77fd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2gnfQuhACRKZSwj0mIUg5ZtI2cM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(503x335:505x337)/Lisa-Marie-Presley-3-0111-13bc9f4826a04265850256609d8f1bf8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NC9sBVYFYux3E-KMQPPcYRt3o94=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(310x0:312x2)/boy-killed-in-stolen-car-20230201_19-39e3245123404d5e836d9aa565da7ce4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/86Ugxkphz0Qz8EHhN7uGoBBSa6M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Anne-Heche-attends-the-74th-annual-Directors-Guild-of-America-award-56-12032022-72d55df9fc834e509008027da55f0616.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/75Qge2RdE_PgAy7FTUUX2Nn7S2g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/chrissy-metz-1-2000-1-39830d703480488a810782aceace13cd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/eAtGSMhnPUsglmAYRY2gK_MLPkU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Lisa-Marie-Presley-and-Michael-Lockwood-8492534f8c2247ef92a01a5f177a94cc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/GiWdFDVeLfGIPwb2d2lk9vvFVzE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x479:1021x481)/mariska-hargitay-richard-belzer-022323-1-1a06a4a688a8476495c5db5f016b98ac.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8olrDYp7DRoYk-a2D90CgyaSNU8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1139x349:1141x351)/ice-t-richard-belzer-032423-d541639c9000496d85b132f3179e39fd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZW-4j-P1CxFGxtHqHPeheASVNKg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/abigail-spencer-greys-anatomy-wrap-celebration-021523-1-b6a246dd347449a0956aaac815ed9400.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/WZd6KdpnrmA26gyNr32wVhnzpCA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Amanda-Kloots-Reveals-Nick-Corderos-Mom-Lesley-Has-Died-011323-b912e0ece20048ab9ef614569e1cd4ee.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/u9UZ55xNvSbV5SndNy0mO0scNuI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/jenna-ortega-2-353a99cd3e6a477287ad7089cd3e46d9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4v5HjJUWYMn49JcBT18bmIWZ8q8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x239:706x241)/elvis-presley-120222-7ebadd8ffb2649f1ad33c97efa5a1b8b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/21YqvZWCVVVhkpgM1q7VG51wYnE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x9:751x11)/Civil-Rights-Probe-Launched-Over-Black-Teen-Shot-Dead-by-Police-Officer-Sitting-Behind-Him-in-Car-040623-1-f82f20edc1064b1c9d0cb792ed491232.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-mSjzF8lwxIl2XuXWPzXH0i-GB0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(554x239:556x241)/Call-Me-Kat-01-102422-f1fdc36d5f9b44039f89659d6e81406c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/ud3s3hFOKxL-ryI7sKub_C2b4yo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x419:961x421)/whitney-houston-1-c8850e3e4810413f82a9c5db6137eb2f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/BTq8JdlI8sAhBy5iET7bpU3LESo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1039x345:1041x347)/leslie-jordan-1-2000-4c8b6395060d445cb34f2b053718b305.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3fVItei6M_nSZgzmUgkOUMi3QeI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/Anne-Heche-death-accident-081622-7931d15743804e358adc970ebe54944e.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/75Qge2RdE_PgAy7FTUUX2Nn7S2g=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/chrissy-metz-1-2000-1-39830d703480488a810782aceace13cd.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/chrissy-metz-hollywood-medium-friend-died/", "title": "Hollywood Medium: How Did Chrissy Metz's Friend Die?", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Chrissy Metz meets with Tyler Henry to reconnect with a close friend who had recently died.
