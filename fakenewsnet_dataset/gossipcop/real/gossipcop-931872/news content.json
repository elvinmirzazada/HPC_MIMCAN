Us Weekly takes a look back at Glee star Lea Michele's stunning red carpet looks through the years\n\nThe theory first appeared in a Facebook Live video from the One More Thing podcast in July 2017, and it picked up steam again this week, catching the Glee alum\u2019s attention. After a fan tweeted that the actress, 31, was most likely \u201claughing her head off right now\u201d about the rumors, Michele retweeted the message and denied it in the best way.\n\n\u201cLoved READING this tweet and wanted to WRITE you back,\u201d she quipped on Thursday, March 22. \u201cLiterally laughing out loud at all this love you!!!\u201d\n\nLoved READING this tweet and wanted to WRITE you back\ud83d\ude1b literally laughing out loud at all this\ud83d\ude02 love you!!! \ud83d\ude18\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/YMHj4LCZaf \u2014 Lea Michele (@LeaMichele) March 22, 2018\n\nAnother fan joined in on the joke and asked,\u201c if ur READING this wanna tell us tour dates?! \ud83d\ude02\u2764\u2764\u201d and Michele responded: \u201cHoping to have all the info this week!\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebs Fight Back on Twitter! Stars like Gabourey Sidibe, Sarah Jessica Parker, Miley Cyrus, and Ariana Grande fight back against the haters on social media \u2014 see their classic retorts\n\nThe podcast\u2019s hosts, Jaye Hunt and Robert Ackerman, based their claims on a chapter in Glee alum Naya Rivera\u2019s 2016 tell-all book, Sorry Not Sorry. In the memoir, Rivera, 31, claimed that the Scream Queens actress complained while filming Glee when comedian Tim Conway chose to improvise a scene instead of following the script the cast had already memorized.\n\nThe podcast duo then claimed the \u201cCannonball\u201d singer\u2019s career as a child actor was to blame since she started performing at an early age and it interfered with her education. \u201cHer parents would read her her lines. And then she would, like, remember the lines,\u201d Hunt said in the video in July. \u201cSo, the idea is, she just missed school. So she never got to learn.\u201d\n\nAckerman added: \u201cShe never learned how to read. She missed that whole step.
