While we stand firmly behind the show, in light of the recent tragic events in Florida and out of respect for the victims, their families and loved ones, we feel the right thing to do is delay the premiere until later this year.\u201d\n\nThe original 1988 film told the story of two high school classmates who fall in love and exact revenge on bullies. The film\u2019s romantic lead brings a gun to school, shoots blanks at his classmates, and the female lead kills a classmate by shooting him in the chest. The climax involves the male lead, revealed to be rather deranged, trying to blow up the school. It\u2019s not clear how many of these original elements made their way into the new show.\n\nParamount has likewise canceled the show\u2019s premiere screening in New York.\n\nPreviously, Heathers drew controversy for reimagining its trio of bullies as all from traditionally marginalized groups. The showrunner defended that move to EW last month.\n\nWhile Paramount has announced the show as \u201cdelayed,\u201d the move raises a question: If the contents of the show are not appropriate to air now, why would they be appropriate to air later?", "images":
