The only hiccup? In order to get the check, he\u2019d have to pull on chords stemming from an array of umbrellas, each outfitted to either dump the money or a bucket of water on him.\n\nPlaying against So You Think You Can Dance star Stephen \u201ctWitch\u201d Boss, Ventimiglia scored big throughout the game. He confidently named the biggest drama queen in the cast of This Is Us (that would be Emmy-winner Sterling K. Brown), and navigated his way through DeGeneres\u2019 trick question about how many feet he has \u201con him\u201d (two).\n\nThe talk show host even gave him a pass when he was tasked with spelling his name backwards and missed the \u201ct.\u201d\n\nMichael Rozman/Warner Bros.\n\nMichael Rozman/Warner Bros.\n\nUnfortunately for Ventimiglia (and, well, fortunately for Ventimiglia fans), all those right answers meant he got very wet. \u201cI just wanted to make sure I was thoroughly more soaked than you,\u201d he joked to Boss.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the last question, about Jennifer Lopez\u2019s run as a fly girl in In Living Color, that Ventimiglia finally found the $10,000 (provided by Shutterfly).\n\nMichael Rozman/Warner Bros.\n\nHe was then handed a check made out to the charity of his choice, The Rape Foundation.\n\nEstablished in 1989, the group is\u201d dedicated to providing expert, comprehensive care and treatment for sexual assault victims \u2013 children and adults; prevention education programs to reduce the prevalence of sexual violence; training for police, prosecutors, school personnel and other service providers to enhance the treatment victims receive wherever they turn for help; and policy reforms and other initiatives that increase public understanding about rape, encourage victims to report these crimes, and foster justice and healing,\u201d according to its mission statement.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: This Is Us Star Milo Ventimiglia Defends Crock-Pots After Backlash Over Jack\u2019s Death: \u2018It\u2019s a Slow Cooker\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Ventimiglia is still mourning the death of his This Is Us character Jack Pearson, a scene fans got to see on Sunday night\u2019s post-Super Bowl episode. But through the character, he\u2019s learned more about life than anything.\n\n\u201cYou never know when you\u2019re going to get certain moments,\u201d Ventimiglia told PEOPLE of what he\u2019s taken away from his TV alter ego. \u201cLive life fully, love deeply and try to be happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been one to look too far in the future,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe one thing I\u2019m reminded of by Jack is to live in the present because you don\u2019t know how much time you have left. You have to give life time and know that the universe is going to give you what you need.\u201d\n\nThe Ellen DeGeneres Show airs weekdays in syndication (check local listings).", "images":
