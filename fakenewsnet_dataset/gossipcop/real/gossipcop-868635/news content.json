The six-year-old daughter of Victoria and David Beckham played with her mum\u2019s old Spice Girls dolls, with Victoria taking to her Instagram stories to share the fun with her followers. Victoria is known for her part as Posh Spice in the nineties pop group, and it looks like little Harper enjoyed playing with the mini version of her mum.\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Instagram\n\nVictoria posted three pictures of Harper\u2019s playtime for fans to see. In one photo, Harper can be seen looking at the five dolls of Posh Spice, Sporty Spice (Mel C), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) and Scary Spice (Mel B). Victoria captioned the picture: \u201cWhen u find out mummy was a pop star!! Xxx\u201d In another photo Harper is sitting on the floor holding the Baby Spice and Posh Spice dolls. Victoria wrote: \u201cSpice up your life!\u201d The third picture shows the five dolls laid out with the caption: \u201cHarper loves her Spice Girls dolls.\u201d\n\nREAD: David Beckham shares sweet photo of Harper on his motorbike: 'Take me with you Dadda'\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Instagram\n\nIt\u2019s quite a while since Victoria\u2019s Spice Girl days, so it was surely fun for mum to teach her Harper about the pop group. The fashion designer was in the world-famous group from 1994, with their debut single Wannabe in 1996. The Spice Girls sold a staggering 85million records worldwide. Geri announced her decision to leave in 1998 and two years later the band went on hiatus. Geri went on to launch a solo career, achieving four number one singles. Since then, the Spice Girls have gone on to reunite for a 2007 concert tour, and also performed together at the 2012 London Olympics.\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Instagram\n\nLast August, Victoria\u2019s husband David told Emma Bunton that he had been encouraging his wife to join them on an anniversary tour. \"For a long time she has wished us the best,\" Emma confessed during an appearance on This Morning. \"I was talking to her at David's birthday party and he said, 'You've got to do something.' Maybe she will change her mind, she does that, who knows.\"", "images": ["https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/df88b264fe53-harper-dolls-a.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4a343f3164db-harper-beckham-david-field.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/52c7206788b1-harper-a.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0eebafa00d42-harper-beckham-with-david-beckham.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/bab7706dc0f3-beckhams-nicola-peltz.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1b4d5ce0b131-harper-beckham-jadore-dior-t-shirt.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8d38aa752bfa-rebecca-loos-david-beckham.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/93e4a5083306-gettyimages-1071295138.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/fc7611bc6c6a-harper-beckham-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/fc7611bc6c6a-harper-beckham-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4321818771bd-david-beckham-victoria-premiere.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/44ff6a5ab602-harper-spice-a.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/27922cf77617-1772524225.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2c9f11209389-sophiehamilton.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/fc7611bc6c6a-harper-beckham-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sophie Hamilton", "Parenting Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2017072240825/victoria-beckham-shares-photo-harper-spice-girls-dolls/", "title": "Victoria Beckham shows daughter Harper playing with mum's Spice Girls dolls - see the cute snaps!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "title": "Victoria Beckham shares photos of daughter Harper playing with Spice Girls dolls | HELLO!", "description": "Victoria Beckham has shared sweet photos of her daughter Harper playing with her old Spice Girls dolls, saying \u2018When u find out mummy was a pop star!\u2019", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "plantilla": "Plantilla de noticias (plantilla-noticias.html)", "og": {"url": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2017072240825/victoria-beckham-shares-photo-harper-spice-girls-dolls/", "title": "Victoria Beckham shows daughter Harper playing with mum's Spice Girls dolls - see the cute snaps!", "description": "Victoria Beckham\u2019s daughter had fun with her Posh Spice doll!", "updated_time": "2017-07-22T12:17:42.000Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/author/sophie-hamilton/"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/fc7611bc6c6a-harper-beckham-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "height": 675, "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "site_name": "HELLO!"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2017-07-22T12:17:42.000Z", "published_time": "2017-07-22T12:17:42.000Z", "section": "Celebrity News", "tag": "Article,Victoria Beckham,Harper Beckham,David Beckham,Celebrity News", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/hello/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 115281558857295, "pages": 89982930077, "admins": 89982930077}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@hellomag", "title": "Victoria Beckham shows daughter Harper playing with mum's Spice Girls dolls - see the cute snaps!", "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/fc7611bc6c6a-harper-beckham-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "description": "Victoria Beckham\u2019s daughter had fun with her Posh Spice doll!", "creator": "@hellomag", "url": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2017072240825/victoria-beckham-shares-photo-harper-spice-girls-dolls/"}, "next-head-count": 36, "msapplication-TileColor": "#cc0000", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500725862.0, "source": "https://www.hellomagazine.com", "summary": ""}
