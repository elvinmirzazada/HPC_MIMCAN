{"url": "https://people.com/tv/dancing-with-the-stars-season-25-winner-jordan-fisher/", "text": "Dancing with the Stars has crowned its season 25 winner!\n\nOn Tuesday night, Jordan Fisher, Lindsey Stirling and Frankie Muniz went head-to-head on the season finale of the reality dancing competition series, but it was Fisher who was victorious and took home the coveted Mirrorball Trophy after earning overall perfect scores for his final two dances. Stirling was runner-up and Muniz was second runner-up.\n\nSpeaking moments after his big win, Fisher was lost for words to describe what it felt like to win, but had plenty to say about his partner Lindsay Arnold.\n\nEric McCandless via Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both just sort of blinded and perma-smile and stoked about everything right now,\u201d Fisher, 23, said.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t words you can use to express \u2014 there\u2019s something about putting in 12 weeks of work and time and energy and blood and sweat and tears into something and being rewarded like this at the end of the day,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cThe Mirrorball is so amazing. This is so freaking cool. But the coolest part is having what we got to establish, a bond and trust and love for each other that exceeds so much in life and that\u2019s a thing that I\u2019m taking away from this for sure.\u201d\n\nHe plans to put his trophy in the center of his family\u2019s Thanksgiving table.\n\nIt is also the first Mirrorball Trophy win for Arnold, who has competed as a pro dancer since season 16.\n\nCalling winning \u201cinsane\u2019, Arnold praised her celebrity partner. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond anything I could have ever imagined. I\u2019ve come close and to finally take it with Jordan means more than I could ever say,\u201d she said.\n\nDavid Livingston/Getty Images\n\nAdam Rose via Getty Images\n\nFisher suffered a scratched cornea two weeks ago and Arnold has injured her leg so badly it was feared she would have to drop out of the competition.\n\nThe actor said the lead up to the final had been very hard going. \u201cYesterday was definitely one of the hardest days I\u2019d say after our crazy team fall apart injury day between the knee and the eye that was rough,\u201d he said after his win.\n\n\u201cI think that yesterday was a day when we both realized we just had to leave it all on the floor and that was going to be one of those moments that really counted and today was kind of about figuring out how to be as zen and calm as possible and realize that it\u2019s out of our hands and hopefully America saw our journey and was a part of it and supported us and voted for us and they did!\u201d\n\nEric McCandless via Getty Images\n\nBut their hard work paid off in the end.\n\n\u201cYour skills are just ridiculously out of this world. But what\u2019s amazing is you\u2019re an incredible dancer, an incredible performer, but what I\u2019ve noticed the most that makes you stand out to me is what you\u2019ve done with Lindsay,\u201d judge Carrie Ann Inaba said after Fisher\u2019s final number. \u201cLindsay has actually grown as a pro with you and that is a testament to you. You are spectacular. And Lindsay, you made him spectacular.\u201d\n\nHead judge Len Goodman also praised Fisher\u2019s talent and dancing skills: \u201cI think you are the most complete male celebrity ever on Dancing with the Stars.\u201d\n\nAlthough 23-year-old Fisher was the front-runner all season, Goodman admitted ahead of the finale that he had \u201cno clue\u201d who would be named champion.\n\nEric McCandless via Getty Images\n\n\u201cThis is becoming the war on the floor because I\u2019m so excited about tomorrow evening because I have no clue who\u2019s going to win! It\u2019s just become a fantastic competition,\u201d Goodman said after Stirling performed her freestyle dance Monday, when she earned two perfect scores.\n\nFisher, who previously starred in Hamilton and Grease Live!, admitted earlier in the season that he credits actor Corbin Bleu for inspiring him to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.\n\nBleu, who was the runner-up on season 17 of the ABC show, was paired with Fisher and Arnold for their Trio Night salsa number.\n\n\u201cFrom career to the look to the personality, it\u2019s kind of like looking in a mirror. I remember watching High School Musical, he came on and I was like, \u2018Whoa! He looks like me! I\u2019ve never seen a mixed kid doing film and TV,\u2019 \u201d Fisher said of Bleu, who starred as Chad Danforth on the Disney Channel production.\n\n\u201cThat was the moment where I went, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to do. That\u2019s what I want to do,\u2019 \u201d said Fisher.\n\nWATCH: The Cost of Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Mirrorball Trophy\n\nWhile Fisher continues to amaze audiences both in front of the camera and on the dance floor, his ultimate goal is to be a husband and father one day.\n\nThe triple threat, who was adopted by his maternal grandmother and stepgrandfather \u2014 whom he calls his mom and dad \u2014 told PEOPLE that his close-knit family has inspired him to one day start a family of his own.\n\n\u201cMy adoption journey fully fuels my inspiration, my drive, what my vision of success is. My ultimate goal in my life is to have a family,\u201d he shared with PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cI want to be an incredible father, an incredible husband and take great care of my wife and all my kids and do what I love to do during the day to provide for them,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThat, ultimately, is what I see as being successful. I just aspire to be even half of how wonderful as my parents are.\u201d\n\nBut the DWTS journey is not over for Fisher and Muniz. Both the finalists will head out on the Dancing with the Stars Live! tour, which kicks off Dec. 30.
