Not that we had any doubts.\n\nWeeks after the world trek wrapped up in Seattle, Billboard reports that the Carters\u2019 co-headlining event racked in $253.5 million\u2014about $144 million more than what the original earned in 2014. The tour kicked off in early June and went on to make 18 stops in Europe, followed by 30 more in North America. The latter leg was proceeded by the release of the couple\u2019s Everything Is Love album, a nine-track effort that recently won Album of the Year at the BET Hip Hop Awards.\n\nBillboard reports Bey and Jay\u2019s tour, which featured special guests DJ Khaled and Chloe x Halle, sold 2,177,000 tickets over its four-month run, with each show grossing an average of $5.28 million. The most lucrative stop was the two-night event at Atlanta\u2019s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, grossing $14.1 million.\n\n\u201cOne of the most memorable moments for me on the On The Run II tour was the Berlin show at Olympiastadion, the site of the 1936 Olympics,\u201d Bey said in her September Vogue cover story. \u201cThis is a site that was used to promote the rhetoric of hate, racism, and divisiveness, and it is the place where Jesse Owens won four gold medals, destroying the myth of white supremacy. Less than 90 years later, two black people performed to a packed, sold-out stadium. When Jay and I sang our final song, we saw everyone smiling, holding hands, kissing, and full of love. To see such human growth and connection\u2014I live for those moments.\u201d\n\nThe On the Run II Tour is up for several Billboard Live Music Awards, including Top World Tour and Top U.S. Tour.",
