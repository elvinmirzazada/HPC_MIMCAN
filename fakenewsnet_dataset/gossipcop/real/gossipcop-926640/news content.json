It\u2019s their hilarious sense of humor that keeps things interesting between them, so naturally Teigen served up more feel-good jokes about her other half during her appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show today.\n\nInstead of flat-out roasting Legend, DeGeneres got Teigen to play a game called \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Jack About John\u201d to see how much she really knew about her husband. The funny thing is, the audience could tell right off the bat that Teigen was struggling with the trivia.\n\n\u201cWhat was the name of the band John was a part of in the movie La La Land?,\u201d DeGeneres asked her. \u201cOh, I know this one. The\u2026The? It was corny,\u201d Teigen replied.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re halfway there with The\u2026The Messengers,\u201d DeGeneres said.\n\nAfter getting most of the questions wrong, Teigen basically revealed that the problem is Legend keeps his work life pretty separate from their relationship. For example, Degeneres asked, \u201cJohn performs on the soundtrack of which 50 Shades of Grey sequel?\u201d\n\nWith the most confused look on her face, the model said she had no idea he\u2019d done a song for 50 Shades, adding, \u201cThis is a big fight we always have\u2026 He doesn\u2019t tell me about things he\u2019s producing. We went to Sundance and he was like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re showing my movie\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Your movie?! What are you talking about?!'\u201d\n\nAt least when it came down to the personal questions she should know, like Legend\u2019s middle name and what his old a capella group was called, Teigen nailed those answers.\n\n\u201cThis is good. I wasn\u2019t like a creepy stalker,\u201d Teigen pointed out. \u201cYeah, you just love him for who he is,\u201d DeGeneres added.\n\nOnce again, Teigen and Legend prove they\u2019re one of the funniest pairs in Hollywood.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180220054847im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/03023135/xoxo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220054847im_/https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hg/images/newsletter-illustration.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220054847im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/02/19040559/chrissy-teigen-john-legend.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220054847im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072554/avatar-j-150x150.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220054847im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/02/19040559/chrissy-teigen-john-legend.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Isis Briones"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180220054847/https://hellogiggles.com/news/chrissy-teigen-ellen-degeneres-quiz/", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres quizzed Chrissy Teigen about John Legend, and Chrissy failed pretty miserably", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "ellen degeneres,chrissy teigen,john legend,the ellen degeneres show,celebrity couples,john legend and chrissy teigen,Chrissy Teigen John Legend,Celeb,Celebrity Couples", "news_keywords": "ellen degeneres,chrissy teigen,john legend,the ellen degeneres show,celebrity couples,john legend and chrissy teigen,Chrissy Teigen John Legend,Celeb,Celebrity Couples", "description": "Chrissy Teigen made an appearance on Ellen DeGeneres' show where she was quizzed about her husband John Legend.
