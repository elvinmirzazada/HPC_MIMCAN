The Sex & the City star launched a shopping excursion with Airbnb on Monday, September 25, and it already sold out in just two hours.\n\nRelated: Watch Sex and the City\u2019s Never-Before-Seen Alternate Opening Credits \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 had an alternate opening credits sequence that didn\u2019t feature Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s tutu-clad Carrie Bradshaw getting splashed by a bus \u2014 watch it here\n\nThe $400 price tag for the \u201cSole in the City with SJP\u201d experience scores you a chance to have the shoe designer help you handpick a pair of shoes from her SJP Collection at Bloomingdale\u2019s, a post-shopping snack of fro yo and a ticket to the New York City Ballet show, along with facetime with SJP herself.\n\n\u201cWhat better way to meet than at Bloomingdale\u2019s 59th Street, an iconic NYC landmark, for what I hope is an unforgettable shoe-shopping experience,\u201d Parker, 52, explains on the Airbnb site. \u201cI\u2019ll help you find the perfect pair of shoes from the SJP Collection to complete your look. As we peruse the shoe department, I\u2019ll tell you about the line and how the city that never sleeps helped inspire it. Next we\u2019ll head to Forty Carrots for what some may say is the best frozen yogurt in NYC and we\u2019ll chat about my city and why I\u2019ve called it home for so many years. After that, I\u2019ll send you off in your new SJP shoes to a special evening at the exquisite and incomparable New York City Ballet. You\u2019ll have some of the best seats in the house, plus some VIP surprises. It\u2019ll be a night you won\u2019t soon forget.\u201d\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.

Sarah Jessica Parker showed Us Weekly exclusively what's in her SJP by Sarah Jessica Parker Goya and Amie totes -- get the details!\n\nConsidering a pair of her shoes retail for between $295-$545 alone, this is actually a great deal! The bad news is there were only four spots available and they\u2019re already booked. The good news that all proceeds from the experience go to help fund the New York City Ballet.\n\nGoing shoe shopping with a celebrity while giving back to the arts is something Stylish can totally get behind. Fingers crossed SJP does more of these in the future!\n\nRelated: Sarah Jessica Parker's Style Evolution Sarah Jessica Parker became a fashion icon on HBO's Sex and the City, but the trendsetter has a
