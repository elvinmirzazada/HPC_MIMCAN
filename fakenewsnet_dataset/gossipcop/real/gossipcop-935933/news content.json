their second son!\n\nThe proud mom took to Instagram after giving birth to share the exciting news, posting a photo of herself cradling her new bundle of joy in her hospital bed.\n\n\"Introducing Samuel Thomas\u2019 little brother, Isaiah Hendrix,\" Catherine, 31, captioned the sweet snapshot, along with a heart emoji.\n\nSean shared a similarly heartwarming photo of himself, lovingly gazing at his adorable newborn son hours after welcoming him into the world.\n\n\"Meet my boy Isaiah Hendrix,\" the 34-year-old former Bachelor star wrote. \"Thank you Lord.\"\n\nSean's sister, Shay Shull, was among the family members who came out to the hospital to celebrate the couple's new addition, and she shared some sweet snapshots from the exciting day to Instagram.\n\nShe also shared a video of Lowe coming out of the delivery wing to see family and friends sitting in the waiting room and announcing the sex of his new baby.\n\n\"Wanna know what we had?\" the overjoyed new father asks his visitors. \"We got a boy!\"\n\nAs the family cheers, Sean picks up the couple's 1-year-old son, Samuel Thomas, to let him know he's now got a little brother.\n\nNearly 12 hours before the couple posted their first photos of their little boy, Sean took to Twitter to reveal that he and his wife were headed to the hospital to welcome their new child.\n\n\"We\u2019re having a baby today!\" he tweeted. \"When the nurse at the front desk asked for our insurance card, I told her I also had a half off coupon and now I get to sit in the waiting room during the birth!\"\n\nCongrats to the happy new parents!\n\nThe couple -- who have been married for over four years after they first met and got engaged during Season 17 of The Bachelor -- announced they were expecting their second child back in November with a heartwarming Instagram post showing their young son sitting on Catherine's lap as she adorably tries to explain to him that she's pregnant.\n\nCheck out the video below for more on the cute couple's life as new parents.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images":
