And in this case, it\u2019s not just lip service when it comes to the need for proper representation. Not casting a Latina actress is a missed opportunity to find someone who could\u2019ve embodied this larger-than-life character because Zeta-Jones simply isn\u2019t up to the task. She\u2019s not just unconvincing; she\u2019s outlandish.\n\nAlthough the ruthlessness of \u201cThe Godfather\u201d was an inspiration for the real-life Blanco, who even named her fourth son Michael Corleone, Zeta-Jones is no Marlon Brando, unless it\u2019s by way of \u201cGrey Gardens.\u201d While she brings a certain theatrical glee to the role, she lacks the necessary menace for a woman who supposedly has the blood of over 200 people on her hands. Zeta-Jones doesn\u2019t chew the scenery so much as gum it lovingly with her put-upon accent.\n\nAnd this brings us to the brownface. While tinting Zeta-Jones\u2019 skin is thankfully kept to a minimum, the fake Colombian accent is as blatant as any costume or bronzer. There\u2019s a certain skin-crawling fascination to be had hearing her draw out the syllables of \u201clion\u201d to sound like, \u201clye-ohhn.\u201d And it doesn\u2019t help that the script is pretty darn awful either, with schlocky lines like, \u201cI care for your safety. Even a cat only has nine lives.\u201d\n\nBeyond just the performance though, Zeta-Jones isn\u2019t given much to work with to make Blanco more than a caricature. Although Blanco may have worked closely with Pablo Escobar to distribute drugs in Miami, this movie is no \u201cNarcos,\u201d no matter how hard it tries. And it does try, all the way down to a wisecracking DEA agent who provides annoying narration. \u201cCocaine Godmother\u201d has some of the same problems that Season 1 of \u201cNarcos\u201d had in trotting out the usual stereotypes and drug-trafficking cliches. Netflix\u2019s show, however, was anchored by strong performances and has evolved to explore much more nuance in its characters.\n\nHere, despite being the star of her own story, Blanco never goes beyond being happy, sad, or angry, and forget about learning anything close to the interiority of her thoughts. The superficially crass dialogue is partly to blame but so is the breakneck speed in which the movie tries to hit every one of the big events in her life. But when her life is full of psychopathic sons, disposable husbands, double-crosses, hookups, smuggling drugs, and lots and lots of murder, trying to fit all of that into two hours leads to episodic fatigue and desensitization.\n\nAs is proper, \u201cCocaine Grandmother\u201d is the Griselda Blanco show, but spending a little time fleshing out the people around her would\u2019ve also gone a long way in providing insight. Of her three grown sons, we only remember the one called Uber, probably because his name is Uber. A right-hand man named Rudy seems like he had the potential for a personality also. And the biggest waste of all is Blanco\u2019s lover Carolina (yes, Blanco was openly bisexual), who didn\u2019t amount to much more than pretty wallpaper that eventually faded.\n\nIt appears that \u201cCocaine Godmother\u201d stayed somewhat faithful to the facts, if not the actual essence of Blanco\u2019s life, so there\u2019s that. It\u2019s also not entirely unwatchable, but there are far better ways to spend your Saturday. And for those seeking a \u201cso bad it\u2019s great\u201d viewing experience, it somehow manages to fall short of those dubious charms as well. Blanco has led quite the life, and it\u2019s a shame that the time and care wasn\u2019t spent to really dig into it properly and respectfully. What a waste.\n\nGrade: D\n\n\u201cCocaine Godmother: The Griselda Blanco Story\u201d airs Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on Lifetime.", "images": ["https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Silent-Night.jpg?w=1024&h=512&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Squid_Game__The_Challenge_n_S1_E1_00_46_45_03R.jpg?w=1920&h=1079&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-78420203.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-end-of-the-fucking-world-netflix-car1.jpg?w=600&h=480&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kissinger-getty.jpeg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/devilman-crybaby.jpg?w=600&h=480&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rotten-netflix-bees1.png?w=600&h=480&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Monarch-Legacy-of-Monsters-Godzilla-TV-show-e1700258855502.jpg?w=914&h=521&crop=1", "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1777281369-e1701289656546.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/irrational-found-renewed-season-2-nbc.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fargo-Jon-Hamm-Season-5.jpg?w=1000&h=669&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cocaine_grand_mothe_color_adj_11-2.jpg?w=780", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/my-next-guest-david-letterman.jpg?w=600&h=480&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cocaine_grand_mothe_color_adj_9-2.jpg?w=3000&h=2000&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/5.jpg?w=3000&h=2700&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cocaine_grand_mothe_color_adj_13-2.jpg?w=780", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MS-S10_VTR10-Show-TP_00117_f-e1701302724490.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NUP_202805_00003.jpg?w=1000&h=750&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3_Mnuri2-1024x683-1.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screen-Shot-2023-11-21-at-2.10.36-PM.png?w=1408&h=782&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/MCDGUOF_WD008.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FRYBREADFACEANDME6-1.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cocaine_grand_mothe_color_adj_9-2.jpg", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/q3-6.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/henry-kissinger.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screen-Shot-2023-05-02-at-1.16.07-PM.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cocaine_grand_mothe_color_adj_9-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hanh Nguyen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/shows/cocaine-godmother-review-catherine-zeta-jones-griselda-blanco-brownface-lifetime-1201919603/", "title": "\u2018Cocaine Godmother\u2019 Review: Brownface Casting Is Just One of Many Insults in This Schlocky \u2018Narcos\u2019 Knockoff", "meta_data": {"description": "Catherine Zeta-Jones doesn\u2019t chew the scenery so much as gum it lovingly with her put-upon accent in Lifetime\u2019s biopic of Griselda Blanco.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400654071", "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "author": "Hanh Nguyen", "content_type": "Post", "post_id": 1201919603, "title": "\u2018Cocaine Godmother\u2019 Review: Brownface Casting Is Just One of Many Insults in This Schlocky \u2018Narcos\u2019 Knockoff", "published_at": "2018-01-20 18:05:00", "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cocaine_grand_mothe_color_adj_9-2.jpg?w=300", "comment_count": 34, "tags": "TV Reviews", "topics": "Shows", "body": "Of the many issues in Lifetime\u2019s \u201cCocaine Godmother: The Griselda Blanco Story,\u201d casting white actress Catherine Zeta-Jones to play the real-life Colombian drug lord is one of the most egregious.
