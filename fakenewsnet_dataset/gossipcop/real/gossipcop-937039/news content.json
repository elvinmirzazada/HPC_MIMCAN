The castle will serve ~food bowls~ and canap\u00e9s, so think trendy, not stuffy.\n\nIt will include:\n\nScottish Langoustines wrapped in smoked salmon with citrus cr\u00e8me fraiche, grilled english asparagus wrapped in cumbrian ham, garden pea panna cotta with quail eggs and lemon verbena, heritage tomato and basil tartare with balsamic pearls, poached free range chicken bound in a lightly spiced yoghurt with roasted apricot, croquette of confit windsor lamb, roasted vegetables and shallot jam and warm asparagus spears with mozzarella and sun-blush tomatoes.\n\n\n\nThe bowls will include:\n\nFricassee of Free Range Chicken with Morel Mushrooms and Young LeeksPea and Mint Risotto with Pea Shoots, Truffle Oil and Parmesan CrispsTen Hour Slow Roasted Windsor Pork Belly with Apple Compote and Crackling\n\n\"Luckily the seasons have just fallen perfectly and that's become the main focus in the decision making of the menus. The couple have been very involved in every detail of it,\" Mark said. Meghan and Harry finalized their menu in March after multiple tastings at Windsor Castle.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't worry, there will be *tons* of dessert, including chocolate truffles, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, biscuits with mango panna cotta topping and yellow macaroons.\n\nIf someone could ship some of those truffles to the U.S. ASAP, it'd be much appreciated.
