Look no further than Ryan Lochte and his wife Kayla Rae Reid.\n\nThe couple \u2014 who tied the knot (again!) on Sunday \u2014 first met online when the Olympic swimmer, 34, messaged the model, 27, on Instagram in 2016.\n\n\u201cShe was living in L.A. at the time and I was in Charlotte, North Carolina. I went to L.A. for training and was going out to a club. She was going out to the same club with her girlfriend,\u201d Lochte tells PEOPLE exclusively. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, maybe we\u2019ll finally get to see each other.'\u201d\n\nCHARD Photo\n\nThey indeed met face to face for the first time at the club, and \u201cwe reached out and grabbed each other\u2019s hands and were like \u2018This is you! Finally.\u2019 And we didn\u2019t want to let go,\u201d continues Lochte. \u201cOur friends were dragging us apart and that was the end of that night.\u201d\n\nThough the more traditional Reid was initially hesitant when Lochte first messaged her \u2014 \u201cHe was like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019d like to buy you a drink!\u2019 and I was like \u2018What does that mean?'\u201d \u2014 the athlete was relentless in his pursuit.\n\n\u201cI wrote back \u2018Maybe,'\u201d says Reid. \u201cAnd that was it. He was so persistent, constantly. I was like \u2018Oh fine! I\u2019ll meet with you.'\u201d\n\nWatch the full episode of People Weddings: Ryan Lochte and Kayla Rae Reid streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nCHARD Photo\n\nFor more photos of Ryan Lochte and Kayla Rae Reid\u2019s wedding day, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.\n\nAfter their night out, the couple \u2014 who are parents to 15-month-old son Caiden Zane \u2014 had their first real date and knew immediately their connection was something special.\n\n\u201cWe talked for eight to 10 hours about everything and honestly the next day we started dating,\u201d says Lochte. \u201cWe just talked about what we want in life \u2026 our goals, family, everything. I think right after that I was just like, \u2018She\u2019s the one.'\u201d\n\nThe newlyweds have already been through many ups and downs together, but Lochte says it\u2019s only made them stronger.\n\n\u201cOur lives have been a roller coaster ride with everything we\u2019ve had to deal with,\u201d says Lochte. \u201cNo matter what has happened, she\u2019s been there to pick me up. She\u2019s the one that has motivated me to keep going and to keep striving for my dreams and my goals not just in sports but in life as well. I owe everything to her.\u201d\n\nAdds his wife: \u201cRyan is one of the nicest guys I\u2019ve ever met. He doesn\u2019t have a bad bone in his body. He\u2019s a very genuine, heartfelt guy and that\u2019s hard to find.\u201d", "images":
