He also claimed that for the last 22 years it had been \u201cbiologically impossible\u201d for him to do what he was accused of, citing diabetes and a heart condition.\n\n\u201cWhen he called these women liars, and said he didn\u2019t recall meeting them and that the behavior alleged could not be attributed to him, I just felt rage and an obligation to speak publicly now,\u201d Blair said.\n\n\u201cI did not want to talk about this ever again,\u201d McAdams said. \u201cHowever, even though it is a really bad memory, I feel like some good could come from talking about it now.\u201d\n\nWhat follow are edited excerpts from the actresses\u2019 conversations with Vanity Fair.\n\nSelma Blair\u2019s representatives arranged for her to meet Toback and described him as a \u201creally interesting and odd guy,\u201d who could help her gain credibility with the indie-film crowd. (She had filmed Cruel Intentions, but it had not yet been released.) Blair\u2019s team said Toback would only meet in his hotel room; Blair insisted that they meet in the hotel restaurant. The two were meant to discuss a project Toback had written called Harvard Man , so the actress dressed accordingly\u2014a pleated Y.S.L. skirt, a grosgrain ribbon, and a cable-knit sweater.\n\nThat afternoon, I arrived at the restaurant and sat down at a table. After a bit, the hostess came up to me and told me that James Toback could not make it down, but that he wanted me to meet him in his room. Against my better judgment, I went upstairs.\n\nI was rattled, and looking back, I don\u2019t think James Toback ever planned to come down to the restaurant.\n\nI went in the room feeling a little off balance about the arrangement, but he seemed nonplussed. He pulled out the script and said, \u201cI look at you, and I see that we have a real connection. You could be an incredible actress, just by your eyes. But I can tell you don\u2019t have confidence.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d\n\nI was thinking, \u201cWhy is he trying to make me feel so uncomfortable?\u201d But I realize now he was really trying to figure out what support system I had. I answered him. My mother was in Michigan, and I had an estranged relationship with my father.\n\nJames said, \u201cYou know, I could have him killed.\u201d\n\nHe sat back in his chair and said really confidently, \u201cI do it all the time. I know people.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m even more nervous, because he\u2019s told me I have no confidence, he said he could have someone killed, and he said we had a connection\u2014which no one had said to me before in this business. I really believed that when he started to talk . . . that he was going to be my mentor. That is how he got into my brain. You know, in acting classes they get into your personal history and connect that to work. So this conversation didn\u2019t seem that strange. It seemed like he was concerned that I would not be seen as the actress I had the potential to be, and that he could do for me what he did for Robert Downey Jr.\n\nIt was about 40 minutes in and he said, \u201cWill you trust me? I cannot continue to work with you unless you trust me.\u201d He said, \u201cI need you to take your clothes off. I need you to do this monologue naked.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cWhy would my character need to be naked? She is a lawyer in a courtroom.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cBecause I need to see how your body moves. How comfortable you are with your body. This is where I start training you.\u201d\n\nI told him I was uncomfortable. But he continued to coax me\u2014saying that this was in no way a come-on. This was part of training. He wanted to make me a good actress. He wanted to make me comfortable. I thought, \u201cWell, my representation sent me to see him. He must be really important.\u201d I took off my sweater. I was so private about my body. I do remember looking down at the script and seeing my bare chest and not being able to focus on anything but the words and my face being so hot and puffy and feeling so ashamed.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6564cb9e766ac2eb76f98953/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f21d3b8f85857e9bf60831/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/l-Selma-Blair-Interview.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660159ee60bb2d438ba5ff/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6549367c1e9281b3d6f3aa93/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655291b94562f3d29015ecde/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65401263f3d909b2b29677e0/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/653fe4853b110f6e604a3200/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f2219fa923ff0fd178caa2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-selma-blair-rachel-mcadams.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65663017b09806b59b316a94/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654512a0a0aefa69f07c4c45/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654d0aa9eb254baaf96dbf60/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f21a0320586235aaecf906/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Embed-Rachel-McAdams.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/656510d0affa7b4408631071/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655e54b5bdc5e91f203294b4/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59ef7eb6556f5850638b4765/1:1/pass/James-Toback-Sexual-Assault-Accusations.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59dec8d5034e986d4cd31532/1:1/pass/All-the-women-who-have-accused-Harvey-Weinstein.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f2219fa923ff0fd178caa2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-selma-blair-rachel-mcadams.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Krista Smith With Julie Miller", "Hillary Busis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/selma-blair-and-rachel-mcadams-share-their-stories-of-james-toback-sexual-harassment", "title": "Selma Blair and Rachel McAdams Share Their Stories of James Toback\u2019s Sexual Harassment", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Both women encountered the director early in their careers.
