The Pavlovian response is that it's time to go to bed and I probably haven't done my homework,\" Evans said on his post.\n\nSlate came up with a playful response and said, \"'Probably haven't'???? Cmon, Christopher. Have you done your homework or haven't you? It's 7pm and you've had the whoooole weekend. Cmon.\"\n\nEvans decided to play along with Slate's joke. The \"Avengers\" actor asked how Slate's handwriting was and if she could write him a note, then inviting her to \"cut class.\"\n\nSlate had the best response to Evan's invite. \"This is terrifying and exhilarating. Meet me behind the gym after science. I have shark bites,\" the actress said.\n\nThe exchange of Tweets between Evans and Slate sparked rumors that the two might be getting back together. Aside from this, the two have also been spotted going on dates together which only add fuel to the rumors.\n\nLast Oct. 14, US Magazine reports that Evans and Slate went on a double date with Robert Downey Jr. and his wife, Susan Downey, at the Better Half restaurant.\n\nAccording to a witness to the two pairs' double date, Evans and Slate \"looked very much together.\"\n\nThe night before, the former couple was also spotted having dinner in Atlanta, where Evans is currently filming for a movie. According to an eyewitness, the two still looked like a couple.\n\n\"[They were] laughing. He reached across and touched her arm a couple of times. They seemed like normal people on a date,\" said the source.\n\nHowever, Evans and Slate have yet to confirm if the rumors are true, or if they have decided to just remain friends.", "images":
