She and Arie then bond about how breakups can make you reevaluate things and how you, like, totally end up hitting the gym and stuff, right? Totally! Then they make out and she straddles him while the rest of the women discuss how well their nights went.\n\nSo while Bekah mounts Arie, Krystal pulls a Trump and decides that everyone else is living in their own \u201cfalse reality\u201d and the truth is only what she believes, which is that she and Arie are the OTP\u2026and then Arie gives the date rose to Bekah. As he so eloquently puts it, \u201cYou were outstanding today and tonight you were amazing.\u201d (I can only imagine how great his wedding vows will be.)\n\nThe next day, Krystal admits that she\u2019s been hated on by \u201cjealous\u201d girls her entire life. She has struggled for so long and she\u2019s had to be SO strong and carry so much all by herself, and now, she just has to endure it one more time because she knows she and Arie will end up together. This process is just the latest thing she has to get through in order for them to be together in the end. Meanwhile, I can\u2019t wait until ABC forces her to watch this on the Women Tell All special and let me tell you: THAT will be something to endure.\n\nAs for Lauren S., she\u2019s off to Napa Valley with Arie for her one-on-one date in wine country, and she, for one, is looking forward to all the \u201ccheersing\u201d that will be happening. But the wine isn\u2019t the only great thing about this date. There\u2019s also the riveting conversation.\n\nFirst up, they discuss how early they go to bed. THEN they discuss how early they wake up. And wait, isn\u2019t it crazy how you reach a certain age and you suddenly just start wearing cardigans?! So cray.\n\nAnd if you thought that was great stuff, just wait until the dinner portion of the evening in which Lauren S. talks so much that ARIE ACTUALLY EATS. This might be the first time in Bachelor history that we\u2019ve seen someone eat on a date, and that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s bad.\n\nSitting down to dinner, Arie kicks things off by explaining that he\u2019s not a wine connoisseur, he just likes going to wineries and drinking wine. He then asks Lauren ONE question about her journey to get here, and she tells him about past relationships, her amazing friends and family, that one time her mom got an eye infection when she was in college, why she loves music, how she doesn\u2019t really know what \u201cscience\u201d is, and the fact that her last relationship lacked chemistry. Welp, I\u2019d say that last thing applies here too.\n\nBefore the night\u2019s over, she tries to rescue herself by talking SOME MORE about how she wasn\u2019t herself tonight and how she\u2019s not sure what\u2019s happening. (Surely it\u2019s not the wine you\u2019ve been drinking all day.) But in the end, Arie tells her he can\u2019t give her the rose because, to quote him, \u201cI don\u2019t even know.\u201d Same, Arie. Same. He then walks her out and says his super easy \u201cmost difficult\u201d goodbye yet.\n\nBack at the house, Lauren\u2019s luggage is taken away, and Krystal takes it upon herself to perform some sort of funeral for Lauren\u2019s \u201cbeautiful soul\u201d before offering the other women the never-before-heard advice to make the most of their time, and Caroline has had enough of it. As Lauren\u2019s friend, Caroline is done with Krystal and the fact that she thinks she can be condescending to everyone just because \u201cyou met his dog.\u201d (Next: Who let the dogs out?)", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081506im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/2332_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081506im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/article-covers/2332_106821743_2017_04_07_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081506im_/https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/147763_7383.jpg?w=2000", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081506im_/https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/147763_7383.jpg?crop=0px%2C274px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081506im_/http://ew.com/img/sign-up-bg.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081506im_/https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/147763_7383.jpg?crop=0px%2C274px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Highfill"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081506/http://ew.com/recap/the-bachelor-season-22-episode-3/", "title": "The Bachelor recap: Season 22, Episode 3", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "The Bachelor, The Bachelor recap, The Bachelor season 22, Arie Luyendyk Jr", "news_keywords": "The Bachelor, The Bachelor recap, The Bachelor season 22, Arie Luyendyk Jr", "description": "Week three involves wrestling, dogs, and two women getting sent home early.", "og": {"title": "'The Bachelor' recap: The women give wrestling a try", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081506/http://ew.com/recap/the-bachelor-season-22-episode-3/", "description": "The women give wrestling a try, and Annaliese unveils yet another childhood trauma", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081506im_/https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/147763_7383.jpg?crop=0px%2C274px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://ew.com/recap/the-bachelor-season-22-episode-3/", "description": "Week three involves wrestling, dogs, and two women getting sent home early.", "media": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/147763_7383.jpg?crop=0px%2C274px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081506im_/http://ew.com/recap/the-bachelor-season-22-episode-3/", "title": "'The Bachelor' recap: The women give wrestling a try", "description": "Week three involves wrestling, dogs, and two women getting sent home early.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180116081506im_/https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/147763_7383.jpg?crop=0px%2C274px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
