(Warning: Spoilers ahead!)\n\nRebecca decided to surprise Kate by attending her first singing gig\u2014but rather than appreciate her mother's support, Kate lashed out and unleashed years of anger in the process. \u201cYou still make me feel like a stupid, fat little kid,\u201d Kate admitted after Rebecca said she sang \"incredibly beautifully\"\u2014a word choice that set off Kate. Dumbfounded by her daughter's accusation, Rebecca asked what she had ever done to make her feel that way, and all Kate could could say was, \"You existed.\" Ouch.\n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, Kate followed it up by telling her mother that she only wanted a daughter like herself, and she was never going to be that. \"No, you wanted me to be the you that you never became.\" Rebecca remained impressively calm and collected, telling her daughter that she had nothing to say because, \"I can't think of anything that would be quite that terrible. You and your brothers are my entire life.\u201d\n\nSo what provoked Kate to lash out like that? With too many questions and not enough answers, we asked executive producer and co-showrunner Isaac Aptaker to fill us in.\n\nGlamour: My jaw was on the floor with some of the things Kate said to Rebecca. Did you discuss how far you were willing to push their conversation? Or what damage this could do to their relationship?\n\nIsaac Aptaker: We're very fortunate we have a lot of brilliant female producers and writers on our staff who have wonderfully complicated relationships with all of their mothers. [Laughs] So, we had a lot of personal experience and real stories to draw from. Dan Fogelman wrote that episode with Bekah Brunstetter, who is one of our writers, and they did such a good job capturing how much love is there, but how much pain these two women have caused each other over the years, and continue to inadvertently cause each other. It's a long scene, and there's a lot to it. These episodes are only 42 minutes, [so in editing] we wondered if there was anywhere to make a cut, but Mandy and Chrissy are just so good, and we found it so compelling that we left it pretty much untouched. I think that was the right decision.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42a9c240b1e16740eaf72/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/NUP_175597_0631.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42af251512378d5b0c01a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-10-03%2520at%25205.27.06%2520PM.png", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_800%2Cq_80%2Cw_800/v1617814526/glamour_mandy-moore-and-milo-ventimiglia-find-their-celebrity-birthday-twins.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/65454b034a2f0cd45af5fefa/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/64cd37f7f2d4984422dd4ba1/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/654d65e312a53b34fb708974/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/636d76354acdeaf03c789f16/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6564d2808e843e41a3d82eeb/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6542dfe0fb0f38a67fc72589/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/655d051747e5e7e78214ae4a/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Jessica Radloff", "October"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/the-story-behind-kate-and-rebecca-fight-on-this-is-us-season-two-episode-two", "title": "The Story Behind Kate and Rebecca's Explosive Fight on 'This Is Us' Season Two Episode Two", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "This Is Us co-executive producer Isaac Aptaker reveals the story behind Kate and Rebecca's explosive fight in episode two.", "id": "59d422eba05bb4492d981b2b", "keywords": "this is us,tv,mandy moore,chrissy metz,isaac aptaker", "news_keywords": "this is us,tv,mandy moore,chrissy metz,isaac aptaker", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59d422eba05bb4492d981b2b", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"This Is Us co-executive producer Isaac Aptaker reveals the story behind Kate and Rebecca's explosive fight in episode two.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "There's more to their complicated relationship than we've seen so far.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "The Story Behind Kate and Rebecca's Explosive Fight on Tonight's 'This Is Us'", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/the-story-behind-kate-and-rebecca-fight-on-this-is-us-season-two-episode-two"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-10-04T02:01:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-04T02:01:00.000Z", "author": "Jessica Radloff"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "There's more to their complicated relationship than we've seen so far.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "The Story Behind Kate and Rebecca's Explosive Fight on Tonight's 'This Is Us'"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d42d907657e1364ce55a03/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-kate-pearson-singing.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507082460.0, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
