I kind of live in the moment. I don't think people in New York will annoy me, and I feel like when I go there, I'll meet lifelong friends. Stuff like that,' he added.\n\nI'm nervous, and my mum's upset about me leaving\n\nTwo words Brooklyn: Beer pong.\n\nGetty Images\n\nDespite his mother's anguish at her eldest child moving out, the British-born star admits his parents have always been supportive of his photography endeavours.\n\n'I do backstage photography at my mum's shows,' the teenager told the publication.\n\n'And I mean, I love doing it\u2014but my mum's like, \"Go take pictures of the models!\" and I'm a bit shy. So I kind of have to get the first two out of the way, and then I'm used to it,' he added, weeks after the release of his first photography book, What I See.\n\nBrooklyn's comments comes days after David Beckham's Instagram posts which show him building Harper a Disney princess castle.\n\nAfter pulling an all-nighter earlier this week to finish the project, David posted a snap of himself - topless - captioning the snap: '1am done... Someone's gonna have a nice surprise in the morning.'\n\nThis family is too cute right now.\n\nRelated Story David Beckham Builds Disney Castle For Harper", "images":
