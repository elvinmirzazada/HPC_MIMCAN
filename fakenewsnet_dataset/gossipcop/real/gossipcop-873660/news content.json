Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nFans were quick to speak out against the sketches.\n\nOthers compared the artwork to other celebrity courtroom sketches.\n\nSome even accused the artist of being a Katy Perry fan. (The two singers have some bad blood.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKandyba said he did practice sketching Swift ahead of time, but it can be more difficult creating a still image in his mind of a person who is moving around.\n\n\"It's hard. Some people are just much easier to draw than others,\" Kandyba said. \"If you give me somebody with a beard and glasses \u2014 bingo \u2014 got it.\"", "images":
