I called my agents and said, \u2018Please don\u2019t send me any more scripts; I need to explore other avenues.'\u201d\n\n\u201cThey respected me and didn\u2019t send me anything for almost a year until Big Little Lies,\u201d Woodley said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was or who was involved, I just said, \u2018Thanks, I\u2019m still not interested.'\u201d\n\nHer refusal to read the script might have ended things before they began, but her agents insisted she read it before she said no, telling her Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern were involved.\n\nHilary Bronwyn Gayle/Courtesy HBO\n\n\u201cI read it, fell in love with it, and Laura, who I had worked with on The Fault in Our Stars, called me and that was really the push,\u201d she said.\n\nSlaven Vlasic/Getty\n\nWhile Woodley says she \u201cwouldn\u2019t change\u201d the Divergent series \u201cfor the world,\u201d she reveals filming the last one \u201cwas a bit of a hard experience for everyone, and that was really what made me think I need to have some human experiences outside of this industry and fall in love with acting again, and Big Little Lies did that for me.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

She also isn\u2019t ruling out any other alternative paths to acting and teases that she might be interested in pursuing politics one day.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be running in 2020, but it\u2019s never something I would rule out,\u201d Woodley said.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/iApsvzxqqye-JI7LpDBF6GhFiU4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/shailene-woodley-jack-whitehall-robots-042523-2-bfc5b35c98fc4694bb977fe91d10ebc4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4AK_V-ImttNlJKcgnCO_53h1WBA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x309:706x311)/Shailene-Woodley-adidas-stella-mccartney-021423-35592b1d1d144ff79c57d5c7fa1143d8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/EJ7dtNBHo58YrZNQoTIAq3H94Y8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(710x110:712x112)/Scarlett-Johansson-Nearly-Quit-Acting-After-Losing-Gravity-Role-to-Sandra-Bullock-061423-4cff6851689147d397577361b0a34369.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/gel75gBPfCdy3Ob-1k2kIaTzFXs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(314x239:316x241)/Shailene-Woodley-Aaron-Rodgers-399377af392945f698ee536155d5262f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1jEFTDsMjqd7YiAQr0UP93bWi6s=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1099x585:1101x587)/sam-neill-jurassic-park-032423-b24c4d8f9eb94558adcd6a9d6cd00953.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/gRoeNBS25Q1nRZmohEiOI28wcGY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x345:981x347)/aaron-rodgers-shaliene-woodley-2000-718b2b1189a04e6a9c3933a662c6c94a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/EZ-DdeWcLlAb_bAeKcbYtZ2-CMc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/harrison-ford-brad-pitt-on-set-awkwardness-060223-tout-218f5e5c89ab446680f972526d0a4642.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rNgB2AvVEJfGUBFWYpooVavUBWA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/LauraDern_DianeLadd-0-bc026832395a4b5c888c98a0f6cae84c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/Lt40WHuoj8U-ewaotQdapk4e-x0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(629x309:631x311)/riley-keough-122222-2-41ab10081ea1445bbfdc4c2279c53468.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ws4OMmF__rR4GdSNkSHj_Y6x594=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(659x379:661x381)/Elle-Fanning-instagram-followers-01-051123-03d068cf29a34ca7b1a1e9bf23ba1cf1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jq4ce9xWypcEbS7kY9s6aeunM_I=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/luke-evans-our-son-exclusive-061223-tout-cf625d5abf1f4b2eaf86aa8114d16f94.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/fx9K6RsJq1a2jJWgpUH6dNOGCwY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/shailene-woodley-1-2000-6a342208bf54486684c10f4568053258.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8dup4NwtUXGOsQ90JF4E9Aq-0yQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(819x292:821x294)/ll-cool-j-ncis-051723-1-40334cfa0ce348f3add9172b0d8ad185.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/pB61Pv1yBwJty1K-EDYngdhMg58=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(587x7:589x9)/SHAILENE-WOODLEY-2-9e627665e67c467d85f7cc42ab7073b7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Y6Q_R59pnKfjRs4ZfdGFbj45R7w=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x494:921x496)/emma-watson-9c75792fc3df47489324751a019475e3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jmn04AvbU72lNFA1XcclRq5IaxY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Zoe-Kravitz-Says-Big-Little-Lies-Is-Unfortunately-Done-After-Director-Jean-Marc-Valee-Death-111622-f328c7eff0a74098976156426d0476a1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0g23rsLkmd8XvPIQTcwVia7o7G0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/647343-6bcc713a7ef94bd098da4e406d580839.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qmcTZnXNxhm0MBhDd0YwvoVFmr8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(750x114:752x116)/laura-dern-treat-williams-061323-40b51a28d51a44198cef8a07a025da9c.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/fx9K6RsJq1a2jJWgpUH6dNOGCwY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/shailene-woodley-1-2000-6a342208bf54486684c10f4568053258.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexia Fern\u00e1ndez"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/shailene-woodley-almost-quit-acting-before-big-little-lies/", "title": "Shailene Woodley Reveals She Almost Quit Acting Before Starring in' Big Little Lies'", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"There was a point in my life, right before Big Little Lies, where I had hit a wall with acting.
