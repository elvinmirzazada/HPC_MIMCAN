E! reports the two have been dating for two months and that they went to neighboring high schools in Florida but reconnected recently in New York City. Mendes, in a new interview with Nylon, talked a bit about a \"prospect\" that\u2019s likely Houston and why she\u2019s sworn off dating actors.\n\n\"No, [the guy I\u2019m dating isn\u2019t an actor], and that\u2019s, I think, why it\u2019s so great,\" she told the outlet. \"It\u2019s somebody completely out of the industry. It\u2019s funny because I\u2019m more hesitant to talk about it because I don\u2019t want him to read this... I actually would totally talk about it right now, if I didn\u2019t feel like, Wait, he might read this.\u201d\n\nBut Mendes went on, particularly about why actors aren\u2019t a good match for her: \"It\u2019s just dating people in the industry is tough,\" she said. \"I did for a little bit. I\u2019ve just dated actors. It\u2019s hard when that\u2019s your world. You only meet people through work and that can be really tough, because you\u2019re not necessarily meeting people that you\u2019re similar to. It\u2019s just people that you\u2019re with because you\u2019re working on the same project. I\u2019ve learned to not do that. Thank god nothing bad has ever happened from those experiences. I realize that I don\u2019t think I like actors. Actors are really emotionally complicated. You would think they would be more in tune with their emotions, but sometimes they\u2019re just not. I just really need to get out of this industry with someone who is in a stable environment.\u201d\n\nMendes has shared one photo of Houston on her official Instagram so far, where he\u2019s kissing her cheek alongside photographer Barron Roth. Houston also appears in her recent Instagram story of them in the Hamptons' Montauk for her 24th birthday weekend:\n\nBut Houston has made things more Instagram official between the two on his page: he\u2019s shared two photos with Mendes\u2014one where he calls her \"baby,\" another where he calls her \"beautiful\"\u2014and she\u2019s liked each. She added a smile and heart emoji to one, which is pretty solid dating confirmation on the 'gram.\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram", "images":
