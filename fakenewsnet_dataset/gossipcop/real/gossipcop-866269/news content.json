The hardest thing is seeing pain on someone\u2019s face that you caused, and then have to deal with yourself,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cSo, you know, most people don\u2019t want to do that. You don\u2019t want to look inside yourself. And so you walk away.\u201d\n\nJAY-Z never walked away from his own marriage, but it hasn\u2019t always been easy.\n\nRELATED: JAY-Z Confesses His Relationship With Beyonc\u00e9 Was Not \u2018Built on the 100 Percent Truth\u2019\n\nSince 2013, the musician has been dogged by cheating rumors, which were only compounded by the news of his notorious 2014 #elevatorgate squabble with sister-in-law Solange after the Met Gala. Beyonc\u00e9 more than hinted at marital strife on her 2016 adultery-fueled visual album Lemonade \u2014 and JAY-Z finally alluded to being unfaithful on the title track of his latest album, 4:44, released in June.\n\nJAY-Z, 47, told T that therapy helped him look inward.\n\n\u201cI grew so much from the experience,\u201d the rapper (born Shawn Carter) said. \u201cBut I think the most important thing I got is that everything is connected. Every emotion is connected and it comes from somewhere. And just being aware of it. Being aware of it in everyday life puts you at such a \u2026 you\u2019re at such an advantage.\u201d\n\nThe artist \u2014 nominated for eight awards at the 2018 Grammys \u2014 said he built up walls due to experiences from his childhood.\n\n\u201cYou go into survival mode, and when you go into survival mode what happen? You shut down all emotions. So even with women, you gonna shut down emotionally, so you can\u2019t connect [because of the way you feel about yourself],\u201d he said. \u201cIn my case, like it\u2019s, it\u2019s deep. And then all the things happen from there: infidelity \u2026\u201d\n\nJason Miller/Getty\n\nJAY-Z acknowledged problems in their relationship informed both Lemonade and 4:44.\n\n\u201cWe were using our art almost like a therapy session,\u201d he said of the music, adding that playing the deeply personal tracks for one another was painful \u2014 and \u201cvery, very uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nWhile the A-list pair were working on their respective albums \u2014 and a joint album they had previously been working on \u2014 emotions were running high.\n\nMyrna Suarez/WireImage for Parkwood Entertainment\n\n\u201cWe were sitting in the eye of that hurricane,\u201d JAY-Z said. \u201cThe best place is right in the middle of the pain. And that\u2019s where we were sitting. And it was uncomfortable. And we had a lot of conversations. You know. [I was] really proud of the music she made, and she was really proud of the art I released. And, you know, at the end of the day we really have a healthy respect for one another\u2019s craft. I think she\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 Instagram\n\nToday, it seems, JAY-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 are doing better than ever. Already parents to 5-year-old daughter Blue Ivy, the couple welcomed twins Rumi and Sir in June.\n\n\u201cIt is not a secret that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay had huge problems a couple of years ago. It was obvious to everyone that spent time with them,\u201d an insider told PEOPLE this summer. \u201cThere was always tension in the air, but they both worked very hard to get to the place where they are now \u2026 They are very excited about adding babies to the family. Jay was great during Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s pregnancy and continues to be great. He loves being a dad and Beyonc\u00e9 seems very happy.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/9SbUo4auuP8IR_0eWQk3kYOzxLQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(359x259:361x261)/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West-b441a14265974ce8bff283645d822271.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/doQ4rVAEQ2mK9k7mei5-KwnYoNc=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jeff-Nelson_selects-10-85889a30a8544ebba85c86033bc5b46a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/x3JbSnORo6488OOGTAtlBVNoShk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x369:706x371)/jay-z-edf6090ede3c4547a47da0cf9c633778.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/6MO-CnaBY3-pqgRoOEJfcw4IMy8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/jayz-beyonce-11-2000-4c80ff7a2c17409e8be32372bd29b6c2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/WLS7ofyd_O98zAl7Faw0tQnUMrA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/beyonce-jay-z-20001-1-ba4234dcfce048d389f2c1f433806372.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/TspvRk7mvZUBcS95iexPNybxWE0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(780x339:782x341)/nick-cannon-2000-8d65c032a1c84687a60f9a41e5e86f87.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/KFpGa7mDiFEJXhE29GcWtM_vdpg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Miley-Cyrus-Flowers-Video-Thumbnail-e8f75b28374449fcb54e4172e398098b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7KxFFQe9XAbTSGBJWPcEpYn91LE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x689:941x691)/beyonce-jay-z-kids-1-c8a22b0de04a4afaa0d72bf87b890102.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3r2Ee6XTAMRZm1T4MVed1XWOIpY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x9:736x11)/spike-lee-beyonce-021423-cedb4fb7820d4e988cb786964b16e8e0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tZXVAjMWN9Zb-hLxxseJbA3Dnv8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/beyonce-jay-z-nba-47b5e19aa88543fcbf34dc61267fc601.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/IWb1PhGUyjutipI1t2kNh7LobtI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/jeanbatistetaylorswift11252019-35-805ac35984ea4992a579a3d3c8b33b9f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HizgVb3oBsnxqn8DtyHCcSH6OLw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(859x385:861x387)/Megan-Fox-and-Machine-Gun-Kelly-040423-2000-8ff57dc3d4e8418bbb025a93215d628a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/z0GFw5UEpG8GGKXast9l5ipJP5o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(839x385:841x387)/beyonce-jay-z-020623-01-2000-a1ca9f329c9e4c639b9c84fe06a200e4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/gCLF46fn28GBJIvzcoJ8o3L578Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(539x0:541x2)/beyonce-4-136e2f42ee8e44ed9aa798178de0e6c0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/6WBC212jhXvoWftQrjyifu9SoSw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kelly-clarkson-01-0526-32119ae9f47e41c986c9f90572f486dc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/xpVPZdHXflkoPqzd2HyUenFEv1M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/mgk-fox-2-88d62bb3e8e045169ff5d50bdc058a22.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/aRRpoEd902Zy-W2SWwN2G6BYUK0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/beyonce-jay-z-2000-1-ec59cb4c1e574a84b93efdca95a6a710.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lROz3n_GQ7r7VJXK9ilEk5NjHN4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Jack-Harlow-Eminem-040123-b174bce9e31b4b728525d63a3d589916.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4xRZeO4KuTYvpa3-rbXaGeOeRbc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(359x299:361x301)/Rita-Ora-Beyonce-01-120122-bd3caa8ec2a94795bf22ae36b68b2d75.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/fAASDhH6bUBmq_UFYQiTdzONJmU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(577x419:579x421)/bad-bunny-45796b0fcdd043729be39c89862b50f1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Ro3KytBEXQS6vEGYXt0ZI_y0loo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/vanderpump-rules-season-10-trailer-100722-4-ff0dc0fc6e8f41c19319fbeec217c12d.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/WLS7ofyd_O98zAl7Faw0tQnUMrA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/beyonce-jay-z-20001-1-ba4234dcfce048d389f2c1f433806372.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeff Nelson", "Jeff Nelson Is The Senior Music Editor At People.
