Much like Duggar, the character on the episode is the star of a reality show about a large religious family\u2014this time called 13aker's Dozen. The story line also included issues of molestation in the family and the attempt by the parents to handle the problems on their own.\n\n03 of 13 SVU \"Devil's Dissections\" (Season 17, Episode 1). Inspired by: Robert Durst's murder allegations Orleans Parish Sheriffs Office via Getty Images;Michael Parmelee/NBC/ Law & Order: Special Victims Unit opened its 17th season September 2015 by taking inspiration from real estate heir Robert Durst.

I think I killed that woman and cut her up.\"\n\n04 of 13 SVU \"American Disgrace\" (Season 16, Episode 2). Inspired by: Jay-Z and Solange's elevator fight Michael Parmelee/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank; Larry Busacca/WireImage Law & Order: Special Victims Unit worked in a reference to Solange and Jay-Z's famed 2014 post-Met Ball elevator fight in the beginning of the 16th season. While much of the story line focused on an athlete who had fallen out of favor, the two performers (Henry Simmons and Kelley Missal) were worked in with a scene in which the athlete was seen in an elevator's security footage, being attacked by one of his female associates after wronging her.\n\n05 of 13 SVU \"American Tragedy\" (Season 15, Episode 3). Inspired by: Paula Deen's downfall Michael Parmelee/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/ Peter Kramer/NBC/NBC NewsWire In Law & Order: Special Victims Unit's 15th season, the show combined the events of Trayvon Martin's death with the scandal involving Paula Deen's use of racial slurs. The teenage boy who died in the episode was shot by a blonde celebrity chef with a history of racism.\n\n06 of 13 SVU \"Funny Valentine\" (Season 14, Episode 16). Inspired by: Chris Brown's domestic violence incident with Rihanna WireImage/Michael Parmelee/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images The horrendous 2009 domestic violence that allegedly took place between Chris Brown and Rihanna served as inspiration for Law & Order: Special Victims Unit's 14th season.

Inspired by: The trial of Casey Anthony Will Hart/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank; Red Huber-Pool/Getty Images Hilary Duff guest-starred in a 2009 episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit that took clear direction from Casey Anthony and the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. In SVU's take, the little girl's grandmother called authorities to report her disappearance, leading to a trial.\n\n08 of 13 Criminal Intent \"Bombshell\" (Season 6, Episode 20). Inspired by: The life and death of Anna Nicole Smith WireImage/Virginia Sherwood/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images An episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent's sixth season took inspiration from the life of the late Anna Nicole Smith. The bombshell in the episode is a blonde woman who marries an older billionaire. Much like the tragedy of Smith and her late son Daniel Smith, the woman died after the death of her son.\n\n09 of 13 Law & Order \"In Vino Veritas\" (Season 17, Episode 7). Inspired by: Mel Gibson's mid-'00s breakdown Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department via Getty Images/ Virginia Sherwood/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Nodding to a similar alleged incident that took place with Mel Gibson in 2006, a Season 17 episode of Law & Order featured a character played by Chevy Chase. The man in question was a somewhat washed-up actor who got pulled over by police and hurled anti-Semitic insults at those detaining him.\n\n10 of 13 Criminal Intent \"Masquerade\" (Season 6, Episode 6). Inspired by: The death of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey Virginia Sherwood/NBCU Photo Bank / Helen H. Richardson/ The Denver Post Law & Order: Criminal Intent took on the shocking death of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey in 2006, 10 years after the little girl was killed at the age of 6. The episode focused on the death of a child beauty queen, much like Ramsey, and the confusing investigation that ensued.\n\n11 of 13 SVU \"Sick\" (Season 5, Episode 19). Inspired by: Michael Jackson's child abuse allegations Kevork Djansezian-Pool/Getty Images/ Will Hart/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank A character in the fifth season of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit was a wealthy man who had sleepovers with children much like those described in the mid-'00s trial of Michael Jackson.\n\n12 of 13 Law & Order \"True Crime\" (Season 13, Episode 3). Inspired by: The death of Kurt Cobain essica Burstein/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images/ Frank Micelotta/Getty Images A season 13 episode of Law & Order featured a rock-star couple who took inspiration from Courtney Love and the late Kurt Cobain. While the story went in a different direction when the character who mirrored Love ended up passing away in the episode, there was a story line involving Cobain's character's band and the rockers' relationship to the deceased female performer.", "images":
