Abby fans are incredible, they really are the best. I can\u2019t imagine a fan group being any better than that.\u201d\n\nShe continues, \u201cThey really make me smile. My fans are funny and they\u2019re smart and they\u2019re kind and they\u2019re caring and they\u2019ve been so supportive. Not only of Abby, on the show, but of me, of Pauley. I love them. I\u2019m proud of the group of fans that Abby has attracted because it\u2019s a pretty amazing group of people.\u201d\n\nThe finale picked up after Abby and M16 agent Clayton Reeves (played by Duane Henry) landed in the hospital after a mugging gone wrong. While Abby survived being shot in the chest, Reeves succumbed to his injuries. Abby announced that she would be leaving NCIS in order to continue Reeves\u2019 legacy and start a charity in honor of his mom.\n\nAt the end of the video, Perrette addresses her fans directly, \u201cTo all the fans around the world, I want to tell you, with all of my heart, how much I love you guys. How grateful I am, for all of your support of both Abby and me over all of these years. And just to remember, with me, everything that Abby\u2019s given to us. And everything she\u2019s taught us. I cannot thank you enough. I am so blessed to have fans like you and it means everything to me. Thank you.\u201d\n\nCliff Lipson/CBS via Getty\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

It\u2019s like Abby has raised a couple of generations of young girls and has inspired this international phenomenon of young women going into math and science and STEM programs because she made it accessible, cool, attainable and fun.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s a scholarship that is going to make Abby live forever in the real lives of these young people that find out about this.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/aSq17caqwbll4UNqlzEuI9Br2cQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(646x159:648x161)/Melissa-Benoist-2000-db8899403d3d4c35b516b4c159b82eb7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lH1SmoAHfNqVOfwy_dYL64_YXa0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(314x149:316x151)/Dave-Grohl-Taylor-Hawkins-3-f22861e806324567967d33241c333699.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lT4lGjBQsA0_rDZXskQjVFxloWw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(899x505:901x507)/ted-lasso-cast-1-7367d0ab833e43e6a75b4803a93152d9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/S2kjyfu6hFgqP3kpavqQ2Yu9HZY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(308x0:310x2)/image-aa9ffcbc669943c5b54986650fe872d5.png", "https://people.com/thmb/yEB-rh3xXu6IgttjcClIsWIXIxA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x9:676x11)/The-Office-Stars-Celebrate-10-Years-Since-Series-Finale-051623-1-0e9e9a51f44b4fb4a0223014d12de5ab.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/cGLCjnDNB-6IdbCpCn9JzGp13rE=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/headshot-d1a12648293f4e51afa323df912ec592.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/W0bKfHWk0t5EQSB6L2ubQIt2O-8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(635x0:637x2)/pauley-perrette-04fbe684ef6145979fd365377fc940a1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/EXei_jf88QyMfyTZtpddtqWcBO4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/pauley-perrette-ncis1-1-e13019ae93f440b89f62add7796c6885.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/GaMsTLpf8dZMeaOZGtA1YPv-uSE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x398:961x400)/marvelous-mrs-maisel-cast-3db5f58c651546be8ad8e699b83cf1af.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3cFDDGNTjzLFQDsiEn_XtTdDvgc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/manifest-052923-2-e6b4d52c9153469684267f6fe74c5130.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/PUQMjlG1-e4-vGGOqAiU5GX_TbE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/emily-van-camp-e3113896db164454800df8823399080d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/Q-iFvpzZqTP5dLdcEpXjaX71Zxs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x359:736x361)/pauley-perrette-project-angel-food-090622-e264295520344ea1abf4eca9a96785e0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0-kDZnuBIJDK5bFxiHv7OUakyBg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/CHICAGOMED11162022-32-92613a7d447941a088d3e2078b38a4b9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3EJCiuJhO0mM73W9IOBjeJVPDmk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kelly-mccreary-paleyfest-la-2023-greys-anatomy-040323-1-5147345b24974137a87c6423443ce2e0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7mhc4so8-iA1Oi2gApHRq9R5MdQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x259:721x261)/keanu-reeves-john-wick-4-sxsw-031423-3796fb7939f648cfb35087a725057862.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/EFq3GcoziuT8efZz-SxZHu8D4No=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/mayim-bialik-leslie-jordan-040423-2-43219d9fd1694524b65f770ceb7d421a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8dup4NwtUXGOsQ90JF4E9Aq-0yQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(819x292:821x294)/ll-cool-j-ncis-051723-1-40334cfa0ce348f3add9172b0d8ad185.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/VzR5Sab96rRaPCRdU8ciKULEuVs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(859x252:861x254)/ncis-la-finale-season-14-fianle-051923-3-964c3a7a66094e2d8c22795889ea4f19.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HYnJhXrx88AcyP2MsD0U0v5HdRg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1154x339:1156x341)/NCIS-LA-Final-Season-02-012023-4768e250f7904f2aa966156e3b7006aa.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/S2kjyfu6hFgqP3kpavqQ2Yu9HZY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(308x0:310x2)/image-aa9ffcbc669943c5b54986650fe872d5.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brianne Tracy", "Brianne Tracy Is A Staff Editor At People.
