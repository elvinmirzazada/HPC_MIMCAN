Look out for the cover reveal on 6/4. A post shared by Playboy (@playboy) on Jun 3, 2017 at 6:30pm PDT\n\n\"In the spirit of celebrating the women who\u2019ve made Playboy what it is \u2013 an exuberant celebration of beauty, sex, and the beauty of sex \u2014 we invited seven special Playmates from over the years to come back and recreate their iconic covers. In the process, they remind us that beauty is ageless, sex appeal is timeless and exuberance is eternal,\" notes the article.\n\nAnd frankly, we couldn't agree more. Take a look, for example, at Kimberley Conrad Hefner (former wife of Hugh Hefner and mom of Cooper, as well as Marston), in her 1988 cover, and today.\n\nConrad Hefner, who was raised partially in West Vancouver, was 26 at the time of her original shoot \u2014 she's now 54 and divorced from Hef, but still has fond memories of her time at the Mansion.\n\n\"There was a common misconception that I put the kibosh on the partying at the Mansion. It had nothing to do with me. The Playmates still came over, but it was nice to have them call and say, \u2018Hi! I\u2019m coming up!\u2019\" she told the publication.\n\nRenee Tenison was the magazine's first African-American Playmate of the Year in 1990.\n\nShe was 22-years-old at the time, and is now 49.\n\nOf course, it's somewhat ridiculous it took until that point to have any diversity on the cover, but Tenison remembers a different kind of squabble.\n\n\"When I did Playboy, there was a little bit of controversy because I was the first African-American Playmate of the Year and some women were saying I was being objectified. But I said, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re pro-choice, shouldn\u2019t I have the right to choose what I want to do?\u2019 .. If you look back, all the big models from Christy Turlington to Naomi Campbell posed nude. I see it as art. Not everybody sees it that way, but that\u2019s how I see it,\" she told the magazine.\n\nLisa Matthews, billed as the \"all-American girl,\" took on the task in June 1991.\n\nShe was 22-years-old at the time (perhaps that's the magic Playboy cover model number?), and is now 48.\n\nThen there's Candace Collins, who has the oldest cover in the bunch.\n\nShe was 22 at the time of her December 1979 photo, and is now 60. She started out working at the infamous Playboy Clubs in St. Louis and Chicago, reports Chicago Magazine, and eventually graced two covers and a centrefold.\n\nWith the recent rise in popularity of boudoir photography, it probably should come as no surprise that more and more women (and men) are not only willing to take off their clothes in front of a camera, but clamouring for it.\n\nCheers to celebrating the human body in all its fine forms.\n\nTo see the rest of the covers, visit Playboy.com.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/images/mobile/view-mobile-icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://i.huffpost.com/gen/5351530/thumbs/o-KIMBERLEY-CONRAD-HEFNER-PLAYBOY-570.jpg?2", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/images/v/print.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://i.huffpost.com/gen/5351502/thumbs/o-RENEE-TENISON-PLAYBOY-570.jpg?3", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://i.huffpost.com/gen/5351492/images/o-CANDACE-COLLINS-PLAYBOY-facebook.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/images/mail_icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://i.huffpost.com/gen/5351500/thumbs/o-LISA-MATTHEWS-PLAYBOY-570.jpg?2", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=canada-style&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://s1.huffpost.com/images/blank.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/06/07/former-playboy-playmates-covers_n_16986346.html", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://s.huffpost.com/images/v/logos/v5/logos-hero-blk-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://i.huffpost.com/gen/5351492/thumbs/o-CANDACE-COLLINS-PLAYBOY-570.jpg?16"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://i.huffpost.com/gen/5351492/images/o-CANDACE-COLLINS-PLAYBOY-facebook.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Zamon"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/06/07/former-playboy-playmates-covers_n_16986346.html", "title": "Former Playboy Cover Models Recreate Their Photos, And It Is Glorious", "meta_data": {"keywords": "former playboy playmates covers,former playmates covers,playboy former playmates,Playboy models,playboy cover stars,playboy magazine,playboy recreate covers,playboy models recreate covers,famous playboy models,kimberly conrad hefner,video", "description": "They look GOOD.", "category": "Canada Style", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostCaStyle", "description": "They look GOOD."}, "fb": {"app_id": 100792273348438}, "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "title": "Playboy Playmates Recreate Their Covers Decades Later, And It Is Glorious", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/06/07/former-playboy-playmates-covers_n_16986346.html", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170611000347im_/http://i.huffpost.com/gen/5351492/images/o-CANDACE-COLLINS-PLAYBOY-facebook.jpg", "description": "They look GOOD.", "locale": "en_CA"}, "sailthru.date": "Wed, 07 Jun 2017 13:11:10 -0400", "sailthru.expire_date": "Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:11:10 -0400", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/5351492/images/s-CANDACE-COLLINS-PLAYBOY-small.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "former playboy playmates covers,former playmates covers,playboy former playmates,Playboy models,playboy cover stars,playboy magazine,playboy recreate covers,playboy models recreate covers,famous playboy models,kimberly conrad hefner,video", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HuffPostCanadaStyle", "section": "Canada Style"}, "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/5351492/images/s-CANDACE-COLLINS-PLAYBOY-small.jpg", "thumbnail": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/5351492/images/o-CANDACE-COLLINS-PLAYBOY-facebook.jpg", "taboola.category": "canada-style"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496782800.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
