He was 61.\n\nPaxton\u2019s family alleges the surgeon used \u201ca high risk and unconventional surgical approach with which he lacked experience\u201d and that the hospital and surgeon, \u201cmisrepresented and/or concealed information relating to the risks of surgery,\u201d according to the suit.\n\nThey believe those factors contributed to Paxton\u2019s post-surgery complications.\n\n\u201cBill Paxton and his family trusted the physicians and staff at this medical facility but instead Cedars-Sinai betrayed their trust,\u201d the family\u2019s attorney Bruce Broillet said in a statement. \u201cThe surgeon\u2019s actions resulted in this tragic and preventable death.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Cedars-Sinai said state and federal privacy laws prohibit it from \u201ccommenting about patient care without written authorization.\u201d But, the statement added, \u201cNothing is more important to Cedars-Sinai than the health and safety of our patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese remain our top priorities,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOne of the reasons for our high quality is that we thoroughly review concerns about any patient\u2019s medical care. This process ensures that we can continue to provide the highest quality care.\u201d\n\nPaxton\u2019s death certificate officially lists his cause of death as stroke after heart surgery.\n\nPaxton was survived by his two children, James and Lydia, and his wife of 30 years, Louise Paxton.\n\nCNN\u2019s Stella Chan contributed to this story.", "images":
