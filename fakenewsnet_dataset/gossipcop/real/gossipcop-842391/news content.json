Stop reading if the episode is still sitting on your DVR.\n\nHomeland ended its fifth season Sunday with the presumed death of Rupert Friend\u2019s Quinn.\n\nHis already-bleak condition took a turn for the worse when the super-sniper suffered a brain hemorrhage. Even if he was to recover, he would\u2019ve been left with severe brain damage, his doc explained to Carrie. That prompted Carrie to remove his pulse monitor before \u2014 presumably \u2014 pulling the plug (or smothering him?) in the episode\u2019s closing minutes. (Or did Quinn stop breathing on his own, as one reader noted in the comments below?) Earlier, Dar handed her the letter Quinn had written her at the end of last season on the off chance he didn\u2019t survive that covert Syrian mission.\n\nHere\u2019s the full text of his heartbreaking farewell note:\n\nCarrie. I guess I\u2019m done. And we never happened. I\u2019m not one for words, but they\u2019re coming now. I don\u2019t believe in fate, or destiny, or horoscopes, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised things turned out this way. I always thought there was something kind of pulling me back to darkness. But I wasn\u2019t allowed a real life. Or a real love. That was for normal people. With you I thought maybe just maybe. But I know now that was a false glimmer. I\u2019m used to\u2026 they happen all of the time in the desert, but this one got to me. And here\u2019s the thing, this death, this end of me is exactly what should\u2019ve happened. I wanted the darkness. I f\u2014ing asked for it. And it has me now. So don\u2019t put a star on the wall for me. Don\u2019t say some dumb speech. Just think of me as a light on the heavens. A beacon. Steering you clear of the wrongs. I loved you. \u2014Yours, for always now, Quinn.\n\n(Quick sidebar: While it\u2019s true we didn\u2019t actually see Carrie pull the plug, given the extent of Quinn\u2019s brain injury, Homeland would risk mass ridicule if it returned in Season 6 with Quinn still alive; he\u2019s dead, people.)\n\nOther highlights from Season 5\u2019s final hour:\n\n* The chemical weapons attack in the Berlin subway station was averted, thanks to Carrie and good samaritan Qasim (may he R.I.P.).\n\n* Saul cut a deal with Ivan \u2014 witness protection in the U.S. in exchange for delivering the duplicitous Allison to him. He came through with his end of the bargain, pinpointing Allison\u2019s whereabouts as she was being smuggled across the border in the trunk of a black sedan. The second the vehicle was in his sights, Saul ordered it fired upon; Allison was killed instantly.\n\nRELATED \u2018Homeland Is Racist\u2019 Message Sneaks Into Season 5 Episode; EP Responds\n\n* Laura and Numan were arrested by the BND for the role they played in stealing those sensitive documents. Astrid then floated a deal by Laura \u2014 publicly throw the late Marwan under the bus and, in return, her hacker buddy Numan won\u2019t be deported. Laura reluctantly accepted it.
