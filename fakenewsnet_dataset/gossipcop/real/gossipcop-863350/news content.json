I took off of work for the past 3 days to surprise my beautiful Oma in Holland on her birthday. She is going through the hardest struggle of her life battling cancer again but I know for a fact she is the strongest woman i have ever met.'\n\nShe added: 'Today is my last day with my family here in Holland and the last thing I want to do is leave...But I will, so I can work my hardest and come back soon.\n\n'Times like these are so important to me and I wouldn't give them up for the world. Happy birthday Oma...Thank you for birthing and raising my perfect mother into the woman she is today,' she concluded.\n\nThe model's post comes days after her little bother, Anwar, celebrated his 18th birthday.\n\nLast week, she shared a photograph of her and her brother when they were younger and captioned the adorable snap: 'Happy birthday my sweet angel. Your love and light is worth all of the stars in the sky! I'm so proud of the man you have become and are becoming. I'm so proud and lucky to call you my brother.\n\n'Nobody loves you more than me my mini me. forever and ever and ever x infinity .. 18 years you're still my best friend and favorite man!' she added.\n\nCould Bella be any cuter right now?\n\nRelated Story Bella Freud\\'s 5 Rules Of Style To Live By\n\nRelated Story The Weeknd Had a Perfect Instagram BF Moment", "images":
