Chaos ensued during the final minutes of the 2017 Oscars on Sunday, February 26, after Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway erroneously presented the Academy Award for Best Picture to La La Land instead of the correct winner, Moonlight. Revisit the snafu in the video above!\n\nThe mishap was by far the most confusing moment of the night and left countless viewers wondering what exactly happened on stage at Hollywood\u2019s Dolby Theatre. Here\u2019s everything we know so far, plus what led to the colossal mix-up.\n\nRelated: Oscars' Most Unforgettable Moments From the historic Oscar speeches of Sally Field and Halle Berry to horrific hosting from Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and James Franco, here are the most unforgettable moments from the Academy Awards.\n\nLa La Land Wins Best Picture\u2026\n\nMoments before Bonnie and Clyde costars Beatty, 79, and Dunaway, 76, walked out on stage, he was given an envelope \u2014 the wrong envelope, it turns out, containing the name of Actress in a Leading Role winner Emma Stone of La La Land. Beatty noticeably paused when he opened the envelope to announce which film won Best Picture, ultimately passing it over to Dunaway, who announced, \u201cLa La Land!\u201d The musical\u2019s cast, director, producers and crew then took the stage to accept the night\u2019s top prize and begin their thank you speeches.\n\n\u2026But Wait, There\u2019s More!\n\nIn one of the most surprising reversals in the history of live television, headset-clad members of the Oscars crew scurried on stage to alert the La La Land team that something was wrong. The film\u2019s producer Jordan Horowitz quickly grabbed the microphone and announced, \u201cThere\u2019s been a mistake. Moonlight, you won best picture. This is not a joke.\u201d Beatty explained to the star-studded audience and viewers at home, \u201cI opened the envelope and it said, \u2018Emma Stone, La La Land.\u2019 That\u2019s why I took such a long look at Faye \u2026 I wasn\u2019t trying to be funny.\u201d\n\nRelated: Oscars 2017 Red Carpet Fashion: What the Stars Wore See Emma Stone, Ruth Negga and all the Oscar nominees and biggest stars on the red carpet at the Academy Awards 2017 on Sunday, February 26, in L.A.!\n\nOscars host Jimmy Kimmel, also on stage, joked about the disastrous incident. \u201cThis is very unfortunate what happened. Personally, I blame Steve Harvey for this,\u201d he quipped, referencing when the Family Feud host flubbed the Miss Universe 2015 winner.\n\nThe Moonlight cast and crew, visibly shocked, then walked on stage to accept the honor in stride, though the all-black cast\u2019s shining moment was, unfortunately, lost amid the confusion of the snafu that nearly broke the internet. \u201cVery clearly, even in my dreams, this could not be true,\u201d the drama\u2019s director, Barry Jenkins, told the crowd. \u201cBut to hell with dreams. I\u2019m done with it \u2019cause this is true. Oh my goodness!\u201d\n\nRelated: Oscars 2017: The Cutest Candid Red Carpet Moments Catch all the candid moments you didn't see on the 2017 Oscars red carpet February 26\n\nOops, Sorry!\n\nPricewaterhouse Coopers, the auditing firm that handles Oscars voting and award envelopes, issued an apology after the mix-up. \u201cWe sincerely apologize to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for best picture,\u201d the company said in a statement on Monday, February 27. \u201cThe presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation.\u201d\n\nSo, What Happened?\n\nThough some details still remain unclear, it appears that the wrong envelope was entirely to blame. According to Pricewaterhouse Coopers, there are two sets of winning envelopes for each category, which explains why Beatty and Stone each had a copy of her best actress card. PwC accountants Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz, the only people in the world who know the Oscar winners prior to the show, told MarketWatch that they stood backstage and handed the envelopes to Beatty and Dunaway right before they walked out.\n\nThank You!

That\u2019s why there\u2019s two of us,\u201d Cullinan told the news outlet. \u201cWe have two briefcases, that are identical, and we have two entire sets of winning envelopes. Martha carries one of those briefcases and I carry the other. We go to the show separately with police escorts.\u201d", "images":
