To prevent dry, chapped, or cracked lips, incorporate the best lip balms for dry lips in your skin care routine. Unlike earlier times, lip balms are no longer thick and waxy. Today\u2019s lip balms are enriched with SPF, natural ingredients, and some even have medicated formulas. There are several different types of lip balms that can prevent dryness throughout the year and make your lips soft and plump.\n\nDr. Enrizza Factor, MD, Philippine Dermatological Society, says, \u201cLip balm or lip salve is a wax-like substance applied topically to the lips to moisturize and relieve chapped or dry lips, angular cheilitis, stomatitis, or cold sores. Lip balms often contain beeswax or carnauba wax, camphor, cetyl alcohol, lanolin, paraffin, and petrolatum, among other ingredients. Some varieties contain dyes, flavors, fragrances, phenol, salicylic acid, and sunscreen.\u201d\n\nIn this article, we have made a list of the 28 best lip balms for dry lips that condition and protect your soft skin from losing moisture. Some of them are tinted and pocket-friendly so that you get a wider range to choose from and use on a regular basis.\n\nWhat Causes Dry Lips?\n\nIf we are playing the blame game, we can credit the cold or dry climate, stress, lifestyle, and dry skin type for pesky lips. However, in fact, unlike other skin parts, lips don\u2019t produce natural oils and have only 3-4 protective layers. Lips also come in contact with saliva, which contains alpha amylase. It is a digestive enzyme that breaks down the skin, making it more sensitive to harsh climates.\n\nOften, some lip balms contain irritants, synthetic fragrances, ample amounts of wax or petrolatum that cause further dryness and irritation. Plus, lifestyle habits like smoking, drinking less water, and exposure to extreme cold weather conditions also contribute to dryness of the lips. However, it takes almost no time or effort, but only a great moisturizing lip balm to prevent dry and chapped and to enjoy juicilicious lips all year round.\n\nAre Lip Balms Good For Dry And Chapped Lips?\n\nLip balms are the go-to saviors to transform your dry and chapped lips into supple and smooth lips. Chapped lips are extra sensitive and needs extra care, especially during cold or dry climate. Lip balms contain emollients that replenish lost moisture and occlusives that prevent moisture loss. Lip balms with beeswax, lanolin, hyaluronic acid, vitamin E seal in moisture, hydrate the lips, and improve their texture. The best lip balms today come with SPF and anti-aging ingredients to protect your lips, preserve their natural youthful, and radiant appearance. Hence, a moisturizing lip balm is a must for dry and chapped lips\n\nBest Lip Balms For Dry Lips\n\n4.7 Image: Burt's Bees\n\nBurt\u2019s Bees lip balms are the classics.

SPF-infused lip balms will protect your lips from harmful UVA/UVB rays, tanning, and pigmentation.\n\nHow To Prevent Dry And Chapped Lips\n\nStay hydrated\n\nStaying hydrated is the primary key to supple, soft lips and skin. Drink 3-4 liters or eight glasses of water every day. A balanced and healthy diet also plays an essential role in maintaining healthy skin. Omega-3 fatty acids are a rich source of hydration.\n\nExfoliate regularly\n\nExfoliation helps eliminate dead skin cells and deep-seated impurities from the skin. It also allows better absorption of lip balms and lip treatments into the skin. Use sugar, a natural humectant, along with honey to make a DIY exfoliant scrub. Exfoliate once or twice weekly to get the best results.\n\nChoose a lip balm with moisturizing ingredients\n\nLook out for a lip balm that contains moisturizing and nourishing ingredients to protect sensitive skin from harsh environmental factors. Shea butter, ceramides, lanolin, and humectants like hyaluronic acid or glycerin are great to keep lips hydrated and supple. Herbal ingredients such as silky coconut, sunflower seed oils, beeswax, and shea butter are also excellent at smoothing and nourishing your puckers. Also, having an SPF in a lip balm is an added and much-needed bonus. Discard lip balms that contain irritants, parabens, menthol, camphor, drying alcohols, artificial fragrances, or colors. They may dry your lips out and cause further damage to already irritated skin on and around the lips.\n\nDon\u2019t pick your lips if they are flaky\n\nLicking or picking flaky or chapped lips makes them even more dehydrated. It can often lead to bleeding and cold sores.\n\nMake DIY masks and scrubs\n\nUse organic oils to create lip masks and kitchen ingredients to moisturize or scrub your lips and boost hydration. Avoid using matte lipstick formulas when you are trying to combat dryness. Instead, pick a tinted lip balm for the added color and moisture, and you\u2019re good to go.\n\nThe Bottom Line Dry lips do not just ruin your makeup look, but they can also be quite painful. You can easily avoid this condition by adding the best lip balms for dry lips to your arsenal. Unlike chemical lip balms, these lip balms are made of organic ingredients like beeswax, vitamin C, and lanolin that help heal bleeding lips and prevent them from flaking and chapping.

Burt\u2019s Bees 100% Natural Moisturizing Lip Balm, Blistex Daily Conditioning Treatment Lip Moisturizer, First Aid Ultra Repair Lip Therapy, Dr. Pawpaw Original Balm, Palmer\u2019s Cocoa Butter Formula Swivel Stick are some of the best lip balms for parched lips.\n\nWhat works best for severely chapped lips?\n\nStarting with the basics, staying well hydrated is essential to combat severely chapped lips. Using an irritant-free, petroleum-free lip balm, enriched with ultra-moisturizing ingredients and SPF works best to treat chapped lips. Using medicated lip balms under a doctor\u2019s discretion would also help with any underlying or surfacing skin conditions. Weekly exfoliation and practicing natural lip remedies with organic oils, aloe vera, and honey will also help improve the condition of severely chapped lips.\n\nHow do you hydrate your lips?\n\nExfoliating weekly, applying a natural or homemade lip mask, followed by a nourishing lip balm, will help hydrate lips. Eating healthy and drinking ample amounts of water also add to the lip hydration.\n\nHow can I fix chapped lips overnight?\n\nExfoliate your lips and apply a thick moisturizing lip balm. Seal it with petroleum jelly as it helps lock in moisture for long. Using a natural DIY lip mask will relieve sores, and improve the appearance of the lips. Follow these steps to get smooth, supple lips overnight.\n\nIs coconut oil good for lips?\n\nCoconut oil is an emollient that has many benefits and is good for your lips. It adds moisture to the lips and absorbs quickly, leaving it supple and glowing. It also has antimicrobial properties that may keep lips germ-free, keeping them protected from infections. However, coconut oil is comedogenic.
