Oddly, Meghan hopped a flight to Los Angeles a day after she made her first public appearance on Harry\u2019s arm since they announced their unlikely engagement.\n\nTongues were wagging in London when Meghan jetted to L.A. to visit her mom, Doria Ragland, for two weeks. Many Brits say it is highly inappropriate for a newly-engaged woman to suddenly abandon her fianc\u00e9 and fly to another continent 5,000 miles away.\n\nBrits say Meghan tricked poor lovestruck Harry into proposing to her by promising she would move to London. She even shipped one of her rescue dogs to London just to show him she was serious.\n\nRelationship experts say women like Meghan, who are products of divorced parents, are damaged goods who show more ambivalence and tend to keep their significant others at arms length.\n\nThe 36-year-old American actress hardly saw Prince Harry in the year that they dated.\n\nShe lived in Toronto and they saw each other a handful of times in between his royal duties in London.\n\nShe also lived apart from her first husband, Trevor Engelson, before dumping him for a celebrity chef in Toronto.\n\nBut Prince Harry isn\u2019t in need of companionship while she\u2019s away. He invited his ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas to a holiday concert at St. Luke\u2019s Church in London on Tuesday.\n\nA source tells E! News that both Harry and Meghan are \u201cbig texters\u201d and that Harry loves to use an emoji or gif. They also FaceTime \u201cevery day when they\u2019re apart\u201d and FaceTime is said to have \u201cplayed a huge role in their relationship.\u201d\n\nThe source says Meghan will fly back to London in time for Christmas \u2014 which is 3 weeks away.\n\nMeghan\u2019s trip triggered intense debate on Sandrarose.com with some readers arguing that she had every right to \u201ctake sone free time\u201d. But others noted that she could have flown her mom to London for a visit.\n\nPhotos by WENN.com, Getty Images", "images": ["https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-1-GettyImages.jpg", "https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/695594-featured-75x75.jpg", "https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/695610-featured-75x75.jpg", "https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/695586-featured-75x75.jpg", "https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/695626-featured-75x75.jpg", "https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sr-logo.jpg", "https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sr-logo-mobile.jpg", "https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/gayle-jayz-interv-300x213.jpg", "https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/695619-featured-75x75.jpg", "https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle-wenn33420311.jpg", "http://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sean-combs-cassie-lawsuit-300x213.jpg", "https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kanyewebian-300x213.jpg", "https://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/michelle-malania-t-300x213.jpg"], "top_img": "http://sandrarose.com/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sandra Rose", "Julia Lyons", "Wutizagranny", "Desiree Edwards", "Malcom Flex", "Davine Puddin"], "canonical_link": "https://sandrarose.com/2017/12/meghan-markle-still-los-angeles-keeps-touch-prince-harry/", "title": "Meghan Markle is STILL in Los Angeles; How She \u2018Keeps in Touch\u2019 with Prince Harry", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Prince Harry's fianc\u00e9e Meghan Markle is still in Los Angeles -- 5,400 miles away from her prince charming.
