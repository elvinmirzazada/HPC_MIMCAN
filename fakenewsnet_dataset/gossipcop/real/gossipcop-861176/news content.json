But that day may come sooner than we think.\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of New York City on Peacock and catch up on the Bravo app.\n\nJill recently posted a lovely message about Bethenny on Instagram, and it seems as though the ice has thawed somewhat between these former friends-turned-foes. \"I\u2019m sitting around going thru photos and put together a collage of @bethennyfrankel with my family,\" Jill wrote in a post that featured photos of Bethenny with her, her late husband Bobby Zarin, her daughter Ally Shapiro, and her mother Gloria Kamen. \"Miss B...thanks for the memories tonight.\"\n\nBethenny attended Bobby's funeral at Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York City on January 15. \"Today is a sad day with a silver lining. I laughed. I cried. I saw old faces & watched a family come together surrounding a loss,\" Bethenny shared on Twitter following the funeral. \"'I have a dream' that Bobby\u2019s death makes us realize what is important & treat each day as our last.\"\n\nRelated\n\nToday is a sad day with a silver lining.

However, Bethenny said she wasn't looking to rekindle her friendship with Jill during the most recent The Real Housewives of New York City reunion.\n\nSee more of Bethenny's thoughts on Jill, below.",
