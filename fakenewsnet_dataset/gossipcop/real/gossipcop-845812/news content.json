And, well, he did some slam poetry about Steve Urkel, who was a character on the 1990s sitcom, \"Family Matters.\"\n\nI've never actually seen an episode of \"Family Matters\" because, well, it went on air years before I was actually born. So, I really didn't understand any of the jokes Kobe was making, or really anything about the poem, to be honest. It was certainly an interesting performance, however, and something I never expected to see from the Mamba.\n\nAnyways, I transcribed it for you all, and am just going to leave it here, because I don't really know what I just watched.\n\nTransformation. Urkel to Urquelle. Suspenders to lapels. From nerdy Steve, got any cheese? So puny and weak, a metamorphasis from geek to fleek. From caterpillar to butterfly. The cocoon, a metal chamber, re-arranger of DNA From nottie, to hottie, differnt person, same body. Using science and playing God, he became an Adonis. A charming disarmer with style and confidence With the pull of a lever, with the wave of a wand, he enters a nerd, but now emerges...Stefan. Ha! He laughs in the face of God. Is it a sin, though, to change who you are? To win the heart of Laura Winslow? Whom he woos, as he coos...'wake me, shake me, bake me, but baby don't forsake me.' But this transmogrification, this Sefan-ification of Steve, is but a reprieve, 'fore the Boss Sauce wears off. Steve. Stefan. Steve. Stefan. Who am I? What have I done? As one man retracts, and fades to black, the other appears in the place he was at. Face in a mask, he doesn't react. Just looks in the mirror, a stranger stares back, and asks, Did I do that?\n\nWell there's that. Hopefully this is funny or interesting to some of you.\n\nI prefer to remember Kobe rhyming in this way.", "images": ["https://sports.cbsimg.net/fly/images/ncaa/logos/team/160870.svg", "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/11/29/17554bc5-79ec-4e64-a073-8c924423e7d7/thumbnail/140x140/d158cb9573a107de84d54f077876e276/untitled-design-2023-11-28t162506-599.png", "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2017/04/25/f5abc457-e485-448c-9e55-9f5af2ffcc47/thumbnail/140x140/6c443ad0c2e8274c168bf6631997b180/kobe1400.jpg", "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/11/29/5d9ec4c5-1c03-414a-aeaf-ccd706c94168/thumbnail/140x140/f0aefa25ff3bde2a1fc4a6819ff85803/mark-cuban-getty.png", "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/11/29/e63a20b9-6318-4bd6-b469-7726686ee012/thumbnail/140x140/d744e1fa59cb0cbb0a6579a1981cde8c/tatum-usatsi.png", "https://sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fly-0591/bundles/sportsmediacss/images/core/logo-paramount-plus-blue.svg", "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/11/29/71d8b8d9-e615-4cce-bc27-4aef0dee80cf/thumbnail/140x140/c70ac8012463f40e39a896ee6e8b6ead/anthony-edwards-getty-1.png", "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/11/29/63770ec4-90c8-416a-867e-3bf59f01ae33/thumbnail/140x140/18e8f4222f2ed7669ce80f2f2cb87a7c/josh-giddey-getty.png", "https://sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fly-0591/bundles/sportsmediacss/images/partners/scout-fantasy.svg", "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/11/29/9928b1d2-db54-4ba6-b74f-3a0dd3b0916b/thumbnail/140x140/118ba22a0d2e15bd3864cf5f17090adc/untitled-design-2023-11-28t234504-263.png", "https://sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fly-0591/bundles/sportsmediacss/images/core/logo-cbs-sports-digital-blue.svg", "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/11/28/171e2971-a893-47ea-86d8-e4e9d3e968d8/thumbnail/140x140/05f3c6b8e3db134fae7e2b1fd13da21e/nbapowerrankings1128.png", "https://sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fly-0591/bundles/sportsmediacss/images/core/commissioner-button2.svg", "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/11/29/6aeb6d92-e9ea-4722-a83e-f3ff2780bcc6/thumbnail/140x140/8c30bcd3a26856534ee7d01708cdc80c/damian-lillard.jpg", "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2017/04/25/f5abc457-e485-448c-9e55-9f5af2ffcc47/thumbnail/1200x675/40ba0e69f48f695c1cb29f7e41e35408/kobe1400.jpg", "https://sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fly-0591/bundles/sportsmediacss/images/core/logo-sportsline-text.svg", "https://sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fly-0591/bundles/sportsmediacss/images/core/commissioner-button1.svg", "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/11/29/8f26b733-c9c3-47c3-9de2-8e9a94e63182/thumbnail/140x140/a9b48c67567b28e9c528a648fd5dfc0e/reiters-block-ist.png", "https://sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fly-0591/bundles/sportsmediacss/images/core/footer_golfweb.svg", "https://sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fly-0591/bundles/sportsmediacss/images/partners/scout-logo.svg", "https://sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fly-0591/bundles/sportsmediacss/images/core/mvp-footer-button.svg", "https://sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fly-0591/bundles/sportsmediacss/images/core/logo-cbs-sports-golazo-network-blue.svg"], "top_img": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2017/04/25/f5abc457-e485-448c-9e55-9f5af2ffcc47/thumbnail/1200x675/40ba0e69f48f695c1cb29f7e41e35408/kobe1400.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jack Maloney", "Min Read", "Bill Reiter", "Jasmyn Wimbish", "Brad Botkin", "Colin Ward-Henninger", "Sam Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/watch-so-uh-kobe-bryant-performed-a-slam-poem-about-steve-urkel/", "title": "WATCH: So, uh, Kobe Bryant performed a slam poem about Steve Urkel?", "meta_data": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Bryant continues his interesting post-retirement appearances", "og": {"site_name": "CBSSports.com", "title": "WATCH: So, uh, Kobe Bryant performed a slam poem about Steve Urkel?", "description": "Bryant continues his interesting post-retirement appearances", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2017/04/25/f5abc457-e485-448c-9e55-9f5af2ffcc47/thumbnail/1200x675/40ba0e69f48f695c1cb29f7e41e35408/kobe1400.jpg", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/watch-so-uh-kobe-bryant-performed-a-slam-poem-about-steve-urkel/"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cbssports"}, "fb": {"pages": 25902406772, "app_id": 297742330311988, "admins": 100002967552623}, "twitter": {"account_id": 14885860, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cbssports", "creator": "@jackmaloneycbs", "title": "WATCH: So, uh, Kobe Bryant performed a slam poem about Steve Urkel? - CBSSports.com", "description": "Bryant continues his interesting post-retirement appearances", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2017/04/25/f5abc457-e485-448c-9e55-9f5af2ffcc47/thumbnail/1200x675/40ba0e69f48f695c1cb29f7e41e35408/kobe1400.jpg"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "CBSSports.com features live scoring and news for NFL football, MLB baseball, NBA basketball, NHL hockey, college basketball and football.
