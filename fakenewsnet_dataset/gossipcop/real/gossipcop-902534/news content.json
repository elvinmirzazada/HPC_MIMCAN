The Oscar-nominated actress has reportedly given birth to her first child (a boy) with her boyfriend, screenwriter Jamie Linden.\n\nThis news might seem totally out of the blue to you, but that's because Rachel, 39, and Jamie, 37, have kept their relationship extremely private. Rachel never even confirmed her pregnancy (which E! News first reported back in February), much less the birth of her child.\n\nBut paparazzi photos captured Rachel and Jamie with a newborn baby, People reported.\n\nBecause they rarely appear in public together, there\u2019s not much out there about the new parents\u2019 relationship. But there are a few things we do know about Jamie Linden:\n\nHe\u2019s a screenwriter, director, and producer.\n\nJamie has written the screenplays for 2006\u2019s We Are Marshall, 2010\u2019s Dear John, 2011\u2019s 10 Years, and 2016\u2019s Money Monster. He also served as co-producer for Dear John and We Are Marshall, and directed the movie 10 Years. He also worked on the screenplay for the upcoming sci-fi movie Chaos Walking, an adaptation of the young adult novel by Patrick Ness, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nHis directorial debut was based on his high school reunion.\n\n10 Years, which he both wrote and directed, was set at his alma mater, Lake Howell High School in Florida, though it was not actually filmed there. The movie, which tells the story of a 10-year high school reunion, was inspired by his own reunion, which he went to alongside his old classmate, actor Scott Porter, who also starred in Dear John. \"Scott and I had come back from our 10-year reunion,\" Linden told the Orlando Sentinelin 2012. \u201c[Costar Channing Tatum] didn't go to his reunion in Tampa. We were explaining the shenanigans we got into. The reunion was back in '07. We started messing around with this in '08. It took a couple of years to do it.\"\n\nHe got his start working with legends.\n\nHe told Variety in 2012 that his first job was as an assistant to the directors Sidney Pollack and Anthony Minghella. \u201cI remember the first time I ever spoke to Sidney, he was getting ready to do The Interpreter and he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m doing this. Every time I start to make a movie I can\u2019t remember why I\u2019m doing this,\u2019 and I never really understood that until I wrapped [10 Years],\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge amount of time and effort and you have to really, really love it.\u201d\n\nRelated Story The Love Story Of Carrie Underwood And Her Husband\n\nHe once won $5,000 on The Price Is Right.\n\nIn an interview with a Florida State University alumni publication, Jamie revealed that when he was in the audience of The Price Is Right as a recent graduate, he got picked to compete. And he actually won\u2014bringing home $5,000 and a Tuscan wine server cart. \u201cThe money actually helped me stay in California longer than I had planned,\u201d he said, which led to him getting more experience in the industry.\n\nHe used to date Zooey Deschanel.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAccording to People, Jamie and Zooey dated from 2014 to 2016. The two were regulars on the red-carpet circuit during that time.\n\nHe has kept his relationship with Rachel intensely private.\n\nJamie and Rachel have not appeared as a couple on a red carpet or in any official capacity. One of the few photos that exists of the two together is from 2016, when they went to a wedding together in Virginia, E! News notes. They have been spotted by paparazzi only a few times, in Los Angeles and Paris.\n\nCongratulations, Rachel and Jamie!", "images":
