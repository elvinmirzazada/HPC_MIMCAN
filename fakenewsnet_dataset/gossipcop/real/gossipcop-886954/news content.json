Jessica Alba was one of those aspiring actors \u2014 and she managed to get a two-episode arc on the cult-favorite series. However, while it was probably a dream come true for an actor looking to make it big, Alba said that she wasn't allowed to look at any of the cast members in the eyes, which made it hard to do her job, which was to act alongside them.\n\nEmma McIntyre / Staff\n\n\"On the set of 90210, I couldn\u2019t even make eye contact with any of the cast members, which was really strange when you\u2019re like trying to do a scene with them,\" Alba said of her time on the show. She revealed the news to Sean Evans during an appearance on the YouTube series, Hot Ones.\n\n\"It was like, 'You're not allowed to make eye contact with any one of the cast members or you\u2019ll be thrown off the set,'\" she explained. She didn't mention who gave her those specific instructions, however.\n\nAlba appeared on two episodes of season 8 and played a pregnant teenager who came into a clinic where Kelly Taylor, played by Jennie Garth, worked. Rules or not, Alba managed to get through the scene without getting thrown off the set.\n\nAlba is just one of many, many celebs who appeared on the show. Aside from the regular cast, a host of now-recognizable names appeared for bit parts. Hilary Swank, Vivica A. Fox, and Eva Longoria all featured in 90210, too.", "images":
