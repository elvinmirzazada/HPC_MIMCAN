Additionally, the Twitter account that originally posted the clip has been removed.\n\nOn Monday, Mosley took to Instagram to share a statement condemning the prevalence of sex tape leaks and the culture that he feels excuses it.\n\n\"We have to change this culture of abuse and assault against women. Today\u2019s post saddens me deeply as it is an attack not only against my client but my friend,\" Mosley wrote. \"Why do we think it\u2019s acceptable to sell, or publish, or seek revenge, or blackmail women in this way and without their consent? It\u2019s not.\"\n\nThe high-profile attorney then implored men to \"do better.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m tired of telling my clients to not make videos because the men will put them out later. It\u2019s like I\u2019m telling them not to wear short skirts because you\u2019re going to entice a man to rape you,\" he continued. \"And like most rapes, these betrayals often come from those most close to us. So today I\u2019m saying, men we need to do better. We need to tell each other to do better. We need to stop sharing these videos with each other in the club, at the barbershop or (and especially) online.\"\n\nMosely concluded by calling it a \"morally corrupt action,\" one that is criminal in the state of California.\n\n\"Maybe it is time to set an example,\" he wrote.\n\nAttorney Lisa Bloom, who represented Chyna during her lawsuit against her ex-fiance, Rob Kardashian, last year, took to Twitter to explain the dangers of illegally posting sex tapes.\n\n\"Revenge porn -- posting explicit images without the consent of everyone in those images -- is a crime, a civil wrong, and a form of domestic abuse,\" Bloom wrote, without referring to Chyna by name in her posts. \"It's also a way to try to slut shame women for being sexual. Girls have killed themselves over revenge porn. It's not a joke.\"\n\nBloom also responded to a critic who dismissed the outrage because, they claimed, Chyna \"knew [the man] was recording.\"\n\n\"Whether a woman knows she's being recorded is not the issue. Whether she consented to posting is,\" Bloom tweeted. \"Our bodies, our choice, each and every time.\"\n\nET has reached out to Chyna's attorney for comment.\n\nCurrently, Chyna is involved in a lawsuit against several members of the Kardashian family -- including her ex, Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner.
