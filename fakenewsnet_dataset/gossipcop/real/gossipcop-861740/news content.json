Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s dad, Mathew Knowles, confirmed that the singer welcomed twins with her husband, Jay Z.\n\nRelated: Beyonce and Jay-Z\u2019s Sexy Romance Beyonce and Jay-Z tied the knot in 2008 and are parents of three \u2014 look back at their cutest moments together!\n\nThe businessman, 65, celebrated the babies\u2019 arrival by posting a balloon-covered birthday card to Instagram on Sunday, June 18. \u201cHappy Birthday to the twins! Love, Granddad,\u201d the card read. Knowles captioned the post, \u201cThey\u2019re here! #beyonce #jayz #twins #birthday #happy birthday.\u201d (Knowles is already grandpa to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 5-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, and Solange Knowles\u2019 12-year-old son, Julez.)\n\nKnowles\u2019 confirmation, however, angered some of the BeyHive, who thought that the \u201cFormation\u201d singer, 35, should have been the one to announced the twins\u2019 arrival. \u201cBeyonce\u2019s dad had no business telling Beyonce\u2019s announcement. Exactly why he didn\u2019t know she was pregnant until the Instagram post. I can\u2019t,\u201d one tweeter wrote.\n\nThey\u2019re here! .\u2800 .\u2800 .\u2800 #beyonce #jayz #twins #birthday #happybirthday A post shared by Mathew Knowles (@mrmathewknowles) on Jun 18, 2017 at 7:12am PDT\n\nRelated: See Every Time Beyonce Slayed Her Twin Pregnancy Style Ever since Beyonce announced her second pregnancy, she has slayed the maternity fashion game \u2014 watch the singer's twin pregnancy style lookbook\n\n\u201cI really hope you had Beyonce\u2019s permission to announce this because otherwise you are so far out of line,\u201d an Instagram commenter wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s Beyonce\u2019s news and if she felt ready to announce the birth she would have done it by now.\u201d\n\nOthers defended Knowles\u2019 post, though. \u201cIt\u2019s completely alright if the grandfather wants to announce it,\u201d one Instagram commenter wrote. Another Instagram user pointed out, \u201cIt could be the grandparents or the mother or the father. There\u2019s no tradition.\u201d\n\nRelated: Beyonce\u2019s Best Instagram Style There's never a moment when Queen Bey doesn't look flawless\u2014and that's especially true on her Instagram account!
