Take a look back at Us Weekly's The Bachelor and Bachelorette covers, including stars like Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudice, Ben Flajnik and Courtney Robertson, and more\n\n\u201cThe reason that Robert and I aren\u2019t together is because I felt like I was really busy with work and traveling a lot so it wasn\u2019t a sense of like, \u2018Oh, I want to be free and date as many guys as possible.\u2019 It was more of me just wanting to take this time for myself and focus on me and what I\u2019m doing,\u201d the Bachelor alum exclusively told Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cIt just ended. It wasn\u2019t like one of us cheated or there was this bitterness,\u201d she explained. \u201cI still care a lot about him and there\u2019s no hard feelings. Hopefully on either side, but I can say that for me.\u201d\n\nUs broke the news in May that Tilley and the fellow Bachelor Nation star broke up after a couple of months of dating. Tilley revealed that she\u2019s now \u201cextremely single\u201d and that \u201cthe dating world terrifies\u201d her.\n\nRelated: The Bachelor Season 20: Meet Ben Higgins\u2019 Bachelorettes!

The Bachelorette alum starred on Rachel Lindsay\u2019s season and recently got caught in a love triangle during season 4 of Bachelor in Paradise.\n\n\u201cI post photos on social media with guys like Dean and people very quickly assume that we\u2019re dating,\u201d Tilley told Us. \u201cIt\u2019s just very funny how social media can quickly escalate based on photos.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Splits of 2017 From Kylie Jenner and Tyga to Janet Jackson and Wissam Al Mana, take a look back at the biggest and most shocking celebrity splits of 2017 \u2014 see the photos\n\nTilley has previously dated Bachelor alums Ben Higgins and Chris Soules \u2014 and she\u2019s still friends with them.\n\n\u201cBen\u2019s honestly one of my favorite people,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m friends with Chris Soules. I just have really accepted that even though things don\u2019t work out romantically, if I find myself being able to have a connection with them even in a friendship way, if they\u2019re good people then I\u2019m happy to have them in my life.\u201d\n\nThank You!

I think that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d she told Us. \u201cI would love to see Ben as the Bachelor again, but I think he\u2019s like someone who takes it very serious and he wants to go on it when his heart\u2019s ready.
