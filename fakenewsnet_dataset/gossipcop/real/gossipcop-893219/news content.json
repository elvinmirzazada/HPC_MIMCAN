None of the three have posted any acknowledgement or response to the songs about them. (In fact, back when first Kimye response song \"Look What You Made Me Do\" came out, TMZ went so far as to report via sources that Swift's feud with Kardashian and West isn't even on the couple's radar; they care that little.)\n\nBut Kardashian did post clear proof that she and her daughter North West were living their best lives last night, coincidentally at Perry's Los Angeles Witness tour concert. She shared multiple Instagram stories of herself singing along to \"E.T.\", the Perry song that West collaborated on:\n\nShe and her daughter North even hung with Perry during the show. Kardashian posted a kissy-face receipt:\n\nInstagram\n\nWhat Perry and Kardashian talked about only they will ever know, but the timing is statement-making\u2014and deliberately so, it'd seem. Perry played the Staples Center in LA for three nights in a row, but Kardashian chose Reputation Friday\u2014and Perry's last show\u2014to go.
