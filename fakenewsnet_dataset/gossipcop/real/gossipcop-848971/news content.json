It is not clear if he has retained an attorney.\n\nThe youngest brother of Paris, Nicky and Barron Hilton, Conrad had allegedly tried to break into the home of voice actress E.G. Daily, TMZ reports \u2014 violating a 2015 restraining order E.G.\u2019s daughter, Hunter Daily Saloman, had against him.\n\nHunter and Conrad had dated previously, but split in 2015. He was arrested in June 2015 for violating the restraining order, after police found him inside Daily\u2019s home.\n\nA radio call came into police at 4:50 a.m. on Saturday, Houser said.\n\nPrior to that, Conrad had allegedly gone to the home of Rick Salomon \u2014 Hunter\u2019s father and E.G.\u2019s ex-husband, TMZ reports. There, he allegedly stole Rick\u2019s Bentley.\n\nAs fans of the Hilton family may remember, Rick had starred with Paris\u2019 in her infamous 2004 sex tape.\n\nConrad last made headlines in Aug. 2016, when he was released from prison after serving two months for violating his parole.\n\nHe has been on parole since 2015, and previously admitted in court on June 6 to violating the terms of his parole by using drugs \u2014 including marijuana, synthetic cannabinoids and cocaine.\n\nIn March 2015, Conrad plead guilty to assault for making threats against both passengers and flight attendants on an international flight from London to Los Angeles in July 2014. According to a criminal report obtained by PEOPLE, witnesses reported that he shouted profanities at crew and passengers, including, \u201cI am going to f\u2014\u2014 kill you!\u201d\n\nThe son of Kathy and Rick Hilton was ordered into a substance abuse treatment center in January 2016 for at least 90 days after allegedly failing drug tests and violating his parole.\n\nIn 2008, Conrad was arrested for a DUI after another driver observed his black Mercedes driving erratically on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. Just 18 at the time, he was sentenced by a Malibu court to three years probation and two alcohol education classes \u2014 while his license was suspended for a year.", "images":
