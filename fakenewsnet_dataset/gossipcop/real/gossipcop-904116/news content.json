So how do you top that in season two? If Donald Glover has anything to say about it: Tiny Toon Adventures. Seriously.\n\nThe Emmy-winning co-creator and star revealed that he was largely inspired by the 1992 direct-to-video animated film, Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation, which followed the younger versions of the iconic Looney Tunes characters during their summer vacation from school. It later aired on TV as four separate episodes.\n\n\u201cIn the writers\u2019 room, we talked about [How I Spent My Vacation] by Tiny Toons. That was the inspiration for season two,\u201d Donald revealed at FX\u2019s Television Critics Association press tour on Friday to laughter, adding at one point that it was one of his favorite childhood TV shows.\n\nAdded executive producer and writer Stephen Glover: \u201cWe kind of took that idea of a whole story, but being told in a bunch of different parts that could maybe seem like they\u2019re their own thing but they all are one.\u201d \u201cYou enjoy them more when they're together, but you can also enjoy them in bits,\u201d Donald said.\n\nThe Atlanta team insisted that they didn\u2019t rely on what worked successfully in season one in planning out the upcoming episodes, which they're calling Atlanta Robbin' Season.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really look back at season one for inspiration as much. I feel like if you do that as a producer of television, you tend to be risk averse, which I think is bad for art,\u201d Donald said. \u201cWhat are the things that will make people happy? We just tried to be ourselves.\u201d\n\nProducer and director Hiro Murai pointed to the season\u2019s unique title as a palette cleanser of sorts. \u201cThe title is setting up the audience to approach the show differently,\u201d he said, adding that season two is much more \u201ccohesive.\u201d \u201cSeason two, we have a general idea of how we wanted the season to feel like. We picked a lane a little bit more.\u201d\n\nSo what is \u201crobbin\u2019 season\u201d actually referring to?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a time in Atlanta, before Christmastime and New Year\u2019s. Basically a bunch of crime happens in the city during that time,\u201d Stephen said. \u201cPeople have to give Christmas gifts and people add stuff and you need money, so it\u2019s a time when robbery goes up. You might get your package stolen from your door. When we were there shooting the season, my neighbor got her car stolen. It\u2019s an intense and desperate time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make that the backdrop to the season and our characters are going through that same desperate time of transition from their old lives to where they\u2019re headed now,\u201d he continued. \u201cRobbin\u2019 Season is a metaphor.\u201d\n\nAtlanta returns Thursday, March 1 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on FX.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2F1280_donald_glover_gettyimages-848643742.jpg%3Fh%3Dc0a2dff4&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fdonaldglover_1280.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2F1280_donald_glover_emmys_gettyimages-848675388.jpg%3Fh%3D21445cab&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/donald_glover_getty_901646650.jpg?h=c673cd1c"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/donald_glover_getty_901646650.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/donald-glover-reveals-atlantas-surprising-season-2-inspiration-93621", "title": "Donald Glover Reveals 'Atlanta's' Surprising Season 2 Inspiration", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/donald_glover_getty_901646650.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 34-year-old creator and star explains why he didn't rely on the successes of season one in the upcoming 11-episode season.", "title": "Donald Glover Reveals 'Atlanta's' Surprising Season 2 Inspiration", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/donald-glover-reveals-atlantas-surprising-season-2-inspiration-93621", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 34-year-old creator and star explains why he didn't rely on the successes of season one in the upcoming 11-episode season.", "twitter": {"description": "The 34-year-old creator and star explains why he didn't rely on the successes of season one in the upcoming 11-episode season.", "title": "Donald Glover Reveals 'Atlanta's' Surprising Season 2 Inspiration", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/donald-glover-reveals-atlantas-surprising-season-2-inspiration-93621", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/donald_glover_getty_901646650.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Donald Glover Reveals 'Atlanta's' Surprising Season 2 Inspiration | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, Donald Glover, Atlanta", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
