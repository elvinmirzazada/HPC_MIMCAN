At one point, Liam was rubbing Miley\u2019s back. They looked very happy and affectionate.\u201d\n\nAdds another source: \u201cHe was really protective of her. He would just pull her close to him and put his arm around her.\u201d\n\nBefore the festival, Cyrus also stopped by fashion store Spell to pick out a few items.\n\n\u201cElsa [Pataky] organized a private session after hours for Miley and a few friends to come and shop,\u201d says Mel Carrero, a publicist for Spell. \u201cShe saw a few of Elsa\u2019s pieces and so she wanted to check it out. She was pretty down-to-earth, funny. It was fun.\u201d\n\nAfter splitting two years ago, \u201cMiley never got over Liam,\u201d a source close to the singer tells PEOPLE. \u201cDespite them constantly fighting before the split, Miley always said Liam is the love of her life.\u201d", "images":
