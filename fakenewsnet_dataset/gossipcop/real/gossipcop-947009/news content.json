While the two are good pals, they never miss an opportunity to poke a little fun at each other or embarrass each other should the moment arise.\n\nTheir latest online exchange? KJ recently posted a meme of himself and Cole side-by-side when they were actually teens \u2014 you know, the ages Archie Andrews and Jughead Jones are supposed to be? (KJ is 21 and Cole is 25.) To accompany the pic, KJ wrote, \u201cMan, I would have absolutely crushed you at age 17. Crushed.\u201d He also added, \"And I still would now.\"\n\nWhile teen KJ does have some serious biceps and teen Cole looks a bit more like he did in his Suite Life days, that didn\u2019t mean Cole was ready to accept defeat. He hopped on to comment on the pic, writing, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even have survived the weight of my wallet b*tch.\u201d (Likely a reference to those Disney paychecks and a net worth built from years of being a child actor on TV and in movies like Big Daddy.)", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6565f8459ffee5d104c24ca8/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/655b6a9b598916c05e9e2c7e/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/65553f2f4054df0a9723d43c/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b30ee7ee01ec56ccd39b253/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/65666eae306d11a99a1f5bbb/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b30ee78936c7e5d44e21178/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/lede.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/65568ecdff1de3cb5a62dfaa/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/65527fac299e8b66501def86/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/655e44a7d2be238411f8e037/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b30ee7ee01ec56ccd39b253/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Kara K.
