Let's start with a pair,\" she sings.\n\nShe calls him a \"beautiful thing\" and notes how much she likes his mouth and beard, before concluding the song by crooning, \"He's for me or no one else.\"\n\nIllustrations of Gerard, 30, and Shakira also appear alongside the words in the official lyric video.\n\nThe Colombian star publicised the song by sending postcards to her fans with the name of the track and an image of her hugging a tree. In the card, she wrote, \"Very happy to share with all of you my new single 'Me enamore.' This song narrates a moment in my life when I was so in love that I was literally climbing trees.\"\n\nThe track is the second single from her upcoming album, her follow-up to 2014 record Shakira.\n\n\u00a9 Cover Media", "images": ["https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9085/7ca224b17974478887cd5fe333a5d066.svg", "https://www.news24.com/images/components/shared/applestorelink.svg?v=om_Fs4OAJyyS6QGaLri0VUKmaBSz4rIDdy24kEufuZ8", "https://www.news24.com/images/icons/share/black/twitter.svg?v=prXwZoSJVyx1LClyL8ZXUf1lgODsYJVGZILWNYSkIp8", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10123/17ee868c934d4b19970aaebb0de368a9.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10123/8b2f842d04294a049ff631b7c5ee8d6d.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/425/22d06c7131a941a59caadcce02afffcd.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3975/69cae3a77097454bb92054613db98ee3.svg", "https://e-editions.news24.com/get_image.aspx?eid=44bb9007-4316-427e-8ca5-2448795d2245&w=400", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3975/02d6acae35d24dbb89aab5d2868322d4.svg", "https://www.news24.com/images/icons/share/Facebook.svg?v=Rby37QLdINwmv3cr5YM4rOUVo5QZeJmS6xPGrFIbcXw", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10123/3fcd4702860649d2b4830370660214b3.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10123/bfc3ee36bf564b8f86832d6dee577335.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10123/9b17bf3ed27f47ec8c4f9c02fe7b7568.jpg", "https://www.news24.com/images/icons/share/Twitter.svg?v=prXwZoSJVyx1LClyL8ZXUf1lgODsYJVGZILWNYSkIp8", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/448/dc1369c1a81941308f12ba6933e64d71.jpg", "https://www.news24.com/images/tenants/you/Logo.svg?v=_R-3eWRyz2Q6oNyTpED2lzfS3sslIFe1quGAL45aBE4", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9542/2daa6f2837dd4b1bba577d753b053c1e.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/cms/general/d/5192/a61675c8de004b1283526da936749ee0.png", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10123/679554d72b2940e09a1c558c1c879221.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10123/c90147773fc54ccfbcbed887b3615af8.jpg", "https://www.news24.com/images/components/shared/iab.png?v=9mKMSyDoe4bgfovLnNfxIoO5maeKlmVbfWZ8QLjxHGM", "https://www.news24.com/images/icons/share/Email.svg?v=bOZR6JyxLFu7Nlzxh9y0sn_I6ON3olS8DexzVOnJYOc", "https://www.news24.com/images/icons/share/black/instagram.svg?v=g1aktfWy20egFc1BN8jiWsPHC2V3Te_YBzPmnMMHLhI", "https://www.news24.com/images/icons/comment_icon.svg?v=ZZPTe0-QKnE7Yb3zpCM0hsVC7ZRqwQ4F60OnIMI74ME", "https://www.news24.com/images/components/shared/huaweigallerylink.svg?v=H2XY1Qzwrd89iIowrDA-4ie0FL8d5MJd0G-5wUTfLyM", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3975/c3de66e747f94c45a15f846e3c1f1650.svg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10123/b14ca13437994ae8b8da0dc83028b9b6.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3975/5e83121c33694777a8e73e6e4384bd09.svg", "https://www.news24.com/images/components/shared/bookmark.svg?v=Nr24ylm879zzJd74dUSjSdc6tkeYsu1U4hsxDhYlBJc", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10123/a94200cb01404327a7b0d0f0241e5396.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10123/1bc90085232e4f409298f8de5b27ab2d.jpg", "https://www.news24.com/images/icons/share/black/facebook.svg?v=Rby37QLdINwmv3cr5YM4rOUVo5QZeJmS6xPGrFIbcXw", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7158/8a0e59b57d0e4becb0318488add09e58.svg", "https://www.news24.com/images/components/shared/googleplaylink.svg?v=WnEq_LCwDqHAhUhB-yirJO-bQuj5ye8O6vWaoDc48zw", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10123/ae7bd7bf951249a785b86a591e34e86e.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10123/2cdd996acb484fdf857d6528c856c7e2.jpg", "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5888/5e53e377d4c1423cb9fd36ba7c1da527.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5888/5e53e377d4c1423cb9fd36ba7c1da527.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.news24.com/you/archive/shakira-recalls-first-time-she-met-gerard-pique-in-new-song-20170728", "title": "Shakira recalls first time she met Gerard Pique in new song", "meta_data": {"mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "News24", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "default", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "red", "msapplication-TileColor": "red", "msapplication-TileImage": "~/images/pwa/news24/mstile-150x150.png", "application-name": "News24", "msapplication-tooltip": "News24.
