It\u2019s where Brittany, a Kentucky native, says she\u2019s always wanted to get married.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually, knock on wood, it\u2019s running smoother than expected,\u201d Jax shares of wedding planning. It\u2019s also, seemingly, been easier than expected. Brittany confesses to finding her dream wedding dress on the first day she went out shopping!\n\n\u201cI did not mean to, but the very first place I went to I actually found a dress,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI'm not gonna just announce the designer and stuff just yet because I don't want [Jax] to know anything about it. Whenever I walk down the aisle, that's gonna be the first time he sees it or knows anything about what it looks like.\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old says fans will get to see part of her wedding dress experience on season seven of VPR, but she made sure cameras were off when she said yes to the dress. The pair has also put asks out to their bridal party -- expect lots of Vanderpump co-stars flanking the couple at the altar -- and is finalizing their guest list.\n\n\u201cI think our cap is gonna be around 200, 220 [guests], something like that,\u201d Brittany shares.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a destination wedding, so we\u2019re gonna have some people who won\u2019t be able to make it,\u201d Jax adds. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve got some people that have never been to Kentucky before that are coming.\u201d\n\nOne person they know for sure won\u2019t snag an invite is James Kennedy, who burnt any bridge he had with the couple after \u201cfreestyling\u201d a rap about Jax cheating on Brittany.\n\n\u201dThey made it look like it was just a one-time thing, where he said a line in a 'freestyle,\u2019\u201d Brittany recalls. \u201cIt was a much bigger deal, and we all know it\u2019s not a freestyle. James does not freestyle. I\u2019m sure he can\u2019t actually freestyle.\u201d\n\nAll that\u2019s left to do for the couple is nail down their menu, cake and an officiant. While co-stars Katie Maloney and Tom Schwartz asked Lisa Vanderpump to conduct their 2016 wedding ceremony, Jax and Brittany plan to let Lisa just sit back and enjoy their day.\n\n\u201cWe love Lisa, so it\u2019s not like we would be like, \u2018No, wouldn\u2019t want that!\u2019\u201d Brittany explains. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to my family that we have somebody from the church.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to me, too,\u201d Jax chimes in. \u201cI thought what [Tom and Katie] did with Lisa was really cool and very awesome, for them \u2026 I thought what they did was really amazing. I think it just worked. You know, Brittany is a Christian girl, and I literally just started going to church again this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna ask somebody that I went to church with when I was a little girl,\u201d Brittany says of picking their officiant. \u201cHe\u2019s known me my whole life, and he\u2019s a great speaker. Just so down to earth, so cool.\u201d\n\nFor more Jax and Brittany, tune into Vanderpump Rules every Monday at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-11%2F1280_getty_stassi_beau_3.jpg%3Fh%3De1ae12ef&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-11%2Fvanderpump_vidpic.jpg%3Fh%3D0c2a3428&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-12/eto_jaxbrittwedding_120318vp.png?h=a20a8a77", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-12%2Fintv_jax_brittany_120218_vidpic.jpg%3Fh%3D3b44b168&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-12/eto_jaxbrittwedding_120318vp.png?h=a20a8a77", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/why-lisa-vanderpump-wont-officiate-jax-taylor-and-brittany-cartwrights-wedding-exclusive-115016", "title": "Why Lisa Vanderpump Won\u2019t Officiate Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright\u2019s Wedding (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-12/eto_jaxbrittwedding_120318vp.png?h=a20a8a77", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The \u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 stars explain to ET why they want their boss to be a guest at their big day, but not a part of the ceremony.", "title": "Why Lisa Vanderpump Won\u2019t Officiate Jax and Brittany's Wedding", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/why-lisa-vanderpump-wont-officiate-jax-taylor-and-brittany-cartwrights-wedding-exclusive-115016", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The \u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 stars explain to ET why they want their boss to be a guest at their big day, but not a part of the ceremony.", "twitter": {"description": "The \u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 stars explain to ET why they want their boss to be a guest at their big day, but not a part of the ceremony.", "title": "Why Lisa Vanderpump Won\u2019t Officiate Jax and Brittany's Wedding", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/why-lisa-vanderpump-wont-officiate-jax-taylor-and-brittany-cartwrights-wedding-exclusive-115016", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-12/eto_jaxbrittwedding_120318vp.png?h=a20a8a77", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Why Lisa Vanderpump Won\u2019t Officiate Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright\u2019s Wedding (Exclusive) | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Vanderpump Rules, Lisa Vanderpump, Jax Taylor, Brittany Cartwright", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
