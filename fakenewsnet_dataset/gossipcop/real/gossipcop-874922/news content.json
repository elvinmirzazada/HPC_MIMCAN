He's showing me a symbol of death threat and then not taking death threat seriously, which would indicate if we don't know who did it, many people would.\"\n\nBiggie, via Henry, kept the identities of those two people a mystery though. Lil' Kim, however, had an idea of what the psychic was talking about.\n\n\"He was definitely at a party before it happened,\" she said. \"I will say this, it was a little after 2Pac passed away. I remember he called us all in the room and he had a meeting with us. He was like, we have to stay tight. It's almost like he felt something but no one else picked up on it. I took it very seriously.\"\n\nIn an interview with ET, Henry explained that Biggie was more interested in relaying \"some of the things he didn't get to say to [Kim] that he needed to get off his chest\" than his murder. \"When it came to his actual passing, there was not that much in that department,\" he explained. \"It's always interesting to see what they prioritize in bringing through. You would think sometimes people would come through and bring up their death as the first thing and sometimes those are the people who don't.\"\n\nDuring the reading, he relayed that the late rapper considered Lil' Kim his \"soulmate,\" adding, \"For him, loving you was the greatest accomplishment his soul truly feels it was ever able to do. You showed him what love was but you helped teach him in ways that no one else did and that's so special.\"", "images":
