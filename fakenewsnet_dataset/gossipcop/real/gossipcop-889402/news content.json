She hasn't left a void. She's left a blast crater\u2026 Five days after Michelle was gone, Alice and I were half-awake at dawn, after a night of half-sleeping. Alice sat up in bed. Her face was silhouetted in the dawn light of the bedroom windows. I couldn\u2019t see her expression. I just heard her voice: 'When your mum dies you're the best memory of her. Everything you do and say is a memory of her.' That's the kind of person Michelle created and helped shape.\"", "images": ["https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/92e4a5aac89a-gettyimages-1179309601.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/845368d87d62-patton-oswalt-wife-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0a625ae90a2a-emmy-griffiths-hello-magazine.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3f2f39507707-patton-oswalt-wife-a.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ca4b7e3db572-dawn-french-and-lenny-henry-wedding-day.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0fde109827bf-jay-blades-wedding-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/715331d33f97-gma-weddings.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f43b775e7240-gettyimages-1385052866.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/845368d87d62-patton-oswalt-wife-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f354465f948c-jodie-whittaker-and-christian.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1c0ee9acecd5-jamie-wedding-z.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/74bbb6a520d6-david-mills-and-judi-dench.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/845368d87d62-patton-oswalt-wife-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emmy Griffiths", "Tv", "Film Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/brides/2017110643748/patton-oswalt-remarries-meredith-salenger/", "title": "Patton Oswalt remarries 18 months after first wife's sudden death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "title": "Patton Oswalt remarries 18 months after death of wife | HELLO!", "description": "Patton Oswalt has tied the knot with his partner Meredith Salenger!
