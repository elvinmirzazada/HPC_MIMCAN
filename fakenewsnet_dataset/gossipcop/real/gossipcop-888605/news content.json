So the cops came in the middle of the night, knocking on my manager and on my door, talking about that we were smoking weed and we gotta get kicked out,\u201d the former Love & Hip Hop star said in an Instagram video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNow, if you know me, I don\u2019t even talk about smoking weed because everybody knows that I do not smoke weed. I get very paranoid and none of my team members smoke weed. If they was to kick us out for something else, all right, but for weed? I\u2019m not taking that because we do not smoke. I could get, we could all get drug-tested, nobody smokes. Nobody smokes, especially when I\u2019m sleeping and I\u2019m wild sick,\u201d she added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Cardi was escorted out of the hotel by a police officer, she knocked over an object and shouted, \u201cRacist motherfuckers!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her now-deleted Instagram video, she called out the city and cops for being racist.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd then niggas is just gonna pick out of everybody on the floor, Caucasians, that it was us that was smoking the weed in the middle of the night?\u201d she said. \u201cThat shit is not fucking right. Like, niggas was really being racists. Motherfuckers was being prejudiced and picking on who the fuck they thought that was smoking weed, and you got the wrong fucking one. I\u2019m telling you, I do not smoke weed.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.theroot.com/cardi-b-kicked-out-of-hotel-over-weed-claims-cop-was-r-1819764708", "title": "Cardi B, Kicked Out of Hotel Over Weed, Claims Cops Were Racist", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "QDPLbDJXTQNT0n69mvNADCeRmwnbkYyL20OKJAVCKq8", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Cardi B and her crew were in Albany, N.Y., over the weekend, and she says that the Hilton Albany Hotel where they were staying kicked them out over accusations of marijuana smoke.", "og": {"title": "Cardi B, Kicked Out of Hotel Over Weed, Claims Cops Were Racist", "description": "Cardi B and her crew were in Albany, N.Y., over the weekend, and she says that the Hilton Albany Hotel where they were staying kicked them out over accusations of marijuana smoke.", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "url": "https://www.theroot.com/cardi-b-kicked-out-of-hotel-over-weed-claims-cop-was-r-1819764708", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Root", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_80,q_80,w_80/f5zr3vuc90hrpnmx0nme.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,q_80,w_200/f5zr3vuc90hrpnmx0nme.png", "keywords": "cardi b, albany, racism, hilton albany, The Root", "news_keywords": "cardi b, albany, racism, hilton albany, The Root", "fb": {"app_id": 216290255435043, "pages": 26423400230}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.theroot.com/cardi-b-kicked-out-of-hotel-over-weed-claims-cop-was-r-1819764708", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TheRoot", "title": "Cardi B, Kicked Out of Hotel Over Weed, Claims Cops Were Racist", "description": "Cardi B and her crew were in Albany, N.Y., over the weekend, and she says that the Hilton Albany Hotel where they were staying kicked them out over accusations of marijuana smoke.", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-23T12:53:00.708Z"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508763180.708, "source": "https://thegrapevine.theroot.com", "summary": ""}
