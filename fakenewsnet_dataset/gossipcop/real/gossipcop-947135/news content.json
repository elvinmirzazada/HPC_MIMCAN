And I commit myself to doing this.\"\n\nAfter a brief opening greeting in Hebrew, William added: \"Israel's remarkable story is partly one of remembering its terrible past but also looking forward to a much more hopeful future ... the modern story is one of inventing, creating, innovating and striding confidently into its future.\"\n\nEarlier in Jerusalem, he met Netanyahu and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. On Wednesday he will meet Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.\n\nFollowing his engagements in Jerusalem, William went to Tel Aviv and, sporting sunglasses and an open-necked shirt, strolled along the Mediterranean shore, chatting with beach-goers and quipping, \"I should have brought my swimming trunks\".\n\nWilliam's trip is at the behest of the British government. Until now it had been British policy not to make an official royal visit until the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was resolved. British officials have given no detailed explanation for the change in policy.\n\nYAD VASHEM\n\nAt Yad Vashem, he met descendants of Jews hidden from the Nazis by his great-grandmother. Wearing a black skullcap, William laid a wreath at Yad Vashem's Hall of Remembrance, where an eternal flame flickers and the names of extermination and concentration camps are engraved in the floor.\n\n\"Terrifying,\" William said, viewing a display at the memorial's museum of shoes taken by the Nazis from Jews at Majdanek death camp. \"(I'm) trying to comprehend the scale.\"\n\nTens of thousands of Jews and other victims were killed at the camp, near Lublin in what is now Poland.\n\n[1/9]Britain's Prince William enters a vehicle upon his arrival at the Ben Gurion International Airport, near Lod, Israel, June 25, 2018.

A devout Christian, she is buried on the slopes of Jerusalem's Mount of Olives. William is due to visit her tomb on Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday in the occupied West Bank, after seeing Abbas, William is scheduled to meet Palestinian youngsters.\n\nAt a meeting with Rivlin, the prince, on a visit described by Britain as non-political, said he hoped \"peace in the area can be achieved\". Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014.\n\n\"I had a very moving tour around Yad Vashem this morning, which really taught me quite a lot more than I thought I already knew about the true horrors of what happened to the Jews\n\nover the war,\" William said at the meeting with Rivlin.\n\nThe prince also spoke at Yad Vashem with two men who survived the Nazi genocide through British intervention.\n\nHenry Foner, 86, and Paul Alexander, 80, were among thousands of Jewish children taken in by Britain as part of the 1930s \"Kindertransport\" from a continental Europe that was falling to German conquest.\n\n\"I said to his Royal Highness that this is a unique opportunity for me to express my thanks to the British people for opening their homes to me and to the other 10,000 children who came,\" Alexander said.\n\nWriting by Jeffrey Heller and Ori Lewis; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "images":
