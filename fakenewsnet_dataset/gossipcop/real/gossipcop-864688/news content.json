News following her February brain tumor diagnosis.\n\n\u201cMy deal ends this August and after that I\u2019m gonna take some time and focus on some passion projects and see what\u2019s next,\u201d the 39-year-old tells PEOPLE. \u201cI\u2019m not rushing into anything.\u201d\n\nThe Sirius XM radio host had been with the company for three years after first joining the E! News team in 2014. In a statement, E! officials thanked Menounos for her \u201cmany contributions\u201d over the years.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts and support go out to Maria and her family and we wish them all the best knowing that Maria will tackled this with the same fierce dedication she is known for,\u201d they said in their statement.\n\nThe news comes just weeks after Menounos underwent a complex, seven-hour surgery, in which doctors were able to remove 99.9 percent of a benign brain tumor.\n\n\u201c[The doctor] said there\u2019s a six to seven percent chance that we\u2019ll see it come back,\u201d she tells PEOPLE in the magazine\u2019s exclusive new cover story. \u201cBut I\u2019ll take those odds any day.\u201d\n\nFor much more from Menounos, pick up the new issue of PEOPLE and watch her emotional interview in PEOPLE Cover Story: Maria Menounos on the People/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN). Go to People.com/PEN or download the PEN app on your favorite mobile or connected TV device.\n\nShe first began recognizing troubling symptoms in February \u2013\u201cI\u2019d been getting lightheaded on set and having headaches,\u201d she says. \u201cMy speech had gotten slurred and I was having difficulty reading the teleprompter.\u201d\n\nShe soon learned that the meningioma brain tumor had been pushing on her facial nerves.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t cry. I actually laughed,\u201d she recalls of hearing the news. \u201cIt\u2019s so surreal and crazy and unbelievable that my mom has a brain tumor\u2014and now I have one too?\u201d\n\nShe remained at the hospital for six days after the June 8 surgery before returning home to heal alongside her mother, Litsa,who has stage 4 brain cancer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have my balance fully yet but as long as I\u2019m holding on to Keven, I\u2019m sturdy and fine,\u201d Menounos says. \u201cMy face is still numb. This is something that takes at least a month of healing, but I\u2019m getting stronger and stronger every day and I\u2019ll be back to normal very soon.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/maria-menounos-enews-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1333px%2C891.84047619048px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/gettyimages-4782605561.jpg?crop=0px%2C138px%2C1999px%2C1336px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/cover-square1.jpg?w=3149&h=3149", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/maria-menounos-kevin.jpg?crop=194px%2C14px%2C1639px%2C1097px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/donal-logue-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1500px%2C1003.5714285714px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/jessa-duggar-5.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1332.7428571429px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/maria-menounos-enews-2000.jpg?w=1333&h=2000", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/maria-mom-bugged1.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1332.7428571429px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/kourtney-kardashian-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C176px%2C1333px%2C891px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/maria-menounos-enews-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1333px%2C699.825px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/maria-menounos-tout-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C151px%2C1333px%2C891px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/jessa-duggar-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1458px%2C975.47142857143px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://people.com/tv/maria-menounos-leaving-e-news-brain-tumor/"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/maria-menounos-enews-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1333px%2C699.825px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Char Adams", "Julie Jordan"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170703191847/http://people.com/tv/maria-menounos-leaving-e-news-brain-tumor/", "title": "Maria Menounos Leaving E!
