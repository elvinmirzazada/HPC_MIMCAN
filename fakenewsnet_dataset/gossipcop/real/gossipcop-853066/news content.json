Does foundation go before or after concealer? Should you put your eyeshadow on first or last? The truth: It\u2019s pretty much all up to personal preference. But after years of being a beauty editor and talking to makeup pros, I\u2019ve found a layering technique that works perfectly for me. For example, I fill in my brows before putting on foundation, since it\u2019s one of the most important steps in my full routine. (So if I\u2019m rushing at the end of my makeup routine, at least my brows will be done.) I also put on setting spray before mascara because I\u2019ve ruined one too many makeup looks with runny black streaks doing it the other way around.\n\nI recommend this same application sequence to my girlfriends when I\u2019m giving impromptu lessons in the bathroom before we go out, but don't worry\u2014you can remove and add steps as you see fit. For instance, I spend more time in areas like brows and highlighter, but you might want to focus your efforts on your eye makeup. I also edit based on how much time I have. I only have five minutes? Then I\u2019m priming, concealing, adding some blush and highlighter, and putting on a quick brow. If I\u2019ve got an entire hour to prep, then I\u2019m going all out. Really, you can customize this guide to fit your needs. Consider this a makeup beginner\u2019s outline to layering your makeup, step by step.\n\nStep 1: Moisturize or apply a primer.\n\nKardashian favorite Mario Dedivanovic says using a hydrating cream before makeup helps all the powders and products you apply on top sink into the skin, making your makeup look less cakey. Since I prefer a dewy makeup look, I spray my face with a mist like MAC Prep + Prime Fix+ ($26). Then I massage in an illuminating primer or oil like Farsali Unicorn Essence ($54). You don\u2019t have to use a product that is marketed as a primer; any moisturizer will do.\n\nStep 2: Fill in brows.", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/5ada0c103cf6f501f02504ee/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Step3_foundation_edit.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ada0c145996d57eda91cc75/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Step10_lip_edit.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/57e1f1b75cea40326a0b0b8c/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6543f0dc16d1566ed34ff402/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ada0c123cf6f501f02504f1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Step6_eyeliner_edit.gif", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ada0c125996d57eda91cc72/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Step5_eyeshadow_edit.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/61f2b0cd898b9838f51324f7/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ada0c163cf6f501f02504f6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Step12_mascara_edit.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/654bc784ffd2a153866c4101/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/65395d418735d567d7dce44b/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ada0c155996d57eda91cc76/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Step8_heighlighter_edit.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ada0c123cf6f501f02504f2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Step7_blush_edit.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ada0c105996d57eda91cc70/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Step2_brow_edit.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ada55463cf6f501f025050d/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/jessica.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ada0c105996d57eda91cc6f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Step4_concealer_edit.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/653ff7f9673a3159f9e2dd68/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/654e526288b333147dcfb100/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/65428e8530045ea1fe57ca97/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ada0c143cf6f501f02504f4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Step9_cotoure_edit.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/65563f7aa80155360d45847f/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ad9fe7c5996d57eda91cc67/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/layering-lede.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/654d4cac420e06d131535cbb/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ada0c155996d57eda91cc78/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Step11_powder_edit.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/653bde406d27c9c0f09e6771/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6542c2406277e8152d0dd807/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5ada55463cf6f501f025050d/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/jessica.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Jessica Cruel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/how-i-apply-my-makeup-every-day", "title": "Here\u2019s a Step-by-Step Guide to How I Apply My Makeup Every Day", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Learning how to apply makeup can be confusing.
