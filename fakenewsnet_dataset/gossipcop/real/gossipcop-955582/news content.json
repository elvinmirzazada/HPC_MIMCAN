Almost two decades later, an executive at CBS contacted her about coming back to the network. It turned out that the executive wanted her to sign a book deal with Simon & Schuster, which is owned by CBS. (CBS said that Moonves has no recollection of making unwelcome advances toward the actress, and that he made no efforts to block future business between her and CBS.)\n\nThe actress thought that the consequences would be too great if she told CBS about the incident. \u201cI never reported it,\u201d she told me. \u201cI just thought, Gee, there goes my career.\u201d At an event not long afterward, she encountered a showrunner who has overseen multiple programs at CBS, and told her the story. The showrunner, who had also worked with Moonves, recalled that the actress was still hurt by the incident and told me that she was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by the story. \u201cI had already had to deal with misogynist bullying from him myself,\u201d she told me.\n\n\u201cOur research has proved that the chicken came not just before the egg but before anything else in the known universe.\u201d Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nTwo women told me that they rebuffed unwanted advances from Moonves in professional settings, and that they believed career opportunities disappeared as a result. Dinah Kirgo, who won an Emmy as a writer for \u201cThe Tracey Ullman Show,\u201d first encountered Moonves in the early eighties, when he was the vice-president of development at Saul Ilson Productions, a partnership with Columbia Pictures Television. She and her sister and producing partner, Julie Kirgo, met with Moonves and others about a television deal. \u201cWe left the meeting very confident we had an over-all deal with Leslie,\u201d Kirgo told me. The sisters told their agent to expect an offer from Moonves.\n\nInstead, shortly after Kirgo got home, Moonves called her directly. \u201cHe said, \u2018That was a great meeting, now we have to go out to dinner,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. Kirgo replied that she and Julie would be happy to have dinner with him. \u201cHe said, \u2018No, just you and me.\u2019 He said, \u2018You\u2019re very expensive, and I need to know you\u2019re worth it,\u2019 \u201d Kirgo told me. \u201cI was sort of in shock and I said, \u2018Well, Leslie, I don\u2019t think your wife would appreciate us having that kind of dinner.\u2019 \u201d Moonves coldly ended the conversation. (CBS said that Moonves has no recollection of the meeting or the phone call.)\n\nKirgo and her sister never heard from Moonves again. Afterward, Kirgo\u2019s agents told her they had received reports that she had a reputation for being difficult to work with. Kirgo told me that she had never heard complaints before, and that she believed saying no to Moonves had hurt her career. \u201cIt\u2019s very insidious, what he did,\u201d she said.\n\nJulie Kirgo confirmed the details of her sister\u2019s story and said that Dinah had told her about the call at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of awful to feel that you have energy and talent and that\u2019s being appreciated, and then suddenly to find out that that\u2019s not where somebody\u2019s interests lie at all. You feel betrayed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt pisses me off to this day.\u201d\n\nIn 1992, a former child star who asked to be identified only by her first name, Kimberly, was introduced to Moonves by a friend, who was a member of Moonves\u2019s staff and told her that Moonves could help her get back into television. At a dinner meeting that the three attended, Moonves began by asking questions about Kimberly\u2019s acting career. But when the friend went to the bathroom Moonves turned to Kimberly and said, in a perfunctory way, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s just get a hotel room. Let\u2019s just do this.\u201d She was shocked. \u201cI said, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019 \u201d When she explained that she had a husband and a child, Moonves became angry and left. (The friend recalled making the introduction to Moonves, and said that her only motivation in doing so was to help Kimberly\u2019s career. CBS said that Moonves has no memory or record of the meeting.)\n\n\u201cThe power differential was so great,\u201d Kimberly told me. \u201cI was really scared, because I thought I was burning some sort of a bridge that was going to be great for me.\u201d As a child star, she said, \u201cI\u2019d been taught that powerful people can hurt you, they can ruin you, they can ruin your career.\u201d She said that the turn from business meeting to sexual overture seemed to be well practiced. \u201cIt was set up to be that way,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought, Wow, is this the way the world works and I just don\u2019t get it?\u201d\n\nCBS is a multibillion-dollar corporation, with dozens of divisions, and Moonves is only indirectly involved with many of them. However, experts on sexual harassment told me that misconduct by a chief executive can reverberate across aspects of even the largest companies. \u201cIf you have a company with an abuser on the top, they typically surround themselves with people like them, who engage in similar behavior,\u201d Debra Katz, a lawyer specializing in sexual harassment, told me. \u201cIt can put a set of enablers in place, who protect powerful people when they get challenged for misconduct, and who work to discredit and manage out women who come forward with allegations.\u201d\n\nThirty current and former CBS employees described harassment, gender discrimination, or retaliation at the network. Many said that men accused of misconduct were promoted, even after the company was made aware of those allegations. Their stories match several that have already emerged in public reports. Earlier this year, Leslie Isaacs, a vice-president at Pop, the cable channel jointly operated by CBS and the film studio Lionsgate, filed a lawsuit alleging that CBS was aware of a hostile workplace at the channel. Her complaint described harassment and discrimination by male colleagues, including a vice-president who allegedly instructed female employees to \u201cshow your clients your tits.\u201d Isaacs told me, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be happening at Pop if it wasn\u2019t covered up at CBS, and if CBS wasn\u2019t complicit. They know, and it\u2019s been tolerated.\u201d (Isaacs has entered into a private mediation process with CBS. A Pop spokesperson said, \u201cPop engaged an independent investigator who conducted a complete investigation and found nothing to corroborate this alleged statement.\u201d CBS said that it flatly denies any efforts to cover this up.)\n\nIn December, CBS confirmed that Brad Kern, the showrunner and executive producer of \u201cNCIS: New Orleans,\u201d had been the subject of sexual-harassment and gender-discrimination allegations. He had retained his position for more than a year after the company was made aware of the claims. (This season, Kern stepped down from his position as showrunner, but he remains a consulting producer. Last month, the company said that it was launching a new investigation\u2014its third\u2014into Kern\u2019s behavior. CBS said that the allegations were investigated and resulted in disciplinary action but that the matter \u201cmerits further inquiry.\u201d)\n\nOther allegations have centered on CBS News. Last summer, Erin Gee, who worked at CBS for more than fifteen years, filed a lawsuit alleging that an executive director at \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d urged her to have sex with a co-worker with whom she was having difficulties in order to \u201cbreak the ice,\u201d and that she was demoted after complaining about gender discrimination. In May, a magistrate judge in New York criticized CBS for failing to save e-mails from the time of Gee\u2019s allegation. \u201cI find the conduct of CBS here to be shocking,\u201d the judge, Sarah Netburn, reportedly said during a hearing. \u201cIt is hard to draw any other conclusion than that they were trying to avoid producing and saving those e-mails.\u201d (The network has since reached a settlement with Gee, and her attorney declined to comment. CBS said that \u201cthe matter has been resolved.\u201d) In 2015, a CBS reporter, Kenneth Lombardi, alleged in a lawsuit that a CBS News supervisor texted him links to pornography, and that a senior producer had grabbed his crotch. Lombardi claimed that when he complained to a manager she replied, \u201cNever bring up gender discrimination again!\u201d (An attorney for Lombardi said that he was not at liberty to discuss the suit. CBS said that the matter has been resolved.)", "images": ["https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_image.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_360%2Cq_80%2Cw_480/v1532962438/thenewyorker_how-a-notorious-d-e-a-informant-busted-criminals.jpg", "https://www.newyorker.com/verso/static/the-new-yorker/assets/logo-header-reverse.svg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b5b36849246473a2ac794ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/180806_r32520_rd.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b5b36849246473a2ac794ab/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/180806_r32520_rd.jpg", "https://www.newyorker.com/verso/static/the-new-yorker/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a202dae8989ed395dbb8178/4:3/w_480%2Cc_limit/DSF-Matt-Lauers-Firing-and-NBCs-Theater-of-Accountability.jpg", "https://www.newyorker.com/verso/static/the-new-yorker/assets/logo-inverted.svg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ad6062051fedf7258aa438c/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/648ce6c1ef09d4a0e04c7c5b/4:3/w_480%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5b5b7c343e47e60bb379a34d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/180806_a22032.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5b5b7c3492497e4fd0017bb4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/180806_a21101_rd.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5b5b7c3487b14c6938366779/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/180806_a20641.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/5b5b7c3487b14c693836677a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/180806_a21846.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/590979628b51cf59fc423803/4:3/w_480%2Cc_limit/%25E2%2580%258BTalbot-FoxNewsAndTheRepercussionsOfSexualHarassment.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b5b36849246473a2ac794ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/180806_r32520_rd.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Ronan Farrow"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/06/les-moonves-and-cbs-face-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct", "title": "Les Moonves and CBS Face Allegations of Sexual Misconduct", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Ronan Farrow reports: Six women accuse the C.E.O. of harassment and intimidation, and dozens more describe abuse at his company.", "id": "5b58962892497e4fd001741c", "keywords": "cbs,sexual harassment,television,#metoo,women,illeana douglas,actresses", "news_keywords": "cbs,sexual harassment,television,#metoo,women,illeana douglas,actresses", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b58962892497e4fd001741c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Ronan Farrow reports: Six women accuse the C.E.O. of harassment and intimidation, and dozens more describe abuse at his company.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b5b36849246473a2ac794ab/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/180806_r32520_rd.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b5b36849246473a2ac794ab/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/180806_r32520_rd.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Six women accuse the C.E.O. of harassment and intimidation, and dozens more describe abuse at his company.", "image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b5b36849246473a2ac794ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/180806_r32520_rd.jpg", "site_name": "The New Yorker", "title": "Les Moonves and CBS Face Allegations of Sexual Misconduct", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/06/les-moonves-and-cbs-face-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-07-27T21:37:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-07-27T21:37:00.000Z", "author": "Ronan Farrow"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@NewYorker", "description": "Six women accuse the C.E.O. of harassment and intimidation, and dozens more describe abuse at his company.", "domain": "https://www.newyorker.com", "image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b5b36849246473a2ac794ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/180806_r32520_rd.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@NewYorker", "title": "Les Moonves and CBS Face Allegations of Sexual Misconduct"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5b5b36849246473a2ac794ab/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/180806_r32520_rd.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1147169538698836, "pages": 9258148868}, "google-signin-client_id": "275906274807-b4eqbdqr511u9msdpj8mh0pf77fcciv7.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533502800.0, "source": "https://www.newyorker.com", "summary": ""}
