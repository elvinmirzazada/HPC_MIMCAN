The engagement, her first without Prince Harry, is slated to include a tour of the items on display, meetings with the curators, and even a performance by a M\u0101ori cultural group. Markle wore a calf-length black dress by Givenchy for the occasion.\n\nThe Royal Academy is one of the Queen's patronages, and the objects featured in Oceania are from regions including New Zealand, Fiji, Tonga, and Australia, which Meghan and Harry are slated to visit on a royal tour next month.\n\nKate Middleton\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge held her own when she filled in for Prince Charles at a charity dinner at Clarence House, according to The Telegraph. The event took place on October 27, 2011, six months after her wedding to Prince William.\n\nThe engagement benefited In Kind Direct, one of the Prince's charities, which supplies consumer goods to nonprofit organizations. Middleton, who dressed in a vintage Amanda Wakeley gown, spoke to supporters and funders throughout the night.\n\nHandout // Getty Images\n\nPrincess Diana\n\nThe Princess of Wales did her first royal event alone at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton, Surrey, The Telegraph reported. The appearance\u2014which took place on December 8, 1982, over a year after her royal wedding to Prince Charles\u2014was \"the first of many visits to the hospital and its sick patients,\" according to the paper.\n\n\n\nThe trip also foreshadowed the princess' devoted work to the sick. She would go on to be remembered for her commitment to raising awareness for HIV/AIDS and supporting those who were plighted by the disease.\n\nTim Graham // Getty Images", "images":
