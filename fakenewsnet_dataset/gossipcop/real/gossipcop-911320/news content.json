However, sneakers are now en vogue, with the best sneaker brands constantly innovating new and stylish footwear. Attitudes have shifted in unforeseen ways and what was once the scruffy outlier is now the footwear gold standard.\n\nThe transition from running track to the runway has been a slow and gradual one, but in recent years it has reached a crescendo; a crescendo that looks set to blare on indefinitely. This is thanks in no small part to a number of key designers and best shoe brands who have been pushing footwear to its limits in every conceivable direction.\n\nSome have created white leather kicks that look right at home with tailoring. Others are inventing technology that might as well have come straight out of a lab at Area 51 (or just Back to the Future). Meanwhile, there are those who have elevated the sneaker from its utilitarian roots to the absolute pinnacle of high fashion it is today.\n\nHere we take a look at the most influential sneaker brands in the world right now and what they\u2019re doing to help elevate the world\u2019s favorite footwear.\n\nYeah, in 2016 Nike really did go back to the future and produced Marty McFly\u2019s self-lacing sneakers. But this is just one instance when the brand seemingly reached through a tear in spacetime and brought us something directly from the future, making it the biggest trendsetter in sneakers and a reliable barometer for what\u2019s around the corner.\n\nFounded in 1964 by University of Oregon track-and-field coach Bill Bowerman, the brand has a long track record of world-beating performance footwear as well as technological innovation (Flyknit uppers and NikeID personalization in the last decade). More than that, Nike knows how to create products that live up to their considerable hype and make great gifts for sneakerheads. It has more icons in its back catalog than any other sneaker brand. Air Max, Air Force 1, and Air Jordan are all sneaker dynasties in their own right and go back further and you\u2019ll find even more classic retro sneakers like the Cortez and the Blazer.\n\nStill the most recognizable. Still the most wanted. Still, the ones to beat.\n\nWho would have thought that a leather specialist would be one of the best sneaker brands in the world? On top of timeless dress shoes, Morjas crafts slick suede and leather sneakers that you\u2019ll still be wearing ten years down the road.\n\nSince Morjas delivers its shoes directly to the consumer, it cuts out the middleman and reduces costs without skimping on quality. All shoes are made at Morjas\u2019 factory in a small village in Spain with impeccable craftsmanship and fine detailing. It\u2019s the little things that count, and we\u2019re huge fans of sneaker brands that prioritize quality in their products.\n\nMorjas sneakers are ideal for the modern man who\u2019s tired of the same old runners. The brand\u2019s sneakers are suitable for both work and play, complementing anything from smart casual to Sunday sweatsuits. With 3 signature styles, Morjas keeps it simple, complete with stunning neutral colorways and a comfort-driven fit.\n\nLuxury at an accessible price point, Swedish brand Myqvist has cracked the code. They\u2019ve cut down on retail costs by shipping directly to their customers, which results in high quality sneakers at a fraction of the price. Though they specialize in dress shoes, Myqvist is also one of the best sneaker brands in the world, thanks to its elegant designs.\n\nThis brand should be your first port of call for all things fancy sneakers. If you\u2019re looking for something to wear to the office, the calf leather Oaxen\u2019s are as good as any derbies \u2013 especially since the leather comes from the Hermes-owned tannery in France.\n\nBut if you\u2019re hunting for more weekend wear, we\u2019re really vibing with Myrqvit\u2019s take on the suede dad sneaker. Wear them with joggers or jeans, you\u2019ll look equally as posh.\n\nL\u00f8ci is disrupting the fashion industry with its ultra-environmentally friendly shoes. In fact, each sneaker made removes 20 plastic bottles from the ocean. Combining vegan and recycled materials, L\u00f8ci sneakers have come to life, saving our feet and the planet at the same damn time.\n\nThis men\u2019s sneaker brand takes eco-conscious to the next level, with the body of the shoes crafted entirely from recycled ocean plastic that\u2019s sourced from the Mediterranean Sea and the coast of Africa. The rest of the sneaker is outfitted with innovative materials, like a comfy cork insole, breathable bamboo lining, and a natural rubber sole.\n\nBut what really stands out is you don\u2019t have to choose between style and sustainability. L\u00f8ci sneakers come in tons of casual forms, from low to high tops. Choose from dozens of colors and bold patterns, or play it safe with a subtle monochrome and your favorite laid-back \u2018fit. Whichever way you lean, L\u00f8ci\u2019s are a solid bet if you\u2019re looking for a responsibly made sneaker that doesn\u2019t fall flat in the fashion department.\n\nOriginally founded in 1908, UK brand Crown Northampton has had plenty of time to perfect its craft. Made using traditional methods from some of the finest materials in the world, this sneaker brand has a strong heritage with plenty of modern-day updates, best seen in their sneaker line.\n\nAn upscale minimalist\u2019s dream, the brand excels in hand-stitched leather designs with sleek neutral colorways and flattering cuts. Been hunting for the perfect leather high tops? Trade out your Chuck Taylors for the Abington shoe, a sophisticated calf leather alternative. Rather stick to low cut designs? The Harleston will replace even your nicest dress shoes.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to retire your scruffy kicks, Crown Northampton offers unique upgrades to step up your sneaker game.\n\nThe twenty first century brought with it a whole lot of new sneaker brands. Old timers like Nike , Adidas, and even Converse have been around for ages, so it was about time the world saw some newcomers break into the market.\n\nCLAE hopped on the sneaker train in 2001 and has become well loved and respected in the footwear world. Based in Los Angeles, CLAE was developed out of pure passion, along with a love for elegant materials and timeless silhouettes. They utilize premium vegan materials in their sneaker construction, alongside leather and suede. The styles span from trendy to timeless, with something for every kind of man.\n\nCLAE sneakers are best for the guy who\u2019s looking for something different. Whether you choose lace ups, slip ons, high tops, or basketball shoes, there are enough styles to provide variety without being overwhelming. The brand is constantly at the forefront of new designs, so if you\u2019re looking to shake things up without getting too fancy with it, CLAE is the brand for you.\n\nThe casual running shoe world has felt stagnant for quite some time, with the same brands cropping up all over and over. If the big names aren\u2019t doing it for you, try Aur\u00e9lien who lives by their coined phrase \u2018Smart Luxury.\u2019 What is that? To the brand, it means unmatched quality for the price point \u2013 no reason you need to remortgage your home to look good.\n\n\n\nOne of their signature shoes, the sustainable Playtime sneaker, was designed with foot anatomy in mind for next-level comfort. Great for long outings or bar hops, these lightweight and eco-friendly sneakers are ready to meet the challenge of looking good and feeling good head-on.\n\nA Swedish sneaker brand that\u2019s made a splash in the luxury market, Axel Arigato does not disappoint when it comes to footwear. Their timeless style hits a sweet spot between Swedish and Japanese design that\u2019s strikingly minimalist, but never boring.\n\nAnyone fashion-forward gentleman looking to update his sneaker game will greatly benefit from a pair of these kicks. A smattering of simple designs, a handful of neutral colors, and thoughtful details are what you can expect in the footwear department, ideal for the modern man looking for a new go-to sneaker brand.\n\nTake these shoes from the office to happy hour to an evening out on the town and rack up compliments along the way.\n\nChanging the sneaker game since 2015, Oliver Cabell has revolutionized the way we look at and think about designer kicks. With a plethora of high-end styles to choose from, sans the luxury good price markup, Oliver Cabell is one of the best sneaker brands in the world today as they\u2019ve made designer shoes accessible to the masses.\n\nBut not only are Oliver Cabell \u2018s sneakers impossibly stylish, but they make the perfect building blocks for a put-together outfit, whether you\u2019ll be spending the day out on the town or cooped up in the boardroom.\n\nCrafted with only the finest Italian leather using old-school techniques, it\u2019s safe to say that you\u2019ll never be disappointed with a pair of kicks from this life-changing sneaker brand.\n\nThe Brits do minimalism well, which is why they have some of the best sneaker brands in the world. Uniform Standard checks all the boxes when it comes to the perfect sneakers for men: smart enough to dress up, plenty casual for laid back days, and high quality construction that won\u2019t fall apart, even after dozens of wears.\n\nUsing traditional shoe making methods with modern design principles, Uniform Standard specializes in premium full grain leather sneakers. There are eight \u201cseries\u201d (shoe models) to choose from, with frequent colorway updates, multiple material options, and thoughtful detailing. We dig the Series 2 slip ons as an alternative to Vans and the Series 5 for more of a retro form with a contemporary twist.\n\nThough they\u2019re still relative newcomers to the game \u2013 the brand was founded in 2018 \u2013 we love what we\u2019re seeing so far and are hopeful for the future of this fledgling sneaker brand. Choose Uniform Standard if you\u2019re looking for shoes to complete any smart casual outfit or need a change of pace from the same old players.\n\nThe ongoing technological arms race between the world\u2019s sneaker brands the big hitters has produced some of the boldest innovations in footwear. Luckily for us, it doesn\u2019t show any sign of letting up.\n\nAsk any sneakerhead on the street who\u2019s in pole position, and they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s Nike . However, with featherlight materials and mind-bending sole technology, it could be easily argued that good old three-stripes is maneuvering for an overtake. Established in 1949, Adidas has become a global phenomenon led by science.\n\nThere are the beloved classics \u2014 the Superstar, Stan Smith, and Gazelle all come to mind \u2014 and they\u2019re not going away, but in recent years the brand\u2019s R&D lab has become the sneaker world\u2019s Q branch. Forget the Yeezy collab, it was the Ultra Boost that changed the game, and most recently, the German sports giant has been experimenting with 3D printing as a production method for groundbreaking webbed sole units. Don\u2019t take your eyes off them for a second.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible (and slightly terrifying) to think about how much the world has evolved in the last 100 years. Commercial flight, television, mobile phones, and the internet are just a few of the inventions that have revolutionized the way we live.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s a real triumph of design when something introduced a century ago is still being used globally today.\n\nConverse\u2019s famous high-top, the Chuck Taylor All Star, is one such item. Born in 1917, the iconic basketball shoe has remained 99.9 percent unchanged and is now the best-selling shoe in the US, UK, and far beyond. Yes, this sneaker brand has other excellent shoes, like the Run Star Motion and the Chuck 70s, but this is arguably the most iconic sneaker ever made. And what\u2019s more, it\u2019s for everyone.\n\nWhen luxury New York sneaker brand Common Projects first introduced its Achilles Low model in 2004, the menswear world went mad for it. But why? Was it innovative? No. Was it next-level comfortable? Hardly. Did it come in at bargain prices? Quite the opposite.\n\nThis shoe was nothing more than a plain, leather sneaker. However, the thing that had the fash pack fawning over this minimalist trainer was that every little detail was meticulously executed to the nth degree. This was a sneaker created like an Oxford shoe handcrafted in Northamptonshire.\n\nButtery Italian leather, exquisite streamlined shapeliness, and timeless wearability made each pair the perfect accompaniment to anything from a suit to shorts. It arguably started today\u2019s thriving luxury sneaker market, and all of this, in a world now dominated by Balenciaga beetle-crushers, is not to be taken for granted.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDI0MyIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNDMiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDIzMiIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyMzIiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDI4OCIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyODgiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDI1NiIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNTYiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgODYyIDExMzgiIHdpZHRoPSI4NjIiIGhlaWdodD0iMTEzOCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48L3N2Zz4=", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDI2NyIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNjciIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MrP_BestSneakerBrands.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTM2IDExOTAiIHdpZHRoPSI5MzYiIGhlaWdodD0iMTE5MCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48L3N2Zz4=", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDIyMSIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyMjEiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNjk2IDU2NSIgd2lkdGg9IjY5NiIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1NjUiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDI0MSIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNDEiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDI1MCIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNTAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-kMpkBqxCNfhNp.gif", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMzAwIDczIiB3aWR0aD0iMzAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjczIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDMxOCIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzMTgiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDIzOSIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyMzkiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNDAwIDQwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjQwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI0MDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDIwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyMDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTUwIDM2IiB3aWR0aD0iMTUwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM2IiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDIxNSIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyMTUiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTA1IDE2NSIgd2lkdGg9IjEwNSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNjUiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDI0NCIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNDQiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDIzMyIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyMzMiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTAwIDMwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjUwMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzMDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+"], "top_img": "https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MrP_BestSneakerBrands.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Fashionbeans Editors"], "canonical_link": "https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-sneaker-brands/", "title": "26 Best Sneaker Brands For Men: Top Styles and Companies 2023", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The world's best sneaker brands are locked in a technological arms race and all-out hype warfare, but which ones are winning?
