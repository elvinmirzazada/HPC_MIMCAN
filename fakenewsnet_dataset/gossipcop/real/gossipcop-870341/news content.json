Henson) and Lucious (Terrence Howard) struggling with their decisions for Lyon Family Management in the present day \u2014 and a flashback to when they were really hurting after just losing Empire, following Eddie\u2019s death.\n\nLucious makes the mistake of alluding to Cookie being the reason the record company fell through their fingers, and she is not having it. She storms out and that\u2019s when we see her first encounter with Damon Cross (Wood Harris), the shady money manager who has been up to no good in the present day.\n\nFans will remember a flash-forward showed Lucious, while mourning at the mysterious funeral, looking at some cozy pics of Cross and Cookie. And now we might know why, seeing as Cross is already trying to put the moves on Cookie from the moment they first meet at a hotel bar.\n\nHere\u2019s the official description for Wednesday\u2019s episode, titled \u201cMaster of What Is Mine Own\u201d:\n\nThe cost of running Lyon Family Management starts to put pressure on Cookie and Lucious\u2019 relationship. When Kingsley pulls a power move of his own that has major financial repercussions for Lucious, Cookie thinks back to their early struggles. Kai (guest star Toby Onwumere) becomes upset when Jamal announces their engagement on live TV and Tiana hits a crossroad with Hakeem, who refuses to set aside his beef with Blake. Meanwhile, Candace becomes vindictive after feeling betrayed by Cookie and Giselle uncovers a key to her future.\n\nWatch the clip above.\n\n\u201cEmpire\u201d airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on Fox.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dwts-s32-semifinals.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lessons-in-Chemistry-Harriet-Aja.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/the-masked-singer-cow.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Damon-Cross-Empire.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Thomas-Augsberger.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Damon-Cross-Empire.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas", "Ross A.
