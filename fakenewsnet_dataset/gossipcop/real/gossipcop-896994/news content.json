{"url": "https://people.com/tv/matt-lauer-accuser-lawyer-speaks-out/", "text": "A lawyer representing the woman accusing Matt Lauer of \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior\u201d has spoken out.\n\nIn a statement provided to the New York Times, Ari Wilkenfeld, a civil rights lawyer with the firm Wilkenfeld, Herendeen & Atkinson in Washington, confirmed he represents the woman who made the complaint to NBC, but declined to publicly identify her.\n\nIt was announced Wednesday that Lauer, 59, had been terminated by NBC News after the network received on Monday night a \u201cdetailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,\u201d with reason to believe \u201cthis may not have been an isolated incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy client and I met with representatives from NBC\u2019s Human Resources and Legal Departments at 6 p.m. on Monday for an interview that lasted several hours,\u201d said Wilkenfeld. \u201cOur impression at this point is that NBC acted quickly, as all companies should, when confronted with credible allegations of sexual misconduct in the workplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I am encouraged by NBC\u2019s response to date, I am in awe of the courage my client showed to be the first to raise a complaint and to do so without making any demands other than the company do the right thing,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe Times met with the woman Monday afternoon, but she told the newspaper she was not ready to come forward and tell her story publicly.\n\nMatt Lauer. Charles Sykes/Invision/AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nLauer, who joined the network in 1992 as a newsreader on Today, had been co-anchor of the morning show since January 1997 and reportedly signed a $20 million dollar contract last year. His termination comes after a string of firings of top stars in television news, following the ouster of Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly last April and CBS\u2019 Charlie Rose earlier this month.\n\n\u201cOn Monday night, we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer. It represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company\u2019s standards. As a result, we\u2019ve decided to terminate his employment,\u201d Andrew Lack, chairman of NBC News, said in a statement. \u201cWhile it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years he\u2019s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.\n\n\u201cOur highest priority is to create a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected, and to ensure that any actions that run counter to our core values are met with consequences, no matter who the offender,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are deeply saddened by this turn of events. But we will face it together as a news organization \u2014 and do it in as transparent a manner as we can. To that end, Noah and I will be meeting with as many of you as possible throughout the day today to answer your questions.\u201d\n\nA source told PEOPLE Lauer was fired after alleged inappropriate sexual behavior throughout 2014, including at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\nAn NBC staffer filed a complaint Monday \u201cthat was serious enough that he was terminated,\u201d the source explained. \u201cThe accuser described inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace occurring throughout 2014.\u201d\n\nReps for Lauer declined to comment.\n\nA Today source, meanwhile, told PEOPLE the team was shocked by the news.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a death in the family. Everybody is crying,\u201d said the source. \u201cNo one knows what the f\u2014 happened.\u201d", "images":
