Peace and love. Ringo.\u201d\n\nFun fact: Starr, McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison were all recognized as Members of the Order of the British Empire in 1965.\n\nPaul McCartney and Ringo Starr in January 2014 Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nBarry Gibb, the last surviving member of the Bee Gees, dedicated his knighthood to his late bandmates, twin brothers Robin Gibb, who died in 2012, and Maurice Gibb, who died in 2003.\n\n\u201cI want to acknowledge how responsible my brothers are for this honor,\u201d Gibb, 71, said. \u201cIt is as much theirs as it is mine. This is a moment in life to be treasured and never forgotten.\u201d\n\nTwice a year, Britain\u2019s Cabinet Office releases a list of the people receiving honors for merit, service or bravery \u2014 just before New Year\u2019s Eve, and on the Saturday in June when Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s birthday is officially observed.\n\nHugh Laurie Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic\n\nAlso on the 2018 New Year roster was actor Hugh Laurie, who was named a Commander of the British Empire.\n\nA knighthood or damehood is the highest honor awarded in the five categories approved by the Queen.\n\nThe second highest is a CBE or Commander of the Order of the British Empire followed by an OBE, or Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire and then an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nThe U.K. Press Association reported that future honors lists will recognize first responders of the Grenfell Tower fire from earlier this year which killed 71 people in London.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/hugh-laurie.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/mccartney-starr-1-2000.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957im_/http://people.com/img/sign-up-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/article-covers/3313_106804645_2016_05_02_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/starr-gibb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/starr-gibb.jpg?w=1200"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/starr-gibb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957/http://people.com/royals/ringo-starr-barry-gibb-awarded-knighthoods-in-queens-new-years-honors/", "title": "Ringo Starr, Barry Gibb Knighted in Queen's New Year's Honors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "ringo starr, barry gibb, hugh laurie, queen's honor, knighthood, queen elizabeth, the beatles, beegees", "news_keywords": "ringo starr, barry gibb, hugh laurie, queen's honor, knighthood, queen elizabeth, the beatles, beegees", "description": "Ringo Starr and Barry Gibb officially become Sirs!", "og": {"title": "Ringo Starr, Barry Gibb Knighted in Queen's New Year's Honors", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957/http://people.com/royals/ringo-starr-barry-gibb-awarded-knighthoods-in-queens-new-years-honors/", "description": "Ringo Starr and Barry Gibb officially become Sirs!", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/starr-gibb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://people.com/royals/ringo-starr-barry-gibb-awarded-knighthoods-in-queens-new-years-honors/", "description": "Ringo Starr and Barry Gibb officially become Sirs!", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/starr-gibb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957im_/http://people.com/royals/ringo-starr-barry-gibb-awarded-knighthoods-in-queens-new-years-honors/", "title": "Ringo Starr and Barry Gibb Awarded Knighthoods in Queen's New Year's Honors", "description": "Ringo Starr and Barry Gibb officially become Sirs!", "site": "@people", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171230023957im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/starr-gibb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
