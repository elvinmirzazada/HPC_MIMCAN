He did not know how many times Locklear struck him. Locklear bit his face and described Locklear as being \u2018all over\u2019 him for the last 20-30 minutes acting \u2018crazy,\u2019 \u2018angry,\u2019 and \u2018wild.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHeather Locklear/Instagram.\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, \u201cLocklear exhibited combative, belligerent, and aggressive behavior toward deputies,\u201d Hall wrote.\n\nHe called her behavior \u201cagitated and uncooperative,\u201d writing that, \u201cLocklear grabbed Deputy Alldredge by the bicep and pulled on it while ordering him to get out of the house.\u201d\n\nHall continued: \u201cLocklear walked to her bedroom and began to close the door. Deputy Alldredge put his foot in the doorway to prevent her from closing it, and to continue the investigation. Heather attempted to push Deputy Alldredge out of the doorway, and screamed, \u2018Get the f\u2014 out of my house!\u2019 She battered Deputy Alldredge by kicking him in his shin in an attempt to get his foot out of the doorway. The source was strong enough to force Deputy Alldredge\u2019s leg out of the doorway.\u201d\n\n\u201cSergeant Camou asked Locklear to exit the bedroom several times before she complied,\u201d Hall added in the documents. \u201cShe continued to yell and scream at the deputies to leave her house while pacing back and forth in a very aggressive manner. Locklear yelled profanities at the deputies and tried to physically push Sergeant Camou and Deputy Nesgis with her hands out of the house.\u201d\n\nREX/Shutterstock\n\nEventually, Locklear was placed under arrest. \u201cSergeant Camou had to grab Locklear\u2019s arms to restrain her,\u201d Hall wrote. \u201cLocklear continued to struggle and resist as Deputy Nesgis handcuffed her. Locklear was lying on her stomach handcuffed. As Deputy Nesgis rolled Heather on to her right side to stand her up, she kicked Sergeant Camou with her left foot. \u2026 Due to her combative behavior, deputies place a hobble around Locklear\u2019s ankles to prevent her from kicking deputies.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018You f\u2014\u2014 deserve your kids to die! You f\u2014\u2014 deserve it!\u2019 \u201d Hall said Locklear told Deputy Nesgis in the report. \u201c\u2018And when you find yourself in that position, think of me!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018I hope no one f\u2014\u2014- burns your entire department down, your f\u2014\u2014 police department,\u2019 \u201d Hall claims Locklear told deputies, according to the report. \u201cGet the f\u2014 off my property. Don\u2019t ever come on it. All of you are not allowed \u2026 I will shoot you if you come on my property and take that as a threat and f\u2014\u2014 put another count against me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt was that threat to \u201cshoot\u201d officers that triggered the search warrant of her house. On Tuesday, police searched Locklear\u2019s home for the firearm that is said to be allegedly registered in her name, but they didn\u2019t find it.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Heather Locklear\u2019s Boyfriend Charged with a DUI Hours After Her Felony Domestic Battery Arrest\n\nHours after her arrest, Heisser was arrested for DUI. It is not clear if he has entered a plea.\n\nMeanwhile, since her arrest, Locklear has sought help for her battle with addiction. \u201cHeather is in treatment for addiction,\u201d a friend of the actress told PEOPLE. \u201cEveryone hopes she gets well, that she gets better.\u201d\n\n\u201cAddiction is obviously a strong disease and as much as friends and family who love her and want her to get better and be happy, no one can do the work for her,\u201d added the friend. \u201cHopefully she is getting the help she needs.\u201d\n\nPaul Archuleta/FilmMagic\n\nLocklear has struggled with substance abuse in the past, and this isn\u2019t her first time in treatment. In March 2008, her doctor called 911 reporting that she was suicidal, and that June, she sought help for psychological issues. She left the Arizona facility after four weeks.\n\nThat September, the actress was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in California and was formally charged in November 2008 with driving under the influence of drugs. The misdemeanor charge filed by the DA\u2019s office specified that the drugs in question were \u201cprescription medications.\u201d She completed a 30-day in-patient rehab program. However, in January 2009, the case was dismissed.\n\nAnd in 2012, she was hospitalized after a 911 call was placed from her home, reportedly after she ingested a mixture of drugs and alcohol. After she was discharged, she went \u201cunder a doctor\u2019s care\u201d but did not head to in-patient rehab, a source told PEOPLE.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/Iu7nDsWNaUzw5f3NNRcpvBp5b60=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(344x0:346x2)/heather-locklear-1-2f7a44f736eb4cfe929f57bb8036435f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/gqKRuZ3fWC1qZi2ygy6qJN20Gpk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Oaklee-Mae-Snow-033023-83fd83a196ec40aeb6ae6a6e57ed5858.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/UqmS7zD7QZ9ntyTmy-7dUzS3MbE=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/248515971_423792849226570_1672372709981615183_n-1e64af70e89941cfacf15401180d1334.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/WnhwrZY0O7d-gMz1kKuFRv16IAg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x225:941x227)/Jonathan-Majors-032623-2000-6d6b86b153604fdebd3cc60094dc4269.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/dyeSiWf5OWFMG0GswCUm70UdtNI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(944x399:946x401)/Teen-Mom-Ryan-Edwards-01-030123-dd50715b87274bfcb0f3df57bfed4b58.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/CZgyI2I_m1PyDcFQXXyyLfZ4XN4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x329:721x331)/Benjamin-Obadiah-Foster-013123-4e5b6cb451b04349af8e62058460f280.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/p7JqduC0FQOTWRF2DKs31EVJLrU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x539:961x541)/tom-sizemore-1-de246974d78443ccbf3252396a2ea255.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/y5xY4elJP-ao9i1P7hHSp5UOQJI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x189:736x191)/Taylor-Frankie-Paul-031923-Split-ca422357c23849959b77bc14e42a1ba0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/O0imz2KzSsF0NcIVIEnjSmDnC-s=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/James-Craig-and-murder-victim-Angela-Craig-032123-da3f2bc9628245fb889c578ee432dc7a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/DbpBsdOZEqVHfDqDSA-L-yCAIxM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(989x558:991x560)/Chad-Doerman-061923-02-7a7afd70c6ee427c8d585c45108366d0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/akuWij6xP-EqBY4IgN9pqNWXyKs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(15137x18399:15139x18401)/heather-locklear-boyfriend-5b7b5b4332364d149209f9a2c4c4bf01.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Zt5yj6qO8MZ1P_H7eGk5Khk2Qr8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(571x13:573x15)/honey-boo-boo-bf-dralin-carswell-030223-64431a1144f146999c1d56a30a409546.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZibUzzp-IvGiJmPKDYaKwuXoeog=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Bobbie-Jean-mugshot-061423-22547f0f09f54753aab88318a7e843a2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HBkZlgfU7-Fj29YCSCq5y9gNv4k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(584x15:586x17)/mohammad-alkurdi-police-031723-4e650d1fab3b4b81a921f8c1113b2f1a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/MB2KFdlirLJ9laJz77e3GVQrKl4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/chris-beard-texas-longhorns-coach-010623-1-5388053693754c22a675cad2a6dda206.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/34vIfTXifWS-nnRLrrihbM0MLkk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/heather-locklear1-1-aef656cfdad14ba6b514c50a8d636b1d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7GHhuScWvMG9_reIgZY-IufDqZ8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(779x479:781x481)/Nathan-Griffith-Teen-Mom-01-022423-10e860c76be1448384d472af8ba1f91c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-NyWqQLQU6ryIpPpjLotZ1JXKik=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/heather-locklear-1-2000-99aeb523eedd46f19d0c85f3ea0d64ee.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/kKJpUr8CAoUfvuZZ_60ZX0TxVYo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/placentia-crash-20230126_53-ee708ed913bc4233a6eb3089d679bac8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/XUX8XiiWBVyj1dCdC8buF_vphGU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/mike-clevinger-012523-3-c71139127cd74b0b8a7faeb7d6b895db.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rhb2c9vmxAmz3k6WuJCGkx4Rhm0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(809x399:811x401)/christopher-pullease-florida-072222-df7e1ed9f7474c458928ff6b32766a32.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/34vIfTXifWS-nnRLrrihbM0MLkk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/heather-locklear1-1-aef656cfdad14ba6b514c50a8d636b1d.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn", "People Editorial Guidelines", "Maria Pasquini Is The Staff Editor For Human Interest S Digital Vertical At People.
