They took that literally: The cover features the lifestyle site\u2019s founder and CEO, Gwyneth Paltrow, topless and slathered in mud from head to toe.\n\nRelated: Ashley Graham Slayed in a Teeny String Bikini \u2014 Shop the Swimsuit and More From Her Line Ashley Graham slayed in a teeny Swimsuits For All bikini in a Wednesday, August 9, Instagram \u2014 shop the swimsuit and more\n\nThe 96-page magazine debut, which retails for a hefty price (like all things Goop) of $15, is the first iteration of a new quarterly publication. Just like the online brand, the book will feature wellness advice, clean beauty secrets, healthy recipes and more.\n\nThe Fall 2017 issue, specifically, covers a makeup-bag detox, deep-dives into crystals and mud masks, a do-anywhere workout from fitness guru Tracy Anderson, fall fashion, tips for a better orgasm and a candid conversation with Paltrow, 44, herself.\n\nThank You!
