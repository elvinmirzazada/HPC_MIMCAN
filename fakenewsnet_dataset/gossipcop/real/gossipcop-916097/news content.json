He was 76.\n\nWilson\u2019s rep Dominic Mancini confirmed the news to PEOPLE Saturday evening. \u201cScott was one of the most genuine, inspirational, and truly beloved people,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cHis amazing legacy will live on through his timeless performances. He will be missed deeply by his wife, family, and friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cScott will always be remembered as a great actor and we all feel fortunate to have known him as an even better person,\u201d AMC said in a statement. \u201cThe character he embodied on The Walking Dead, Hershel, lived at the emotional core of the show. Like Scott in our lives, Hershel was a character whose actions continue to inform our characters\u2019 choices to this day. Our hearts go out to his wife, family, friends and to the millions of fans who loved him. Scott will be missed.\u201d\n\nThe news of Wilson\u2019s death came within hours of the New York Comic-Con announcement that he would be reprising his role as Hershel Greene during the first half of The Walking Dead\u2018s ninth season, which kicks off this Sunday. It will be one of his final onscreen performances.\n\nWilson is survived by his wife, Heavenly, whom he married in 1977.\n\nJamie McCarthy/Getty Images for AMC\n\nWilson had a long career before appearing as Herschel Greene during the second season of The Walking Dead and becoming one of the show\u2019s most beloved characters to date.\n\nBorn in Georgia in 1942, Wilson made his onscreen debut in 1967\u2019s In the Heat of the Night and followed it up later that year with the role of real-life murderer Dick Hickock in an adaptation of Truman Capote\u2019s In Cold Blood. He played George Wilson opposite Robert Redford in 1974\u2019s The Great Gatsby and earned a Golden Globe nomination in 1980 for his turn in The Ninth Configuration.\n\nWilson also made memorable recurring appearances on CSI as Sam Braun, the father of Marg Helgenberger\u2019s Catherine Willows, and followed his time on The Walking Dead with roles on Bosch and The OA.\n\nA number of Wilson\u2019s costars shared their thoughts and memories of him following the news of his death Saturday evening.\n\n\u201cThe first time I met Scott Wilson, he gave me a big hug and said that this thing I had become apart of\u2026 was a family,\u201d wrote TWD\u2018s Khary Payton on Twitter. \u201cHe said I had a responsibility to take care of it. I have tried very hard to do that, sir. & I will continue. I promise. See you on the other side, my friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cScott Wilson has departed. I am heartbroken. We are fewer. Go easy into the light brother,\u201d wrote Bosch\u2018s Titus Welliver.\n\n\u201cI just heard the news about the passing of #ScottWilson,\u201d Yvette Nicole Brown said on Twitter. \u201cHe was a wonderful man and I am heartbroken. #RIP #Hershel #TWD\u201d\n\n\u201cScott Wilson was simply the finest actor and more importantly the finest and most decent man I ever knew. A Noble actor and my dear friend,\u201d wrote Rob Schneider. \u201cScott Wilson had the best lady to share his life, Heavenly Wilson. My heartfelt condolences to her & to all of Scott\u2019s friends the world over.\u201d\n\nSee a few others below:\n\nThe official Twitter account for The Walking Dead comic book, upon which the AMC show is based, posted, \u201cWe are deeply saddened to report that Scott Wilson, the incredible actor who played Hershel on #TheWalkingDead, has passed away at the age of 76,\u201d the statement read. \u201cOur thoughts are with his family and friends. Rest in paradise, Scott. We love you.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/ITz5ouOgoEFc0I9fvs20HP2LPhw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(993x444:995x446)/Honor-Treat-Williams-01-061323-66e1fecb5b6e4db5b5eab19bbb23243c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rVTFhll-uPvmXc1rj8G_xbBheXo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/julian-sands-confirmed-dead-062723-tout-9c6794f947674cf9b04c30e5a7b6c0de.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/GeJ-txssA1G3Dp5ToKHCwVFm5mY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kirstie-alley-regretted-wearing-bikini-on-oprah-120622-5b5f6b1cfd244a668c463946e06840a7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9AgSVUlu_zs_nKFJtXe0e5N8Jqo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(479x299:481x301)/Sterling-K-Brown-and-Ryan-Michelle-Bathe_01-ca8b3a033b8f4669a6ab5e4d68c93b08.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tK4t7agDEtc0PwV7Dp0_aHXptIE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(739x199:741x201)/Erika-Slezak-and-Andrea-Evans-071123-split-29bf6feaace94912b7d093608131d71d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zhUKjYUylPy2KOM6pV8F34RWc4c=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1159x532:1161x534)/Dame-Edna-Everage-Barry-Humphries-04222301-03-2000-5a56621e3658422097e9e401ff4710c4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/eGONJop0hcxA7BZeZqrIoQFdKM4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x309:736x311)/sara-jessica-parker-735f0bfa9b404e788c3070d0a1e1c9f6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zbidHS26UlSV2JavtPJ059bODDk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x385:961x387)/jeffrey-dean-morgan-2000-c230db8573774654a51c48ee37a1472c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KVzoDEJKYU1bVfYth4i4NWmr4L8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Matthew-Perry-Suzanne-Somers-and-Tina-Turner-102328-11baa36c760b4d78a4bd6cdede408166.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/c_N8k2r493Csu_korNIiYidgNag=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1215x570:1217x572)/Lew-Palter-titanic-062723-02-cfd283e9caf64c8c8b209775bfefc6e0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/sYkoXit_J9B5xYCRjFYN0tuddgY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(624x334:626x336)/Treat-Williams-02-061223-42621247a61d4e19adedac48a2ef4c48.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/xj8Tsiwed147CeiiiG1i-hLYC94=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/gettyimages-492065734-2000-c1944305bfd74171a18b66202817c894.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/CZDWBzN09QiCJpsqX9F4HRCPhog=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/gettyimages-492090830-1-2000-02e1aac653804677a1aad42f2d152bda.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4x5sMcTHE0hoYqJHQT9UBj-QOiY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(753x253:755x255)/Jeffrey-Carlson-070923-1-b1739fee8dbe4d75b527d89efbe33efd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/eLoVSv8O1rbv5ssLqPlABJC0vv0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1153x317:1155x319)/what-comes-around-3-tout-071023-05c844a0cb20410685dba0e0fad93a53.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/VHP7Vq0ETLTBMlpTyHZhSG2WBxk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x474:1021x476)/barbie-movie-cast-f90494bea2a84dcbbc99a1f663538456.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/JoSxk_mOhZljI8VtcizHBBqmb30=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/brett-hadley-dead-at-92-061623-tout-21d8aa910f31458c9e2ee13ea1076452.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/g3jyEc_e3ugzRCIHoWaKl27W_r8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x569:1021x571)/robert-redford-kids-1-93b6d773e5db46c0ba0fd5ac66883ecb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/xj8Tsiwed147CeiiiG1i-hLYC94=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/gettyimages-492065734-2000-c1944305bfd74171a18b66202817c894.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Breanne L.
