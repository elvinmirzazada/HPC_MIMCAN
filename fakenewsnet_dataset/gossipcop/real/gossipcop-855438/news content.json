In 2002, the entire cast stopped to pay homage to Will Ferrell. When Andy Samberg and Kristen Wiig left the show in 2012, it was Wiig alone who got a massive, emotional farewell featuring Mick Jagger. (According to Lorne Michaels, Samberg and wasn\u2019t quite sure about his departures at the time.) And in addition to their tearful farewells at the end of their episodes in 2013, Bill Hader and Fred Armisen each got goodbye sketches tailored to their particular tastes\u2014a star-studded Stefon wedding for Hader and a musical-star-studded number for Armisen. And in 2014, a departing Seth Meyers was greeted by ghosts of \u201cWeekend Update\u201d past as he gave his final news report mid-season.\n\nYou could argue that Bayer, Moynihan, and certainly the under-used Zamata were never S.N.L. stars the way Ferrell, Wiig, Hader, Armisen, and Meyers were. They\u2019re more on-par with the likes of Rachel Dratch, Chris Parnell, and Horatio Sanz who were all cut\u2014without any on-air ado\u2014for budgetary reasons in 2006. \u201cIt still stung a little because you don\u2019t ever want to be let go,\u201d Parnell told Vulture years later. \u201cI was a little burnt out, so it was all right.\u201d\n\nBut what\u2019s also true about this new, well-watched era of Saturday Night Live is that the likes of Moynihan, Bayer, and Zamata have even less of a chance than they did before of breaking out the way stars of S.N.L. past did. S.N.L. hit ratings and critical gold this year by leaning heavily on Baldwin and Melissa McCarthy to recur in their show-stopping sketches. Baldwin joked during The Rock\u2019s monologue this week, \u201cWhat a season this has been. . .for me . . .I can\u2019t take all the credit. What do you call those pale people who take the subway?\u201d \u201cThe writers,\u201d Johnson joked back. It was a funny acknowledgment of the excessive attention Baldwin has received, but the joke landed so well because it\u2019s rooted in the truth that, even more than usual, the S.N.L. cast felt like supporting players this year. When The Rock\u2019s episode of S.N.L. ended on the West Coast this week, an old re-run with Jim Carrey and, fittingly, Soundgarden, it was a shock to see the political cold open featuring Bob Dole, Ted Koppel, and Bill Clinton played entirely by existing cast members Darrell Hammond (doing double duty) and Norm McDonald. It\u2019s easy to forget that, no pun intended, that was once the norm.\n\nThat shift of focus to celebrity guest stars became apparent in a recent Hollywood Reporter cover story when producer Steve Higgins said that after Baldwin was hired, he felt bad for \u201cpoor Darrell [Hammond],\u201d who came out of S.N.L. retirement to replace Don Pardo as the show\u2019s announcer in 2014, and played Trump for much of 2016. And writer Kent Sublette points out that if Melissa McCarthy hadn\u2019t been tapped to play Sean Spicer, \u201cit would have gone to Beck [Bennett]. He has an amazing impression. In fact, he reads Spicer for the read-through because Melissa\u2019s not usually there.\u201d With the exception of Kate McKinnon and, I\u2019d argue, Kenen Thompson (by sheer dint of endurance), the S.N.L. talent isn\u2019t rising up the ranks the way it once did. Even Leslie Jones\u2014who has certainly become a household name\u2014owes most of her fame to her own hustle outside of S.N.L. on social media and in last year\u2019s Ghostbusters. Like Zamata, she\u2019s rarely well-deployed in sketches.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921cbf90e4c8010bd72d184/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-05-21%2520at%252010.17.49%2520AM.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655ccc3505c13bc519c0d468/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6516f18d66eef8a3c2f54d57/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921c7f01165e3156f47072c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/bill-fred.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660159ee60bb2d438ba5ff/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921d8960e4c8010bd72d186/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sasheer-zamata-snl.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921137b256b331b4fda52e8/1:1/pass/the-rock-tom-hanks-snl-president.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59210ecd0e4c8010bd72d179/1:1/pass/snl-trump-hallelujah.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655a32d089a252861df9a909/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921cbf924f98714583f1955/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-05-21%2520at%252010.17.32%2520AM.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/656510d0affa7b4408631071/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921159c1165e3156f470724/1:1/pass/tom-hanks-david-pumpkins.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54db9137816608815fd00dca/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/saturday-night-live-anniversary-ss01.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6543bf1ecfc2a4411ada29a7/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655265a8fdcd5122e9d20d17/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6564cb9e766ac2eb76f98953/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54db915e8a2fdf64645fe020/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/saturday-night-live-anniversary-ss02.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655537dac3da6036ef99c5ea/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54db92758d77134d68d3bb6a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/saturday-night-live-anniversary-ss03.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921d8960e4c8010bd72d186/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/sasheer-zamata-snl.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65454a17104eba27bc0ffd3d/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5921d8960e4c8010bd72d186/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sasheer-zamata-snl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Joanna Robinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/sasheer-zamata-snl-leaving-bobby-moynihan-vanessa-bayer", "title": "Why Did a Third S.N.L.
