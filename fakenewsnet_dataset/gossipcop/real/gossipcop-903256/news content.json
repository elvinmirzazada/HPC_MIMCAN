Whether you\u2019re someone who loves to get dressed up in a gown or chic suit or you prefer to stay home in jeans and a tee, you\u2019ll feel like a formalwear pro after perusing our little guide. Though some of the terms might come from traditions that we don\u2019t necessarily adhere to anymore, there are still ways to follow them so you\u2019re dressed appropriately\u2014no matter your personal style.\n\nSo next time you get a fancy invitation in the mail with the words \u201cblack-tie formal\u201d printed on it, you\u2019ll know exactly what to wear. Keep reading to learn what black-tie formal really means, whether or not some etiquette rules still hold up and everything else there is to know about dressing for a formal event.

Originally, when an event was black-tie formal, it meant that men should wear tuxedos. Of course anyone\u2014no matter their gender identity\u2014can wear a suit or a dress, so the functionalities of the term are a little different. We\u2019ll get into the details below.\n\nGown Or No Gown: Do I Have An Option?\n\nApart from white-tie affairs\u2014which aren\u2019t common\u2014black tie is the most formal dress code you\u2019ll probably face when to comes to weddings or galas. For those who wish to wear a dress, it\u2019s customary to wear floor-length gowns, though exceptions can be made.\n\nDon\u2019t own a gown and don\u2019t particularly want to buy one for a one-off occasion? It\u2019s perfectly acceptable to wear a cocktail dress you already have. However, if you do go this route, just make sure to keep the colors rich (black, jewel tones, chic metallics, brown) so as not to look too casual. Conversely, you can wear a floor-length gown in a lighter shade, since the silhouette is inherently dressy.\n\nAnother acceptable option for black-tie affairs: Chic separates, such as a silk blouse with a full satin skirt or an elevated suit (if you\u2019d rather skip the tuxedo), work too.\n\nLascana Pleated V-Neck Dress\n\nYou\u2019ll easily be the star of the night in this baby blue pleated v-neck dress. It also happens to be on sale right as we speak.\n\nLascana Printed V-Neck Maxi Dress\n\nA more casual take on gowns (if dressing to the nines isn\u2019t your thing), this Lascana maxi dress is just as elegant as it is comfortable.\n\nFreya Satin Charmeuse Dress This rust-colored gown from BHLDN comes in six neutral hues and is technically a bridesmaid\u2019s dress, but it totally works as a guest\u2019s dress, too! Freya Satin Charmeuse Dress $80+ Buy Now\n\nBlack Tie Optional: What It Means\n\nIf you receive an invite with the term \u201cblack tie optional\u201d know that it mostly applies to folks (typically, but definitely not limited to, men) who may or may not own or want to wear a tuxedo. For those who prefer dresses, it means you have the option of wearing a full-length gown, or choosing a cocktail dress\u2014so long as the style is relatively conservative. This often means that longer hemlines are preferred and long slits are not. Essentially, if you choose to wear a shorter or cocktail dress, make sure it\u2019ll hold up in a room full of formal tuxedos and gowns.\n\nWearing Red To A Formal Affair: What\u2019s The Deal?\n\nThis dated fashion rule was originally put into place during more conservative times when red was thought to be a way-too-sexy, attention-stealing color. Sure, you might want to stay away from wearing a skin-tight red plunging spandex gown to a wedding or black-tie affair, but in this case, the color isn\u2019t the reason why. These days, there are plenty of high-style red dresses that are perfectly acceptable as formal wear. Celebrities often wear red gowns that look elegant and classic, so go ahead and don a red hot look yourself.\n\nA good rule of thumb: Choose red gowns that are made from rich silky fabrics like chiffon or organza, as opposed to shiny satin or anything too stretchy and always keep embellishments to a minimum.\n\nNBD Maracuya Gown\n\nThere\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t show a little leg, especially if it\u2019s in this stunning gown from NBD.\n\nNiall Midi Dress\n\nYes, cut-outs can work for a black-tie event. This Niall Midi Dress from h:ours is proof! It keeps its formal vibe thanks to the knee-length hemline.\n\nWearing White To A Wedding: Yes or No?\n\nDespite the fact that etiquette books say it\u2019s perfectly fine to wear a white dress to someone else\u2019s wedding so long as it\u2019s not overtly \u201cbridal,\u201d we say proceed with caution. It\u2019s become a pretty big no-no in modern times and you could run the risk of offending the bride\u2014even if it\u2019s a given that you won\u2019t take away any of her attention. Since most folks are usually clued into the fact that wearing white is a don\u2019t, it might look like you made a conscious effort to cause some drama.\n\nYour best bet: Save that ethereal white gown for another formal event that\u2019s not a wedding.\n\nCovering Up: Jackets, Coats & More\n\nSince several formal events take place in colder weather, you\u2019ll need something to keep you warm. However, leave those cardigans, denim jackets and everyday puffers at home and invest in a fur (or faux-fur) jacket or classic overcoat and a chic shawl or cashmere wrap in case you get chilly inside, or for spring and summer affairs.\n\nAdrienne Landau Faux Fox Fur Short Jacket\n\nNow\u2019s the perfect opportunity to go a little bold with your outdoor wear; this faux fox jacket will complement any grown or dress you wear underneath.\n\nBelted Double Face Wool Blend Wrap Coat Why would you need a basic black or brown coat when you could wear this light blue option from Bernardo?

Is it acceptable to change into jeans, or is keeping your formal wear on a must? This really depends on the location of the wedding. For example, if your hotel room is easily accessible, a lot of people do change. But if it\u2019s another venue, most people won\u2019t. Feel out the situation to see what others are doing\u2014you certainly don\u2019t want to be the only one in jeans when others are still wearing gowns.\n\nLascana Asymmetrical Hem Dress\n\nThis asymmetrical hem dress will be perfect for any post-event gatherings.\n\nA version of this article was originally published in March 2016.", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetabercrombiejeans.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/revolve-fuzzy-cover-up.jpg?w=650", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/formal-gowns-ref-.jpeg?w=503", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-clothing-sales-right-now-2.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/perrie-samotin1.jpg?w=256&h=256&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lacana-blue-dress.jpg?w=650", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/irrational-found-renewed-season-2-nbc.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/formal-gowns-bhldn-.jpeg?w=405", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/formal-gowns-bernardo-.jpeg?w=437", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/alo-yoga-black-friday-sale.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetsweaterset.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/root-cover-up-fi.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/daisy-jones-and-the-six.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RemiBader_Homepage.webp?w=244", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/black-tie-formal-wear.jpg", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/revolve-red-dress.jpg?w=650", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nativaspa-cyber-monday.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://spy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sdfgve.png?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lascana-pink.jpg?w=650", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ulta-hair-sale.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/formal-gowns-revolve-.png?w=366", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uggdupestarget.gif?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/target-sweater.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/best-womens-winter-boots.png?w=960&h=580&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/black-tie-formal-wear.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/city-chic-.jpeg?w=437", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/olivercabellsneakersale.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cariuma-oca-therma-black.png?w=960&h=580&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ChatGPT.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bestprodsforthinninghair.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-Masked-Singer-10-episode-8.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lascana-hot-pink.jpg?w=650", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/formal-gowns-la-femme-.jpeg?w=437", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mean-girls.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MS-S10_VTR10-Show-TP_00142_f.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/holidaydresses.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/black-tie-formal-wear.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Perrie Samotin"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/feature/black-tie-formal-wear-225061/", "title": "Black Tie Formal Wear: What It Means, What To Wear & More", "meta_data": {"description": "Check out a list of do's and don'ts that explain the basics of black tie formal wear.
