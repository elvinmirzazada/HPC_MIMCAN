The couple are already parents to three daughters, Olivia, 7, Annabel Leah, 4, and Emilia, 2, as well as son Joshua, 6.\n\n\"Thrilled to announce we welcomed a brand new baby girl into the world Friday morning, just in time for #FathersDay ?\" Van Der Beek wrote. \"These last few days, as I\u2019ve enjoyed the privilege of making smoothies I know my older kids will like, making my wife red raspberry leaf tea to ease her uterine contractions, spending 'boy time' with my son and getting my two year-old down for a nap in the way only I know how... I\u2019ve been heart sick about something.\"\n\nThe former Dawson's Creek star then went on to criticize the Donald Trump Administration's crack down on illegal immigration with a zero-tolerance policy of separating families at the border.\n\n\"As I write this, kids are being ripped from the arms of their parents. By our government. For the kid\u2019s benefit? No - the opposite - as a purposeful display of cruelty to deter would-be illegal border crossers AND legal asylum seekers (it\u2019s happening to both). And it wouldn\u2019t be honest to wax poetic about my new-baby bliss without speaking up against this atrocity,\" Van Der Beek wrote.\n\nHe concluded with a sweet message to his wife, Kimberly.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, and @vanderkimberly -- you\u2019re a f*cking earth goddess rock star and I\u2019m as in awe of you as I am in love with you,\" he wrote. \"And our new baby\u2019s name is Gwendolyn \u2764\ufe0f #HappyFathersDay everybody.\"\n\nThe couple announced that they were expanding their brood back in February, with a sweet shot of the family crowded around Kimberly's baby bump.\n\n\"Thrilled beyond belief to announce that we are once again adding to our family ?,\" James captioned the pic. \"And I say 'beyond belief' because some people are probably wondering if we\u2019re out of our minds. Which we might very well be... but I couldn\u2019t be more excited. Or grateful. Or in awe of @vanderkimberly.\"\n\nHowever, the couple were also realistic about being way outnumbered by their growing family. Prior to welcoming their fifth child, James posted a pic of their kids on a sweet farm outing, with the knowing caption, \"In a few weeks, we\u2019ll look back on today and think, 'Boy, wasn\u2019t that easy?'\"\n\nSee more on the sweet family in the video below!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fslides%2F129998%2Fdawsons-creek640.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2F1280_james_van_der_beek_gettyimages-852076834.jpg%3Fh%3D06010c5c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-03%2Fdawsons_creek_gettyimages-826232.jpg%3Fh%3D0a15848f&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-06%2Fgettyimages-959727646.jpg%3Fh%3D2edfd7e6&w=1024&q=100", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2019-01/kanye-kim-gettyimages-1077003424_0.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/gettyimages-959727646.jpg?h=2edfd7e6"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/gettyimages-959727646.jpg?h=2edfd7e6", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/james-van-der-beek-and-wife-kimberly-welcome-baby-no-5-104160", "title": "James Van Der Beek and Wife Kimberly Welcome Baby No. 5!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/gettyimages-959727646.jpg?h=2edfd7e6", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 'Dawson's Creek' star and his wife are now a family of seven!", "title": "James Van Der Beek and Wife Kimberly Welcome Baby No. 5!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/james-van-der-beek-and-wife-kimberly-welcome-baby-no-5-104160", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 'Dawson's Creek' star and his wife are now a family of seven!", "twitter": {"description": "The 'Dawson's Creek' star and his wife are now a family of seven!", "title": "James Van Der Beek and Wife Kimberly Welcome Baby No. 5!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/james-van-der-beek-and-wife-kimberly-welcome-baby-no-5-104160", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/gettyimages-959727646.jpg?h=2edfd7e6", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "James Van Der Beek and Wife Kimberly Welcome Baby No. 5! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Births, Babies & Kids, James Van Der Beek", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
