Turns out, Teigen was making banana bread for her second cookbook, Cravings: Hungry For More. The sequel came out on the 18th and does not disappoint. In it, you\u2019ll find more of Teigen\u2019s mom Pepper\u2019s Thai recipes, bahn mi sandwiches I want to make every day for the rest of my life, yummy potato dishes with names like Crispy Potato Smashies (Smashies! I die!), and so much more. But most importantly, you\u2019ll find her now iconic banana bread recipe called Twitter\u2019s (and Uncle Mike\u2019s) Banana Bread. Which I decided to make on Yom Kippur, no less (meaning: I couldn\u2019t actually eat it until sundown, torture!).\n\nThis banana bread is unlike any other kind of banana bread I\u2019ve made. And, fun fact, I\u2019ve made a lot of banana bread. Usually I stick to the classic recipes (bananas, flour, cinnamon, some sugar, blah, blah), so when I read through Teigen\u2019s recipe, I was rattled. It called for the aforementioned six brown bananas, vanilla instant pudding mix, shredded coconut, dark chocolate chunks, and no spices. \u201cYou guys, Chrissy\u2019s banana bread doesn\u2019t call for cinnamon and I\u2019m nervous,\u201d I wrote in my So Yummy editorial group chat. I fought against the deep, deep urge to throw in the tiniest dash of cinnamon, but ultimately followed the recipe exactly the way Teigen intended it to be followed.\n\nFirst of all, you definitely do need six bananas, so don\u2019t cheap out and only get five.\n\nTeigen writes, \u201cYou will think you only need five because it looks like enough, but it will not be enough.\u201d It\u2019s true. Six mashed-up bananas was slightly too much, but if I only mashed five bananas, I would have come up short. Also: Teigen means it when she says BROWN bananas. I confess that I couldn\u2019t wait for my bananas to completely wilt into into complete darkness \u2014 they were intensely spotted and still very, very sweet and easy to mash, though. If I were to do this over again, I would summon the patience to actually wait for those bananas to reach their browniest-brown potential.\n\nAnother tweak: I don\u2019t own a bundt pan (nothing personal against bundt cakes, I just don\u2019t like baking them), so I had to bake the bread in two separate 8 x 4-inch loaf pans. Which is fine, because I figured I\u2019d probably screw up the first time around, and having a practice round made me feel safe. (Teigen prefers the bundt pan because she says the bread comes out more moist, but to be honest, the loaf pan did just fine!) In the directions, Teigen says to bake for 55 minutes to an hour \u2014 both of mine took a little over an hour. I set the timer for each one for 45 minutes, would check on it, tack on another 10 minutes, check again \u2014 basically until I felt confident that the banana bread was fully baked and my toothpicks came out clean. (Full disclosure: my oven is off by 15 degrees, so take all of that with a grain of sea salt.)\n\nThe results? OMFG, screw my banana bread with cinnamon.\n\nThis banana bread tastes more like a cake than a bread, so maybe this recipe isn\u2019t for you if you feel like banana bread should feel more like a fruit serving. It\u2019s sweet, the coconut adds texture and complexity, the vanilla instant pudding adds fluff, and the chocolate just takes it over. The. Edge. Neither ingredient is overpowering, which can be tricky when you\u2019re making dessert with such a distinct flavor profile. In fact, I\u2019m going to go ahead and say this is the best banana bread I\u2019ve ever had \u2014 and the So Yummy editorial office all agrees.\n\nSlather some whipped butter on top, vanilla bean ice cream, or eat it plain. For breakfast the next day, toast it and pair it with a cup of coffee and know that life is pretty good.\n\nYou can get Chrissy Teigen\u2019s new cookbook Cravings: Hungry For More on Amazon for $17.99!", "images": ["https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/elementor/thumbs/banana-bread-qfe9s1u1lcquk8igxgmn3hdkj6f64z03oemz5osvrk.jpeg", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/banana-bread.jpeg", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-224.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20480%20223'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/banana-bread-2.jpeg", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Layer_1-13.svg", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/giphy.gif", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/tia-mowry-diet-e1569867159952.jpg", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/banana-bread-1024x838.jpeg", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/chocolate.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20151%2036'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20270%20155'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/mashed-bananas.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20318%202'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20331'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-5qChdFqUsnFRc.gif", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mobile-Logo@3x-min.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/anna-nicole-smith-diet.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/14bfad7ca005889295958986e366aa7b?s=300&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=794665905883259&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201080%20591'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201796%201328'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dough.jpg", "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Vector-459.svg"], "top_img": "https://soyummy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/banana-bread.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Vaynshteyn", "Gina Vaynshteyn Is The Editor In Chief At First Media.
