The actor plays Ronnie, a junkie who befriends Andrew Cunanan (Darren Criss) and is unaware that his new acquaintance is a wanted serial killer.\n\nIn only a handful of scenes, Greenfield creates a full-bodied tragic character \u2014 even Ronnie\u2019s walk feels specific and thoughtful. The actor previously worked with executive producer Ryan Murphy on American Horror Story: Hotel, which also found the actor exploring a much darker side than New Girl fans were used to seeing.\n\nEW talked to Greenfield about reuniting with Murphy, crafting his Versace character, and, naturally, Darren Criss\u2019 pink Speedo.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Was this just the case of Ryan Murphy calling you up and asking you to do this role? How did this come about?\n\nMAX GREENFIELD: Ryan and I keep in touch. He knew that I had finished New Girl, and he knew I was off. We ran into each other and he was like, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, man.\u201d I think I had wrapped that week. He goes, \u201cI wanna show you a couple of things.\u201d And this happened to be one of the things he showed me. He sent me the first two scripts. I went off and looked at it, and I thought it was incredible. I didn\u2019t know that I could do it. I\u2019m certainly not the person that you think of when you would read this on paper. Like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a no-brainer!\u201d\n\nSo I put myself on tape for it. I wanted to see if I could do it, and I got to a place where I felt like, \u201cOh, now I sorta love this guy!\u201d I sent Ryan the tape and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is any good, but this is what it would look like.\u201d Two and a half weeks later, I was in Miami.\n\nPari Dukovic/FX\n\nDid you lose weight? You look much skinnier, or maybe that was just your psychical performance.\n\nIt was probably a little bit of both. The previous summer I had done The Glass Castle, which was a great experience. But I was supposed to have an arm-wrestling match with Woody Harrelson in the movie. The one note from the director was, \u201cHey, man, this is a big scene in the movie. I know you\u2019re like a fit guy. Can you not work out as much?\u201d I was like, \u201cI will not touch another weight.\u201d And I didn\u2019t for like a long time, and I ended up losing a lot of size. On New Girl, I\u2019m always like in cardigans, and I just don\u2019t think it really played. But in this, mixed with the fact that I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, in two weeks I\u2019m going to be in Miami? I don\u2019t have to eat I guess.\u201d But I also think it was the physicality and the buzz cut and the whole thing.\n\nWhat was it about Ronnie that you responded to?\n\nWhat I really loved about him and what I found so heartbreaking about him \u2026 I knew he was based on a real guy, but I knew physically we didn\u2019t resemble one another. What I found so heartbreaking about him, and as I started to research the period of the time, but I knew a little bit about \u2014 it\u2019s funny when you research something as an actor, you might know about that period of time. But when you\u2019re then asked to come at it from a place of, I\u2019m going to have to play this person, really understanding what 1997 and that the period around that meant for somebody in the LGBT community who has HIV, and the idea that a year and a half earlier they had figured out the correct medication to give patients who had accepted over the past 15-plus years that they were going to die! They watched everybody else around them die \u2014 how on earth would it be any different? You hear people who are still living with HIV who lived through that time to this day talk about the fact that they still have difficulty wrapping their head around that tomorrow isn\u2019t going to be my last day? Or this isn\u2019t going to turn on me?\n\nBut what I also loved about Ronnie and what he represented is you can see through Ryan\u2019s other work and Larry Kramer\u2019s work, these people from the ACT UP movement who were like taking it head on. But you never saw the people who gave into it and didn\u2019t fight and just thought, \u201cThis is my fate and this is what I deserve.\u201d And I think Ronnie was one of those people, and it broke my heart. I thought, \u201cI love this guy.\u201d\n\nDid you find any comparisons between Ronnie and Gabriel, the character you played on AHS: Hotel?\n\nI think in the sense maybe that these are two guys who were lost. Totally lost.\n\nHow as it working with Darren?\n\nIt was really great. It was intense. As heartbreaking as Ronnie was, part of that heartbreak was his relationship with Andrew and the fact that he was enamored by this guy, and also sort of thinking he had made a friend. He was so alone and thought this was a guy who came to Miami for the same reasons he had. Watching him sort of try to keep up with Andrew and carry on a normal conversation with him like friends might do and listen to this guy who was so all over the place. The humor of that is not lost on me. I mean, there is an element of like, man, this is an odd couple!\n\nWhat was it like when Darren emerged from the bathroom with duct tape on his face?\n\nThe nice thing of a scene like that is they\u2019re not very hard to play! If you\u2019re in character and the scene is \u201cBe freaked out by the guy who walks out of the bathroom with his head wrapped in duct tape,\u201d I\u2019d love to say I\u2019m an incredible actor, but at that point it\u2019s not that hard.\n\nYou also have to spend a fair amount of time staring at Darren in a pink Speedo; was that an odd day at work?\n\nThat is so par for the course on a Ryan show. Honestly, it couldn\u2019t be less weird.\n\nI guess you did previously yank Naomi Campbell through a bed on Hotel.\n\n[The beach scene] was honestly one of the more casual days I\u2019ve ever had on a Ryan set [laughs].\n\nWhy do you and Ryan work so well together?\n\nUm, it\u2019s not me. There\u2019s a couple factors: I really love Ryan. I love what he does. He has set the bar so high for performances on his projects that if you don\u2019t come prepared and ready to go, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re there. That to me is all I wanna do.\n\nThen, there\u2019s the fun idea, which is like to surprise or excite Ryan, which is really hard to do.\n\nThe third thing, and this really is why it works out so well, is because the people that work for Ryan, his department heads, these people are so astronomically good at their job. If you utilize them as an actor under the umbrella of what Ryan has given us all for who this character is, the next thing you know you have the right clothes on, you have the earring, your hands are dirty, your head is shaved, you have the right mustache. Everything is just right, and you then don\u2019t have to work that hard. To me I think the reason why I\u2019ve been really happy and satisfied and why I think they\u2019ve been successful collaborations is because of the people he surrounds himself with. They\u2019re so good.\n\nNow that New Girl is ending, would you want to be on a Ryan Murphy series?\n\nLook, Ryan is one of those people if I saw his number pop up on my phone, I\u2019d say, \u201cI\u2019ll be at Fox in five minutes.\u201d\n\nWhat can you say about the finale of New Girl?\n\nWhat I love about the season and the way we wrap it up is I equate it to like a rock musician who plays a rock concert and goes, \u201cYou know what, you guys? Tonight I\u2019m playing the hits! We\u2019re just gonna play all the songs you love.\u201d I love that they did that. I love what Liz [Meriwether] and the rest of the writers did. I think it\u2019s a real love letter to the fans. It\u2019s all of the greatest hits from seven seasons.\n\nThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on FX. New Girl returns for its final season April 10 at 9:30 p.m. ET on Fox.", "images":
