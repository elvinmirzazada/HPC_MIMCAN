And we\u2019re not going to stop until they can sing them to their kids again.\u201d\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda is singing a lullaby for children separated from their parents pic.twitter.com/csctFNjR5T \u2014 Meg Wagner (@megwagner) June 30, 2018", "images": ["https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/024/5b2/ed23e05210e1edbe7981cfd6afb86de6f3-australia-show-11-27-2023-lede.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31f/3f9/e831d4603996ae311f04bcb3bd807b0588-02-lin-manuel-miranda.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/432/78a/817556d5a1a5ab358af1dca2d79eccaaae-Le-French-Diner-Matt-Morris.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31f/3f9/e831d4603996ae311f04bcb3bd807b0588-02-lin-manuel-miranda.rsquare.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/20b/fd3/7226659559afbbe7df4da2aa60aadbe3cd-my-brothers-ghost.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2e2/98e/99818d3d7a6a16d9c4b41dca7a9760ec10-2423Cov-4x5-CONFLICT.w240.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31f/3f9/e831d4603996ae311f04bcb3bd807b0588-02-lin-manuel-miranda.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/lin-manuel-miranda-sings-hamilton-lullaby-at-families-march.html", "title": "Lin-Manuel Miranda Sings Hamilton Lullaby at Families March", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "lin manuel miranda, immigration policy, family separation policy, protests, music, families belong together march, immigration, family separation, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Lin-Manuel Miranda Sings Hamilton Lullaby at Families Belong Together Protest", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/lin-manuel-miranda-sings-hamilton-lullaby-at-families-march.html", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re here because there\u2019s parents right now who can\u2019t sing lullabies to their kids,\u201d he told protesters. \u201cThis is for those parents.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31f/3f9/e831d4603996ae311f04bcb3bd807b0588-02-lin-manuel-miranda.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Lin-Manuel Miranda Sings Hamilton Lullaby at Families March", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re here because there\u2019s parents right now who can\u2019t sing lullabies to their kids,\u201d he told protesters. \u201cThis is for those parents.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31f/3f9/e831d4603996ae311f04bcb3bd807b0588-02-lin-manuel-miranda.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hallekiefer", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-30T23:07:03.285-04:00", "tag": "lin manuel miranda, immigration policy, family separation policy, protests, music, families belong together march, immigration, family separation", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Lin-Manuel Miranda sang Hamilton\u2019s \u201cDear Theodosia\u201d at Saturday\u2019s Families Belong Together protest March in honor of separated families.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "lin manuel miranda, immigration policy, family separation policy, protests, music, families belong together march, immigration, family separation", "author": "Halle Kiefer", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "sectionOverride": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.vulture.com/media/sites/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530414423.285, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
