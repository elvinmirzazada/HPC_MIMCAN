I just gave Rob Kardashian notice that we'll be in court Monday seeking restraining orders against him. More to come.'\n\nLater on in the day, Chyna was seen for the first time since the announcement while out with her and Kardashian's seven-month-old daughter Dream in Los Angeles.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nOuch: Blac Chyna will be seeking a restraining order against Rob Kardashian after his social media tirade it was revealed on Friday\n\nMoving forward: The 29-year-old model was seen for the first time since the announcement while out with her and Kardashian's seven-month-old daughter Dream in Los Angeles\n\nLegal action: American civil rights attorney Lisa Bloom wrote that she represents Chyna and will be in court seeking restraining orders on Monday in this tweet\n\nShe also posted an adorable Snapchat video which showed Dream in a pink onesie.\n\nThe infant then proceeds to sway to repeated calls of 'Go Dream!'\n\nBloom is a veteran lawyer who recently claimed legal victory in the Mischa Barton 'revenge porn' scandal and has previously filed sexual abuse suits against the Roman Catholic Church and multiple cases against the LAPD.\n\nCute! She also posted an adorable Snapchat video which showed Dream in a pink onesie\n\nDancing up a storm! The infant then proceeds to sway to repeated calls of 'Go Dream!'\n\nShortly after the announcement TMZ reported that they obtained legal documents in which Chyna detailed a violent incident with Rob.\n\nAccording to the gossip site, back in April Kardashian was upset at her and began saying upsetting things in front of her son King Cairo and when Chyna asked him to stop he allegedly replied: 'I can say whatever the f*** I want!'\n\nShe goes on to claim that he grabbed her phone, shoved her to the ground, and followed with 'aggressively shoving me by the side of my arm and hitting me on the thigh.'\n\nExplicit: The Kardashian star posted this explicit photo of the mother-of-two while claiming she slept with another man shortly after sending him the image\n\nClaims: In a since-deleted Snapchat post, Chyna claimed that Rob had beat her up but details have emerged of an incident according to legal documents obtained by TMZ on Friday\n\nChyna then claimed she fell to the ground, was bruised up, and could barely walk.\n\nThe Lashed entrepreneur added that this wasn't the first incident as she said: 'Rob has been violent with me in the past and I am afraid to be around him.'\n\nIn a since-deleted Snapchat post, Chyna had claimed that Rob had beat her up during his now-infamous tirade on Wednesday.\n\nIn need of some relaxation? Later on in the day China was spotted at a nail salon in Encino\n\nChill: Dream was carried by a friend as Chyna got her nails done\n\nPrimping session: Chyna was dressed down for the occasion\n\nMoving on: After the pamper session, Chyna headed out with her daughter\n\nIn a statement to DailyMail.com on Friday, Bloom targeted Kardashian as she said: 'It stops now. Your attempts to shame and contro, her body are hereby rejected.\n\n'Her body, her choice. Her life, her choice. Back off.'\n\nBloom also said that the 30-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star and Chyna have been broken up for months and that it is up to her client to live however she chooses.\n\nShe added: 'Chyna and I both believe that this is an important women's rights issue, as many women and girls have been slut-shamed by exes.'\n\nThe lawyer goes as far as calling Rob a 'cyberbully' and that doing it to your ex is harassment.\n\nExperienced: The 55-year-old American civil rights attorney recently claimed legal victory in the Mischa Barton 'revenge porn' scandal as they are pictured together last month\n\nBloom told TMZ that her intentions are to not only help her client but to also send a message to as many people possible that the most common form of harassment and bullying in this day and age happens online and it needs to be put to an end.\n\nDuring Kardashian's now-infamous tirade, Bloom gave a warning to the reality star before even being hired on to represent Chyna.\n\nThe lawyer took to her Twitter on Wednesday to write: 'Note to Rob Kardashian: revenge porn is a crime. And in my Mischa Barton case judge agreed it's a form of domestic violence. Knock it off.'\n\nOut and about: Bloom was spotted in Los Angeles on Friday\n\nMaking moves: It certainly seemed to be a busy day for the civil rights attorney and television legal analyst\n\nDynamic duo: She was joined by a male chum on the day that revelations about Rob and Chyna's relationship were made\n\nCaution: During Kardashian's now-infamous tirade, Bloom gave a warning via tweets on Wednesday to the reality star before even being hired on to represent Chyna\n\nBloom - who practices in both California and New York - famously represented actress Mischa Barton in a scandal earlier this year.\n\nIn March, reports had emerged that a sex tape involving the 31-year-old former star of The OC was being shopped around as Barton responded with a lawsuit against ex Jon Zacharias.\n\nOn June 5, Bloom shared a photo of herself raising Barton's arm with the caption: 'COURT VICTORY today with Mischa Barton. Distribution of the explicit images banned, ex stays 100 yards away forever.'\n\nSeasoned: Bloom - pictured in LA back in June 2015 - has previously filed sexual abuse suits against the Roman Catholic Church and multiple cases against the LAPD\n\n'COURT VICTORY': In March, reports had emerged that a sex tape involving Mischa Barton, 31, was being shopped around as Barton responded with a lawsuit against ex Jon Zacharias\n\nLast month, she joined Kathy Griffin at a press conference in Los Angeles after the 56-year-old comedienne's very controversial 'ISIS-style' photoshoot featuring a bloody prop which resembled Donald Trump's severed head.\n\nThe lawyer is also the only child of legendary civil rights attorney Gloria Allred and Peyton Huddleston Bray, Jr.\n\nBloom is no stranger to showbiz as she was an anchor on her own truTV legal news program Lisa Bloom: Open Court and has been a legal analyst on The Today Show, NBC Nightly News, The Early Show, The Insider, and Dr. Phil.\n\nClientele: Last month, the attorney joined Kathy Griffin at a press conference in Los Angeles after the 56-year-old comedienne's very controversial Donald Trump-centered photoshoot\n\nIt comes after he posted several nude photographs of his on-off girlfriend on Instagram and accused her of cheating on him with eight men in less than a month.\n\nThe bitter online rant on Wednesday sparked a furious response from Chyna who accused Rob of beating her.\n\nTheir feud began when Rob posted an image of his on-again off-again girlfriend wearing no underwear on Instagram Wednesday morning.\n\nHe claims Chyna sent him the picture on July 4 before sleeping with another man.\n\nAccusations: Rob Kardashian shared explicit photos and a video of ex Blac Chyna on Wednesday as he accused her of cheating on him\n\n'This is from Chyna yesterday to me. I never been so disrespected in my life. I just bought her 250K of jewelry yesterday. This woman is so disrespectful and I don't care,' he wrote.\n\nChyna responded to the allegations on Snapchat, claiming in a now-deleted post that Rob physically abused her.\n\n'Rob u did all this but u beat me up and try act it never happen !!!!! U put hand on me I swear on god !!!!! On my kids but I'm supposed to be quiet because you're a Kardashian (sic),' she wrote in the post that has since been deleted.\n\nShe also posted of her showing off a diamond-encrusted watch and bracelets - presumably some of the expensive jewelry Rob claimed to have purchased for her.\n\nRob started his Instagram rant by sharing a video clip of Chyna kissing another man. Chyna is seen on top of the man while kissing him and gazing into the camera.\n\n'Hahahaha Chyna just sent me this video saying happy 4th of July what a crazy person. Come spend time with your daughter instead of f***ing me and then this dude right after. U need help' Rob wrote next to the intimate clip.\n\nPost 1: Rob started his Instagram rampage with a video of Blac Chyna kissing another man\n\nRob could find himself in legal trouble as revenge porn laws are in effect in the state of California, where it is considered a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.\n\nDailyMail.com reached out to the L.A. County Sheriff's Office, but officials there said they hadn't received a report of a crime.\n\nAt first, Rob said that the man kissing Chyna in the clip was a rapper named Rarri True. But Instagram users pointed out to the reality star that the man in the video is actually a musician named Mechie. Rarri True is a Chicago-born rapper. Mechie, 24, from Washington, DC, is described as an R&B singer.\n\nRob later amended his post, but stood by his claims that Chyna also slept with Rarri True.\n\nPost 2: Rob then shared a series of texts he had received from a rapper named Rarri True, who he said was the man in the video\n\nPost 3: He claimed that Chyna cheated on him with this rapper, Rarri Tru3\n\n'Ok so we have an update haha! Chyna f***** me and this dude in her bed and then there is a third guy within 3 days all of each so thanks @shaderoom for clarifying.\n\n'So this is the dude she sent me the video of them f******' Rob continued, tagging Mechie in the post.\n\n'Lol so she f***** me then [Rarri True] then this dude in 3 days. With my daughter and her son in the house in my bed haha and my paid house. Damn this woman is crazy,' he said.\n\nHe then expressed his fears that he may have caught a venereal disease from Chyna since they had unprotected sex.\n\nPost 4: He also claimed that Chyna had a drinking and drugs problem\n\n'I'm scared but I promise imma get checked and do a full panel this week! I'm praying imma be clean but s*** Chyna.\n\n'So now the total is 8 dudes in less than a month come on man. This is wild. Omg I'm actually laughing,' he said.\n\nLater, Rarri True appeared to confirm the allegations by responding to one of the posts.\n\n'I used a condom do y'all really think I'll f*** her raw?' he wrote.\n\nPost 5: Rob claimed that Rarri True threatened to expose his relationship with Chyna if Rob didn't work with him\n\nPost 6: Rob said that he paid for Chyna to have plastic surgery after she gave birth to their daughter\n\nPost 7/17: In one of the posts, Rob claimed that he spent $250,000 on jewelry for Chyna\n\nPost 8: Rob said it was time for Chyna to 'get help'\n\nPost 9: Rob claimed their recent trip to Disneyland was staged for their image\n\nPost 10: Rob captioned this photo: 'Photo shopped the p**** tho for real with the smooth filter. This the same b**** who just FaceTime me a few hours ago faded and drunk out her mind taking her clothes off for me.'\n\nPost 11: Rob says Chyna 'only could breast feed for 4 weeks because she wanted to drink alcohol so bad'\n\nPost 12: 'Damn, I spent millions on this girl in less than a year and a half,' Rob wrote\n\nRob's posts didn't stop there, the sock designer then shared screenshots of texts from Rarri True, who he claims tried to blackmail him into working with him with the threat of exposing his relationship with Cyna.\n\n'This is the dude Chyna got caught cheating on me with for a minute now. And look he texted me asking for help and said he needed money cuz he can't afford to pay Chyna's bill so that's why I pay her bills.\n\n'More receipts are coming. Just yesterday Chyna sent me her p***y and everything and said she gonna come f*** me ... wait for it. Never once have I cheated on Chyna and I remained loyal to her even after all the cheating she been doing and the multiple men she been f***ing including me ... @ferraritru3' the father-of-one captioned the image.\n\nRob then accuses Chyna of doing drugs with a long post detailing substances she takes while 'bringing men in and out' of her home.\n\nPost 13: After other Instagram users pointed it out to him, Rob amended his original posts to say that the man pictured making out with Chyna was NOT Rarri True (above)\n\nPost 14: The man in the video, Rob now says, is the musician Mechie. However, he stands by his comments that Chyna also cheated on him with Rarri True\n\nIn question: Mechie (left) is the musician that Rob now says was in the video with Chyna. At first, he said it was the rapper Rarri True (right)\n\n'And here comes to the Drunk and on drugs Chyna. More receipts to come of all the drugs that were dropped off to her house yesterday including 100 bottles of Moet Rose she asked me to get her. U will never see Dream again unless u stop the alcohol and drugs and cocaine and X and E. lol.\n\n'That's called a party pack when was the last time u realized your daughter been with me instead of that crazy house that u bring men in an out. I never been this disrespected in my life by a woman. A woman I just paid 16K rent and Ferrari I just bought and lambo and 400K in jewelry. Damn.'\n\nRob even brought the T.I. into the fray when the rapper told him to move on.\n\nRob claimed in a post that T.I. and his now ex-wife Tiny paid Chyna to have a threesome with them.\n\nPost 15: Rob shared this text message conversation he says he had with Chyna on the Fourth of July\n\nInstagram later too down Rob's profile, but he just took his rant to Twitter.\n\n'Since Instagram shut me down everyone peep my twitter lol,' he wrote around 1:30pm Pacific time.\n\nHe then posted the same picture of Chyna without underwear on.\n\n'Chyna let me cum inside her a few days ago. Then next day she f***** a dude and a day after that she f***** another dude. All in my bed,' he wrote. 'My bed that my child lays in and she gave the robes I got to all her dudes in my house that I pay for. Lol smh.'\n\nHe went on to say that it's 'just sad' Chyna has left him after spending '100K on her body to get it done'.\n\nPost 16: Rob later claimed he would be recording his own Lemonade-style break-up album\n\nHe added: 'Loved Chyna as my wife and accepted all the wrong she did and continued to ride for her and remain Loyal to her. Never did I cheat. But she couldn't remain loyal and cheated and f***** way too many people and she got caught and now this is all happening and it's sad.\n\n'We had a beautiful baby girl that was the best thing that's happened to me and soon as that baby was born Chyna was out.'\n\nHe then made a reference to Chyna's ex-fianc\u00e9 Tyga dating his younger sister Kylie. The couple broke up earlier this year.\n\n'Soon as kylie and tyga broke up Chyna was over the game. She had a baby out of spit and I'll never view her the same,' Rob said.\n\n'I truly thought Chyna wanted to be a family and that's why I was so loyal to her but I learned my lesson and everyone else was right,' he added.\n\nPost 17: When the rapper TI called him out for the posts, Rob claimed that the rapper had a threesome with Chyna and his ex-wife, Tameka 'Tiny' Cottle-Harris\n\nAfter reposting the video of Chyna kissing Mechie, Rob wrote: 'Today Chyna sent me a video after I just bought her 250,000 of jewelry and she sends me this video...of another man in our bed,' he said.\n\nHe then posted two nude pictures of Chyna, and commented on her plastic surgery.\n\n'U had me take u to get surgery on your entire body for 100K on our anniversary and they made your nipples like this and I still loved all u,' he wrote.\n\nRob and Chyna were known to have a tempestuous relationship, with the pair first calling it quits in December - just weeks after the birth of their daughter Dream on November 10.\n\nPictured above is the rapper T.I. and his now ex-wife Tameka 'Tiny' Cottle-Harris\n\nSince then, there have been alternating reports that the couple are either back together or broken up again.\n\nThey were pictured together most recently on June 18, taking Dream to Disneyland. But in one of his posts, Rob said that the trip was staged for the paparazzi.\n\nEarlier this week, Chyna declared that she was single in an Instagram post, publishing an image that read: 'single. im happy'.\n\nChyna has a double connection to the Kardashian family through her ex-fiance, the rapper Tyga.\n\nThe two dated from 2011 until August 2014 and have a four-year-old son together, King Cairo. When they broke up, there were rumors that Tyga had been cheating on Chyna with Rob's younger sister Kylie, since he attended her birthday just days before calling off his engagement to Chyna. (Kylie and Tyga broke up earlier this year.)\n\nOnline: After Instagram shut down his profile for the tirade against Chyna, he took his rant to Twitter\n\nChyna started dating Rob in January 2016, and within three months they announced their engagement.\n\nThe following month, the new couple dropped another bombshell: announcing that Chyna was pregnant with Rob's child.\n\nThe couple even got their own KUWTK spin-off that fall, which showed them preparing for baby Dream.\n\nDream was born on November 10, 2016 - but a little more than a month later Rob and Chyna broke up.\n\nRob announced the news on Snapchat on December 17, recording several videos of his empty house after Chyna up and left with their newborn baby girl. The news came less than a week before the television special on Dream's birth aired.\n\n'I'm pretty upset and I'm pretty sad cause it's about to be Christmas, and I want to be with my baby,' Rob said in one of the videos, his voice cracking.\n\nAftermath: Following Rob's rant, Chyna posted video on Snapchat of her showing off diamond-encrusted watches and bracelets - presumably some of the jewelry he has purchased for her\n\nEarlier in the day, Chyna's Instagram account was commandeered by someone who claimed to have evidence Chyna was 'talking to' a number of guys while still with Rob, that she was planning to leave him and take the baby the whole time.\n\nThe hacker posted a number of text conversations purporting to be between Chyna and her friend Treasure, in which she apparently calls him lazy, fat, insecure, claimed he was gay, said he had a hairy face and never changed his clothes, and even appeared to consider 'slapping the sh*t' out of him as she had done to Tyga.\n\nThe hacker claimed Chyna had indeed already left Rob with Dream - and upon reading the leaked texts, the red-eyed Rob confirmed it.\n\n'Sorry to be so open but I'm not feeling so good after seeing @blacchyna messages about me and what her plans were,' he wrote on Instagram.\n\nRumour control: Earlier this week, Chyna took to Instagram to shut down rumours she was reconciling with Rob\n\n'I have never been this heartbroken in my life. I don't mind being so open or if anyone thinks I'm being weak but I don't play when it comes to Family and Chyna was my Family and thought we were getting married. I treated her as a Queen,' he wrote.\n\nThe couple did get back together, if only for a short period, to spend the holidays together with their baby girl.\n\nRob's Instagram rant comes a day after he posted several sweet pictures of him spending the Fourth of July with his daughter.\n\nThe snaps showed the 30-year-old smiling and playing with Dream in a pool.\n\nHappier times: The snaps showed the 30-year-old smiling and playing with Dream in a pool\n\nBonding time: Chyna shared several social media post including this cute one with Dream\n\nSelfie time: She posted a few filtered videos at the nail salon\n\nKeeping cool: She proudly showed off her green locks\n\nAww: Chyna looked happy to be bonding with her daughter\n\nAww: Dream smiled at the camera\n\nExcited? The Lashed entrepreneur posed with her mouth agape\n\nAww: Chyna squeezed Dream's cheeks", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/11/29/10/78367073-0-image-a-21_1701254529475.jpg",
