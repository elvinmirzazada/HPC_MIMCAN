Well, maybe more than a few. \"Oh, everything from the beginning of my career. I was dressing myself for so long and I see these outfits, like, 'Oh my God, what was I thinking?'\" she says. \"I even wore -- not so embarrassing but more like, 'interesting choice' -- this blue mermaid dress with a really high slit, to the G.I. Joe premiere. It was uber sexy, it was a little too much. It was a very pretty color - that's what got me!\"\n\n03 of 09 Her Fashion Is Otherworldly Good Splash News Online If you catch her on the street, you're likely to see her wearing \"anything that looks like a flowing fairy dress ... I'm so feminine and girlie and glam. But during the day I don't do my makeup, or hair. Just, like, 'I ain't got time for that!'\"\n\n04 of 09 And She Has It Covered FameFlynet According to the actress, this is the epitome of a Jenna Dewan Tatum style moment. \"In life I'm very hippie; I love flowy dresses, I love the hats, the cutoffs with the flowy tank tops,\" she says, adding \"[stylist Brad Goreski] thinks I have good street style!\"\n\n05 of 09 She'll Amp It Up When the Time Is Right Sara De Boer/startraks \"On red carpets, I like to be a bit more glamorous,\" she says. \"I like form-fitting, a little bit sexy, but I also enjoy a nice edgy moment orsomething that has a little zhuzh to it. I'm always looking for something a little more fun!\"\n\n06 of 09 She's a Sentimental Saver Everett \"I have this pair of green boots that I wore in Step Up. I like trying to keep little mementos from each job,\" she says. (She also got to walk away with that hottie in the photo -- and they recently proved they've still got moves! Sigh.)\n\n07 of 09 She's Gonna Need a Bigger Scrapbook KMazur/WireImage Also still in her closet? \"I have a tour jacket when I toured with Janet [Jackson], this 'All for You' tour jacket that I can't give away.\" (Yep, that's her in the background.)\n\n08 of 09 Dance Wear Is No Joke Jenna Dewan/Instagram \"When I was younger it was a lot of leotards, a lot of tights, a lot of leg warmers,\" she says of this classic look. \"Then I got more into jazz and contemporary and then as you get older it shifts. We would buy sweatpants and cut off the legs and then roll them up, or take the tights, cut them into stirrups and roll those up -- there are all sorts of dancer tricks. It sounds crazy but the more comfortable you feel wearing the dance clothes, the more fun and better you feel doing the dancing.\"", "images":
