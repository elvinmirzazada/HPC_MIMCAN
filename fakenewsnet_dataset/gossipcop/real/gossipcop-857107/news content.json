I went out with him on two dates.\u201d\n\nAnd as for what Frankel thought of Rodriguez\u2019s lip-locking skills? \u201cI honestly don\u2019t remember,\u201d she admitted.\n\nThe pair was rumored to have dated in early 2009 after his divorce from Cynthia Scurtis, whom he was married to for five years and has two daughters with: Natasha, 12, and Ella, 9.\n\nFast forward to the present, J-Rod is officially a couple.\n\nIn March, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that Lopez and Rodriguez had \u201cbeen dating for a few weeks.\u201d The athlete confirmed their relationship status during an appearance on The View, and the pair most recently made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 2017 Met Gala.\n\nLopez \u2014 who is mother to 9-year-old twins Max and Emme \u2014 and Rodriguez have gone on tropical vacations together, dined at a slew of upscale restaurants and recently celebrated Easter as one big family with their kids.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Frankel cleared up more romance rumors \u2014 this time with Eric Stonestreet, whom she was romantically linked to in July 2015.\n\n\u201cWe met and decided we make much better friends,\u201d said Stonestreet, who was also a guest on WWHL. \u201cBut she\u2019s a wonderful kisser,\u201d he joked.", "images":
