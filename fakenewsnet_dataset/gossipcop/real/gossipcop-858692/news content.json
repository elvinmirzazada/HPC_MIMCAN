Now, the World of Dance star is enjoying her new relationship with the retired baseball player traveling with their families and going on numerous\u2014and always stylish\u2014date nights.\n\nA video recently surfaced of JLo during her All I Have residency in Las Vegas making an interesting comment mid-performance after one of Drake\u2019s songs starting playing. \u201cHuh, booty call,\u201d she said when the rapper\u2019s \u201cHotline Bling\u201d track began to play. She gave the crowd a major hair flip and continued on with her performance.\n\nFans are speculating Lopez was throwing shade at the rapper, but the bit has apparently been in the star\u2019s show since opening night last year \u2014 long before she and Drake were ever linked together.\n\nIn his most recent album More Life, Drake rapped about Lopez in the track \u201cFree Smoke\u201d saying \u201cI drunk text JLo, wrong number so it bounce back.\u201d The rapper also sampled the Bronx-native\u2019s 1999 hit single \u2018If You Had My Love\u2019 for the song \u201cTeenage Fever.\u201d\n\nThe two stirred dating rumors last December after they both began posting photos together. A video was also leaked of them dancing close together at what looks like a winter wonderland-themed prom. \u201cHe just asked me to do a song with him and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. We\u2019ll see if it\u2019s on his next album,\u201d Lopez told ET in January.\u201cWe did one song together. I don\u2019t know if we will do more \u2013 we will see!\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/OeT4x4VR8FhoYLuLS0WApFRfHII=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/drake-the-weeknd-1-417d620dd3e74d74842e889208a6790e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rxiUu6efNnzwN_iYedWxBxQOWw8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x319:736x321)/Drake-Naming-Exes-01-030123-2b8e0f49da5a43d08b6c6d719546e8fd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/H1R0tkyPJ2JWvvO_Xovv03Mx9-0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck42-6a70ccb4b52647c087b1bd65be02c509.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/vseVRoBu1BeQrRkUDpxDrGHwBpg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1079x449:1081x451)/drake-dcb24fd1c49644c1b5e7de9ac22396cd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lRxWMa0rolQq4ssFshyuFIAkRNI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x119:736x121)/jennifer-lopez-met-look-050223-4847393983674f769ac4ab91c5e48d23.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/iccZJG6hVaS6aPvMSJODPdmpzfI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x9:736x11)/jlo-ben-necklace-031523-1d75013f065d4bac96c608001c395f0e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/UFhmud791Uy2mXbqC4TsfD8L_uY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/jennifer-lopez4-e04ae4b87c1e4c9ea2df5b8e2e9b0894.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KFgFbqlrmb299Sdjm9-rcBvXqZs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/gettyimages-1135845889-2000-f196f19f00c14ebb895921ed335a74b8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Xlcn72Gd5OHeAaKARAi41A2A42A=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x389:706x391)/alexis-ohanian-drake-serena-williams-110422-bc99032a84fe4741a942f41fb8d5e0f7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2NA1wJeo2uTzxSXYS9zmPlBhvCs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/drake-thirst-trap-041923-1-3ffd366838174698b0585e67ad1d9ded.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/y-5mkWShCEkGXqYn4fjsdUVJbHk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x9:736x11)/jennifer-lopez-makeup-050923-558d5bfd9f2d4761870f4b5334064a02.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/wMp4Cdv6YvcrTP8YZFKGiwl498Y=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x29:736x31)/soulja-boy-megan-thee-stallion-011023-a9c494e2521549e199c4c8f79c41785c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0gEJT49jjPyc5lM3CJ-zzMqBApU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x49:751x51)/jlo-gucci-dress-122622-4-e3552deb34cb457fa2faeb76b8929986.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/YSAgqReZ_afrtC1drIhn24sxPIY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x9:736x11)/drake-kim-kardashian-song-kanye-040423-1-697163e8b103462bad21af58351f5282.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/OhcKrmpC8YfNayWiBgik136iWC0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Suga-of-BTS-solo-tour-050123-05-2000-1-887bffeee9cb485aa7049003bea51165.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/WtK4pdNDlTZv_6Gt_IqkAg52uNI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Nicki-Minaj-b2e0ca6ddadc4375bc9f20d9f466bd55.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/sMVPI4GcududZukUa5se94LGUxE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(794x369:796x371)/a-rod-lopez-1-c5ba6df6df534054a9094f18bcaf6932.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/UFhmud791Uy2mXbqC4TsfD8L_uY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/jennifer-lopez4-e04ae4b87c1e4c9ea2df5b8e2e9b0894.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thatiana Diaz", "Thatiana Diaz Is A Former Digital Writer At People.
