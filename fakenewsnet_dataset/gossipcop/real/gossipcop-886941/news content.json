THREE\u2019S COMPANY,\u201d Disick captioned an Instagram image showing the trio relaxing on recliners \u2014 with Kardashian, 39, on his right, and Richie, 20, on his left \u2014 after the Daily Mail published photos of their day in the sun.\n\nThough Disick sat between them in the photo he shared, the ladies lounged next to each other at one point, chatting and looking at Kardashian\u2019s phone. Kardashian and Richie also walked on the beach together as the kids \u2014 Mason, 9, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 4 \u2014 played in the sand.\n\nKardashian opted for a black two-piece swimsuit, which she later partially covered up with a dark mini-skirt, while Richie wore an orange bikini and Disick rocked leopard-print swim trunks and a blue t-shirt.\n\nGiving her seal of approval, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian tweeted in response to a fan who called her sister\u2019s vacation \u201cco-parenting done right!!\u201d\n\n\u201cBeyond proud of all of them!!!! This is LOVE!! Your children before anything else!! All amazing adults right right!!!\u201d tweeted Khlo\u00e9, 34.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty Images; Taylor Hill/FilmMagic\n\nEarlier, the father of three shared a photograph of his son Mason sitting on a plane, surrounded by birthday decorations.\n\nThe couple\u2019s eldest child, who shares a birthday with their young son Reign, celebrated his birthday last week while Disick and Richie were traveling abroad.\n\n\u201cBirthday boy back at it again!!!\u201d Disick captioned the image.\n\nAlthough Richie and Disick have been dating for over a year and have gone on trips together with the father of three\u2019s children, this is the first time that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star has joined them.\n\nPrior to the trip, Kardashian was seen out and about with her ex and Richie on two separate occasions. On Nov. 4, the reality star joined the couple for what a source told PEOPLE was a \u201cquick\u201d and \u201ctense\u201d dinner. Then, on Nov. 16, they all attended a gallery exhibit.\n\nA source recently told PEOPLE that as her relationship with Disick grows stronger, Richie is continuing to navigate the complicated family dynamic with Kardashian.\n\n\u201cShe loves Scott and wants to be with him,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cShe loves being around Scott and his kids.\u201d\n\nThe insider also shared that Richie is happy to have built up some trust with Kardashian and \u201cproved to Kourtney that she is great with her kids.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Sofia Richie \u2018Knows\u2019 Kourtney Kardashian Isn\u2019t Her \u2018Biggest Fan\u2019 and Tries to \u2018Deal\u2019: Source\n\nAlthough Richie rarely discusses their relationship, while appearing on Australian talk show The Morning Show in September, she shared that she and Disick are \u201cvery happy.\u201d\n\nThe couple have been officially dating since September 2017 after initially sparking romance rumors that spring.", "images":
