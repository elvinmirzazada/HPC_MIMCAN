And slowly, we're peeling back the layers on Kenya's camera-shy hubby. Last week, NeNe Leakes shed some insight on his Brooklyn restaurant, SoCo, telling The Daily Dish that while she has yet to make the pilgrimage to the hotspot, the buzz is positive: \"I've heard that it's a good place.\"\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of Atlanta on Peacock and the Bravo App.\n\nSo when Kandi Burruss stopped by, we just had to learn more about the man in Kenya's life \u2014 and she definitely shined a new light on them as a couple, how Marc and Todd Tucker have bonded, and if the food at SoCo is really as tasty as the rumors suggest. Find out what she had to say in the video above.\n\nRelated\n\nMarc's restaurant recently got some major accolades when Travel Noire magazine voted SoCo as one of the 50 best restaurants in the country, and also named a fan favorite as well as an editor's pick.\n\nKenya and Marc surprised everyone when they married last June on the beach in St. Lucia. Below, you can hear more about their romance from Mrs. Daly herself.", "images": ["https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/03/dish-011918-kenya-kandi-double-date.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/10/kenya-moore.jpg?itok=rnYkDtwG", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/436/330/180305_3678594_Kandi_Burruss_Reveals_All_About_Kenya_Moore_.jpg?itok=33auxzjt", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/09/riley-burruss.jpg?itok=lxTprMw0", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/08/candiace-dillard_0.jpg?itok=GdzVOEzp", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_1310x530/public/2023/03/rhoa_s15-web-dynamiclead-desktop-1920x1080.jpg?itok=_DSS-wc1", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/40/423/RHOA_15_BONUS_CYNTHIA_BACKSTORY.jpg?itok=o7A2msBs", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/37/495/RHOA_15_BONUS_RILEY_BURRUSS_GROWING_UP_BRAVO__654341.jpg?itok=KN_z1_Tm", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/08/kandi-burruss-todd-tucker-drew-sidora.jpg?itok=-JCcPPV3", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/397/675/171212_3634627_The_Moment_When_Kenya_Moore_Knew_Her_Husband.jpg?itok=6EApX4Go", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/04/alexia-nepola-frankie-rosello-wwhl.jpg?itok=PvjMMiiN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/10/rhoa-eva-marcille-cynthia-bailey.jpg?itok=9JBWGwmk", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/07/robyn-dixon-skincare-business.jpg?itok=HYmaLIBv", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/06/todd-tucker-ace-tucker-blaze-tucker.jpg?itok=5n-QO1cH", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/themes/custom/reality/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/Erika-Jayne.jpg?itok=Y2WJV_vf", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/08/rhoa-kandi-burruss-mama-joyce-todd-tucker.jpg?itok=gdgpaQb5", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2022/07/daily-dish-rhoa-kenya-moore-kandi-burruss.jpg?itok=LoAcz3iR", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/glamour-red-carpet-looks.jpg?itok=Q5fgBzP2", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/242/771/RHOA_15_BONUS_DREW_RALPH_RELATIONSHIP_TIMELINE_PT2.jpg?itok=Ggpwc1kq", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/08/season-15-reunion-kandi-burruss_0.jpg?itok=VydhuI49"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/03/dish-011918-kenya-kandi-double-date.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/kandi-burruss-talks-kenya-moores-husband-marc-daly", "title": "Kenya Moore's Husband Marc Daly Information: Video", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1134550, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Kandi Spills About Kenya's \\\"No Nonsense\\\" Husband\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_tv_shows\":\"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\",\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/03\\/dish-011918-kenya-kandi-double-date.jpg?itok=fgcnjdSO\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/03\\/dish-011918-kenya-kandi-double-date.jpg?itok=rcqQ1UV2\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/03\\/dish-011918-kenya-kandi-double-date.jpg?itok=xdOLKyLJ\",\"70x70\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/fp_scale_crop_70x70\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/03\\/dish-011918-kenya-kandi-double-date.jpg?itok=RkK7lurX\"}}", "description": "While we haven't seen Marc Daly on The Real Housewives of Atlanta, Kenya Moore's husband and his NYC eatery have definitely been a hot topic of discussion for the squad and viewers.
