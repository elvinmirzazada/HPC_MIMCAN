These scores will help determine who wins Season 24 of the ABC network competition Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Everyone has their own personal best and it looks different obviously, but tonight I definitely feel you hit your personal best. Thank you for giving us the freestyle we wanted,\" judge Carrie Ann Inaba told Ross and Arnold.\n\nThis was the first time the pair earned 10s from the judges. Unfortunately, they didn't fare as well in their first dance of the night, the Viennese waltz, because of Ross' technical flaws.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"David, I've got to say, first, congratulations on making it through to the final. It's a truly Cinderella story. I never dreamt you'd make it to the ball, but here you are,\" judge Len Goodman said. \"There is improvement in your dancing overall, but for me, not so much in the Viennese waltz.\"\n\nRoss and Arnold are at the bottom of the leaderboard because of the waltz score. NFL running back Rashad Jennings and partner Emma Slater scored 80 out of 80 points Monday, while singer Normani Kordei and pro dancer Valentin Chmerkovskiy earned 78 points.\n\nBut the pairs are not done dancing. On Tuesday, each couple will fuse two contrasting dance styles they've performed this season for judges' points. The pairs have less than 24 hours to prepare for that dance.\n\nViewer votes and judges' points from last week and Monday will be combined with judges' points from the Tuesday 24-hour challenge to determine the winner of the mirror-ball trophy.\n\nRoss acknowledged Monday that he made it to the finals not because of the judges' scores, but via support from his fans and former teammates.\n\n\"Just being in the finals, one, is way more than I ever expected and the fact that I've got support from so many great people, and that they look up to me and watch this show and support me, just ... I don't even have the words, just a lot of thanks,\" Ross said.\n\nTuesday's two-and-a-half-hour finale is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCubs' David Ross to dance to 'Take Me Out to the Ball Game' in 'Dancing with the Stars' finals\n\nDid Cubs' David Ross foxtrot into the 'Dancing with the Stars' finals?\n\nDavid Ross' ESPN debut: Too much 'Dancing,' not enough baseball\n\nShould Chris Pratt play Cubs' David Ross in movie about Ross' life?\n\nDavid Ross on his new book: 'I didn't want to write (it)'\n\nCould Cubs' David Ross waltz into the 'Dancing with the Stars' semifinals?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDid Cubs' David Ross survive double elimination on 'Dancing with the Stars'?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the latest movie trailers.\n\nExpand Autoplay Image 1 of 122 Sophie Turner as Jean Grey, anger management student, in \"Dark Phoenix.\" The film, the latest in the \"X-Men\" franchise, costars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender and Jessica Chastain.
