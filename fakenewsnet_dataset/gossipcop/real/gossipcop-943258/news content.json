In a series of tweets, Dove revealed that the rumors started because of recent social media posts that many fans had believed meant that the couple had broken up.\n\nPSA: THOMAS AND I ARE FINE. no we are not broken up yes we are still together no we are not fighting we are madly in love and better than ever please stop speculating/spreading rumors when you have absolutely no basis all smooth sailing over here thanks for checking innnnnn\n\n\n\nnot everything i post has to do with thomas. ESPECIALLY when it\u2019s vague/negative. i wouldn\u2019t indirect my boyfriend like that? i\u2019m not 11? i definitely wouldn\u2019t be sneakily hinting at issues in my relationship like hidden meaning easter-egg clues? my life isn\u2019t a reality show? bye\n\nDove and Thomas first got together after meeting on the set of Descendants 2. They are both currently filming Descendants 3, which will be released later next year.\n\nA few days before, Dove posted several pictures of her and Thomas together back-to-back on Instagram. One of the posts also included a caption where she reffered to breakup rumors again.\n\nIt also seems that Dove will be taking some time off of Twitter after she continued to get messages from people in response to her original tweets. She also sent out one final tweet to her fans before she left.\n\nTamara Fuentes is the Entertainment Editor at Seventeen.com.
