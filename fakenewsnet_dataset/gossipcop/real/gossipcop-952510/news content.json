Little did they know that two decades later, Meghan would be married to Prince Harry and a full-fledged member of the royal family!\n\nMunn recreated the piece of royal history alongside pal Matthew Hoffman, who shared the imitation picture on Instagram and included their inspiration in his post. Hoffman took Meghan\u2019s spot with Munn sitting to his left, perched on the top of the barricade with their feet on the lower rail, just like Meghan and her pal.\n\n\u201c\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Tourists,\u201d Hoffman captioned the set of pictures, which also included snaps on top of a double decker bus and some vacation selfies.\n\nMatthew Hoffman and Olivia Munn. Matthew Hoffman/Instagram\n\nOf course, Meghan doesn\u2019t have to stay behind the palace gates any longer. After meeting Prince Harry on a blind date in July 2016, she quickly won the royal\u2019s heart and the two wed at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle in May 2018.\n\nThe 36-year-old American made her official debut on the iconic balcony of Buckingham Palace in June during the Trooping the Colour celebrations to mark the Queen\u2019s official birthday.\n\nJames Whatling/MEGA\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nAfter a horse-drawn carriage ride with Harry to Buckingham Palace, Meghan gathered on the balcony with the rest of the royals to take in the iconic fly-past by the Royal Air Force. Meghan\u2019s first appearance on the balcony, which came just weeks after she wed Prince Harry, was symbolic of how she has been welcomed into the family.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Meghan Markle Finds Certain Royal Rules \u2018Difficult to Understand,\u2019 Says Source\n\nIn addition to the Queen herself, Meghan was joined by new husband, her in-laws, Prince William and Kate Middleton, and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte (Prince Louis stayed home during the festivities!). Prince Philip, Prince Charles, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall were also in attendance.\n\nDavid Fisher/Shutterstock\n\nDavid Fisher/REX/Shutterstock\n\nMeghan was back on the balcony a month later, when she stood right next to the Queen herself to celebrate 100 years of the Royal Air Force. During the event, they observed a thunderous fly-over by 100 aircrafts, including jet fighters, World War II Lancaster bombers and the ceremonial Red Arrows. There was also a Feu de Joie, or mass rifle salute, to complete the military pageantry.", "images":
