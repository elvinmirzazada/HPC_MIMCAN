Variety reports that several concept ideas set in the same universe as Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) are being discussed between the streaming service and producer Media Rights Capital. One focuses on political aide-de-camp Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), with House of Cards S 1-4 executive producer Eric Roth set to write. The publication reports that at least two other concepts are being explored, but no writers are attached yet.The report comes in the wake of Netflix's official announcement that House of Cards will end after season 6 , which TVLine says was a decision made months ago, rather than made in the light of the recent disturbing allegations made against Spacey. Netflix and series producer Media Rights Capital released a joint statement yesterday saying they are \"deeply troubled\" by these allegations, but as of writing, season 6 is still going ahead.For more on House of Cards, read IGN's review of the most recent series\n\nHouse of Cards: Season 5 Photos 23 Images\n\nLucy O'Brien is Games & Entertainment Editor at IGN\u2019s Sydney office.
