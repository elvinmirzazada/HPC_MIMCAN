But in tandem with that, he realized that the love of his life was among the election-rigging scheme team.\n\nOh, and also during that very bad day he ushered a frail Supreme Court Justice to her death, to boot.\n\nTVLine spoke with POTUS\u2019 portrayer about his first (and difficult) reading of that dynamics-changing script, the \u201cdevastating\u201d actions of she whom Fitz had put on \u201cthe highest pedestal,\u201d and the Season 2 scene that has surprised him the most.\n\nRELATED | Scandal Post Mortem: Shonda Rhimes Defends Killer Twist and Fitz\u2019s Shocking Decision\n\nTVLINE | We\u2019re coming off quite an episode. What do you think raced through Fitz\u2019s head when Verna revealed to him the truth about the election rigging?\n\nIt was, I think, a three-part reaction. Maybe four parts. First, it was complete shock at what she was saying to him, because at first he thought she was in her delirium. When he does realize what she\u2019s saying, the realization that Olivia was involved is absolutely crushing for him because, you know\u2026 he \u201cgets\u201d Mellie. And he\u2019s not terribly shocked that Cyrus is an opportunist, even though he\u2019s deeply hurt and disappointed. But Olivia is someone who Fitz had put on a pedestal \u2014 the highest pedestal, really. She is someone he came to rely on as a reflection of the best part of himself or the man that he aspired to be, which was the antithesis of his father. So her having betrayed him in that way invalidates everything for him and confirms his worst fears, in a sense, about himself. If she is corrupt, then everything loses all meaning. And that\u2019s absolutely devastating.\n\nTVLINE | And the way Verna drove the dagger in a bit further, with the comment about his father\u2026.\n\nWhen Verna says, \u201cI owed it to your father\u201d to tell you the truth\u2026 That\u2019s a moment where he, for me, was first saying, \u201c[My father] wins. He was right about me,\u201d and I think the bottom falls out of his life. And when I walk to the [hospital room] door, in that moment I think he has the opposite reaction. He sort of feels, \u201cI\u2019m not going to let [my father] win. He\u2019s not going to beat me. I made a commitment to be something, to do this job right. And this was not my decision to steal [the election].\u201d I think he believes he could have won it, maybe, and he\u2019s not going to let Verna, this sort of surrogate for his father, take him down \u2014 so he makes this insane decision to kill her.\n\nTVLINE | Actors, of course, can be very protective of their characters. What was your reaction when you heard for the first time that Fitz would end Verna\u2019s life?\n\nWe got this script very late; I don\u2019t think any of us got it before the table read. So when we sat down to read it out loud together and I got to the scene that precedes that \u2014 at Verna\u2019s funeral, when Olivia comes up to me and says, \u201cI will wait for you Fitz. I\u2019ll wait as long as you need,\u201d and I turn to her and say, \u201cOh yeah, about that; I changed my mind\u201d \u2014 I was completely shocked. I literally couldn\u2019t speak the words. I couldn\u2019t figure out where that came from because [it preceded the flashback to Verna\u2019s reveal]. As far as I knew, the last time I spoke to Liv, I said, \u201cWait for me,\u201d and suddenly coming out of my mouth are these words that are the antithesis of what I\u2019ve felt. I somehow forced the words out and [series creator] Shonda [Rhimes] looked at me and mouthed, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be OK, don\u2019t worry.\u201d And then the scene came up, the scene with Verna that followed, and I realized, \u201cOh my God, I\u2019m going to kill her.\u201d I was shocked by that, but I was less shocked than I was by my reversal with Liv. I couldn\u2019t process that. I had, like, a literal and physical reaction.\n\nTVLINE | I wanted to ask about that funeral scene. Up until then, every scene between you and Kerry Washington was either simmering or boiling over. Was it kind of odd for you two to do your first scene where it was just ice cold?\n\nBecause I didn\u2019t understand what was informing it, reading it was really bizarre. But actually doing it wasn\u2019t so hard for me because I had the context of how much her betrayal meant to me. Kerry would have a very different perspective on this, but for me, at that moment, Fitz feels that\u2019s he\u2019s been completely used by her, that everything he attributed to her was phony and she was no different from the rest of them and all of her protestations of loving him and blaming him and being a victim of him, and the Sally Hemmings business, was all bulls\u2013t. That she really wanted him president because she wanted to trade on that power. I suddenly saw her as the worst kind of political opportunist who, sure, in one sense, can say she was in love with me, but she wasn\u2019t in love with me. She was using me. Remember that scene where we touch the Constitution and I say, \u201cIt\u2019s everything\u201d and she says, \u201cIt\u2019s everything. It\u2019s a new world\u201d? To connect in terms of our political ideals was so profound for him, and to have that betrayed was the worst thing that could possibly happen.\n\nVIDEO | Scandal Sneak Peek: Fitz Gives [Spoiler] the Big Chill, David Deals With a Bloody Mess\n\nTVLINE | Adding to the bittersweetness of the funeral scene was the look Olivia was giving Fitz as she said, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d Her eyes were like saucers and so full of hope. She had this new outlook on a future she had thought impossible just a few scenes prior.\n\nI know. And she\u2019d always been the opposite. I\u2019d always been the one fighting for her and she was pushing me away constantly, so to all of a sudden have that switched\u2026. It\u2019s brilliantly written. In a way, it\u2019s so easy to play because the writing was so good. And now I\u2019m fascinated to see where this is going to go, because I don\u2019t know \u2014 how do they reconnect?\n\nTVLINE | Meanwhile, where do things stand with Mellie and Fitz in this Thursday\u2019s episode, picking up 10 months later?\n\nYou know, it\u2019s not good. You\u2019ll see this week. It ain\u2019t good. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re all I\u2019ve got\u2026. You\u2019re the only one who has always been honest about who you are,\u201d and I think that he credits her with that. They try to make it work. They do try, but it\u2019s very, very difficult and I think that sends Fitz into a real tailspin. He\u2019s very depressed, so it\u2019s not going to be easy with Mellie.\n\nTVLINE | The one confrontation we didn\u2019t see was with Cyrus. How are things between the president and his chief of staff?\n\nFitz boxes Cyrus out. This is never explained, but for me, he has to keep Cyrus close because he can\u2019t fire him, because he knows too much. If Cyrus were to turn against him, that would be very bad, so he has to control Cyrus. Fitz is in a very tough place right now.\n\nTVLINE | Out of Season 2 to date, which scene or moment has surprised you the most?\n\nThe one I mentioned [above]. That scene in the church when I tell Olivia I\u2019ve changed my mind, and I say that mean thing to her about how sleeping with my mistress is one thing, but marrying her is another. That really shocked me.\n\nTVLINE | Your next TV directing gig is with Scandal, right?\n\nI\u2019m going to be directing Scandal next month. At the moment, it\u2019s supposed to be Episode 20. That\u2019s not in stone, but I think it\u2019s going to be 20.\n\nWant more scoop on Scandal, or for any other show?

To connect in terms of our political ideals was so profound for him, and to have that betrayed was the worst thing that could possibly happen.\r\n\r\nVIDEO | Scandal Sneak Peek: Fitz Gives [Spoiler] the Big Chill, David Deals With a Bloody Mess\r\n\r\nTVLINE | Adding to the bittersweetness of the funeral scene was the look Olivia was giving Fitz as she said, \"I'll wait for you.\" Her eyes were like saucers and so full of hope. She had this new outlook on a future she had thought impossible just a few scenes prior.\r\nI know. And she\u2019d always been the opposite. I\u2019d always been the one fighting for her and she was pushing me away constantly, so to all of a sudden have that switched\u2026. It\u2019s brilliantly written. In a way, it's so easy to play because the writing was so good. And now I\u2019m fascinated to see where this is going to go, because I don\u2019t know -- how do they reconnect?\r\n\r\nTVLINE | Meanwhile, where do things stand with Mellie and Fitz in this Thursday's episode, picking up 10 months later?\r\nYou know, it\u2019s not good. You\u2019ll see this week. It ain\u2019t good. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re all I\u2019ve got\u2026. You\u2019re the only one who has always been honest about who you are,\u201d and I think that he credits her with that. They try to make it work. They do try, but it\u2019s very, very difficult and I think that sends Fitz into a real tailspin. He's very depressed, so it\u2019s not going to be easy with Mellie.\r\n\r\nTVLINE | The one confrontation we didn\u2019t see was with Cyrus. How are things between the president and his chief of staff?\r\nFitz boxes Cyrus out. This is never explained, but for me, he has to keep Cyrus close because he can\u2019t fire him, because he knows too much. If Cyrus were to turn against him, that would be very bad, so he has to control Cyrus. Fitz is in a very tough place right now.\r\n\r\nTVLINE | Out of Season 2 to date, which scene or moment has surprised you the most?\r\nThe one I mentioned [above]. That scene in the church when I tell Olivia I\u2019ve changed my mind, and I say that mean thing to her about how sleeping with my mistress is one thing, but marrying her is another. That really shocked me.\r\n\r\nTVLINE | Your next TV directing gig is with Scandal, right?\r\nI\u2019m going to be directing Scandal next month. At the moment, it\u2019s supposed to be Episode 20. That\u2019s not in stone, but I think it\u2019s going to be 20.\r\n\r\nWant more scoop on Scandal, or for any other show?
