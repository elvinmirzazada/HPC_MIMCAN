Alongside the image, the restaurant wished Kunis a happy birthday, and noted that she celebrated the special occasion during her visit on Monday.\n\nNa ki \u00fcnnepelte n\u00e1lunk a sz\u00fclet\u00e9snapj\u00e1t?\ud83c\udf82\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude18 #milakunis #hbdaymila #ashtonkutcher #budapest #vintagegarden #restaurant #bistro A post shared by Vintage Garden D\u00f6me (@vintagegardenbistro) on Aug 14, 2017 at 11:47am PDT\n\nOther diners shared photos of the couple seated outside with friends and their children: daughter Wyatt, 2\u00bd, and son Dimitri, 9 months.\n\nKunis is currently filming new comedy, The Spy Who Dumped Me, in the city.\n\nOver the weekend, Kunis and Kutcher, 39, took in Budapest\u2019s Sziget Festival, which included a performance by Wiz Khalifa. The pair were photographed watching Khalifa\u2019s set from atop a scaffolding structure.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Mila Kunis Opens Up About When She Realized There Was Something More with Ashton Kutcher!\n\nEarlier this year, Kutcher gushed about his children during an appearance on The Tonight Show, revealing that Wyatt is already perfectly poised to be a world traveler because she speaks three languages.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird because girls advance apparently faster than boys,\u201d Kutcher explained. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this, but researched early childhood advancement. My daughter is 2\u00bd [and] she speaks three languages; she\u2019s got Russian and Spanish and English. She actually understands and speaks them.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/chrissy-metz5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1500px%2C1003px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/oprah1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1157px%2C774.0880952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/ashton-kutcher2.jpg?w=1500&h=1743", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://people.com/celebrity/mila-kunis-ashton-kutcher-budapest-vintage-garden-birthday/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/ashton-kutcher2.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1500px%2C788px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/zayn-malik.jpg?crop=263px%2C159px%2C1457px%2C974px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/christina-el-moussa.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1525px%2C1020.2976190476px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/kim-kardashian2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1500px%2C1003px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/chris-hemsworth6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1487px%2C994.87380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/chris-pratt-anna-faris-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/anna-faris4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1196px%2C800.18095238095px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/chris-brown-rihanna.jpg?crop=156px%2C0px%2C1813px%2C1214px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/8-28-long.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/ashton-kutcher2.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1500px%2C788px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Kimble"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719/http://people.com/celebrity/mila-kunis-ashton-kutcher-budapest-vintage-garden-birthday/", "title": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher Celebrate Her Birthday in Budapest", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1143086910", "description": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher are currently in Budapest, Hungary, where she is filming comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me", "keywords": "Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis in hungary, mila kunis birthday", "news_keywords": "Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis in hungary, mila kunis birthday", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher Are All Smiles During Budapest Outing for Her Birthday", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719/http://people.com/celebrity/mila-kunis-ashton-kutcher-budapest-vintage-garden-birthday/", "description": "Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher are currently in Budapest, Hungary, where she is filming comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170816203719im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/ashton-kutcher2.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1500px%2C788px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-16T15:11:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-16T15:00:28+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@people", "creator": "@people"}, "application-name": "PEOPLE.com", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://people.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/a39c9d87d3ee529a684f7a5b3b557adc?s=16"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502896262.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
