Kidman is wearing a light blue suit with a stunning head piece.\n\nIn March 2017, Kidman confirmed she was playing Aquaman\u2019s mother in \u201cAquaman,\u201d and there was a simple reason as to why she wanted to take on the role.\n\n\u201cThe reason why I love [\u2018Aquaman\u2019] is James Wan is an Australian, and I\u2019ve followed his career since he started. He\u2019s a really good friend of mine, and he offered to let me play Queen Atlanna,\u201d she told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cAs soon as he said I could wear mother-of-pearl and be a mermaid warrior, I said \u2018I\u2019m done.\u2019 Please. If there is one thing I have to do in my life, I have to be that. Because, you\u2019ve got to have some fun.\u201d\n\nHer role in the DC film marks her return to the superhero franchise \u2014 the last time she starred in a movie like that was in 1995\u2019s \u201cBatman Forever,\u201d when she played Bruce Wayne\u2019s girlfriend, Dr. Chase Meridian. However, since then, she\u2019s won an Academy Award and has been nominated multiple times.\n\n\u201cAquaman,\u201d which also stars Willem Dafoe, Dolph Lundgren and Patrick Wilson, will hit theaters on Dec. 21.\n\nSee the cover below.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-902351242.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/The-Holdovers.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-902351242.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Knox-Goes-Away.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/American-Symphony-Jon-Batiste.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screen-Shot-2018-06-14-at-9.27.47-AM.png?resize=618%2C820", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Michelle-Satter-Michael-Latt.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-902351242.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Steve Pond", "Benjamin Lindsay", "Drew Taylor", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/aquaman-nicole-kidman-queen-atlanna-first-look-photo/", "title": "\u2018Aquaman\u2019: See First Look of Nicole Kidman as Queen Atlanna (Photo)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Aquaman': See First Look of Nicole Kidman as Queen Atlanna (Photo) - TheWrap", "description": "Kidman is playing Aquaman's mother in the film hitting theaters Dec. 21", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/aquaman-nicole-kidman-queen-atlanna-first-look-photo/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-902351242.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-06-14T16:59:57+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "\u2018Aquaman\u2019: See First Look of Nicole Kidman as Queen Atlanna (Photo)", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/aquaman-nicole-kidman-queen-atlanna-first-look-photo/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-06-14T09:59:57-07:00", "parsely-section": "movies", "parsely-author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "parsely-tags": "amber_heard, aquaman, entertainment_weekly, james_wan, jason_momoa, nicole-kidman", "article-tags": "amber_heard, aquaman, entertainment_weekly, james_wan, jason_momoa, nicole-kidman}", "article-section": "movies", "article-categories": "movies", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528995597.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
