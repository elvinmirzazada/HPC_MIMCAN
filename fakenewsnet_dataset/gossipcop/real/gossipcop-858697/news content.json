Seated alongside Tom Cruise and his The Mummy costar Annabelle Wallis, the Baywatch star showed off his impressive core strength with the help of a stripper pole.\n\nEfron was goaded into the exhibition after Norton showed the audience a photo of the oft-shirtless actor turning himself into a human flag, using a parking meter as a pole. When Norton asked Efron if the picture had been photoshopped, fellow exercise enthusiast Cruise said, \u201cNo, he\u2019s doing it.\u201d\n\nFrom Coinage: See Where 6 Stars Were Before They Were Famous\n\nJust in case there was any doubt, the talk show host made sure to have a pole onset to give Efron an opportunity to show off. Taking the bait, Efron approached the pole \u2014 this time with his shirt on \u2014 and asked for some music to get himself in the mood.\n\nSerenading the crowd with Flo Rida\u2019s classic \u201cApple Bottom Jeans,\u201d Efron did a little dance before effortlessly making his body perpendicular to the pole.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly as seductive as some of the moves from Magic Mike, but the core strength is definitely there. Plus, it was enough to earn a standing ovation from Norton and his fellow guests.", "images":
