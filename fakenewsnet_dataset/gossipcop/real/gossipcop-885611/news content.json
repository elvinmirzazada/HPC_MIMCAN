Kit Harington announced his engagement to his Game of Thrones costar Rose Leslie on September 27, and now we get to see her engagement ring. The 30-year-old actress was spotted at London\u2019s Heathrow airport looking fresh faced with a big diamond on her ring finger.\n\nThe couple has HBO to thank for their relationship. They began dating in 2012 after first meeting on set and playing love interests until (spoiler alert!) Rose\u2019s character, Ygritte, was killed off. Kit, who plays Jon Snow, alluded to a forever future with Rose earlier this year. \u201dYgritte is the only woman for Jon. Always,\u201d he exclusively told Us Weekly in July. \u201cThere will be no one else.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment his character does not seem to share, having gotten together with Emilia Clarke\u2019s character Daenerys this past season!\n\nRelated: Winter Is Here and So Are These \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Inspired Beauty Products Winter is here and we have just the products to hold you over until the new season of Game of Thrones!\n\nThe couple first hit the red carpet together at the Oliver Awards in London in April 2016, where Rose rocked a red Christian Dior tulle gown from their Spring 2017 collection. The twosome formally announced their engagement in The Times\u2019 \u201cForthcoming Marriages\u201d section.\n\n\u201cMr. K.C. Harington and Miss R.E. Leslie,\u201d the post read. \u201cThe engagement is announced between Kit, younger son of David and Deborah Harington of Worcestershire, and Rose, middle daughter of Sebastian and Candy Leslie of Aberdeenshire.\u201d\n\nThank You!

What I meant to say was, I popped my question a bit early. Not blew my load.\u201d\n\nRelated: Kit Harington on 'Game of Thrones' Season 7: Will Jon Snow Find Love?
