So obviously, between freaking out over how they're totally twinning with their matching blonde hair and mooning over how amazing the colors look on each other, they slipped in some cryptic jokes about babies.\n\n\"Every color looks amazing on you,\" Kylie told Khloe, the collection's namesake, after trying out all the colors.\n\n\"We created them,\" Khloe responded. \"It\u2019s our baby together, we have eight!\u201d\n\nApparently not caring that this joke would send Kylie and JKhlie fans into a tailspin of speculation, Kylie responded with, \u201cWe have so many babies, who knew?\u201d\n\nWho knew? Really? Considering every \"source\" imaginable has confirmed your pregnancies except you, YOU KNEW!\n\nWatch the video below and see for yourself.\n\nGuess the cryptic dancing around confirming Kylie and Khloe's pregnancies will continue into the foreseeable future. It's maddening! *sob*\n\nNoelle Devoe is the Entertainment Web Editor at Seventeen.com.
