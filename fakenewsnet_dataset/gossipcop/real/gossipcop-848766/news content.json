Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in honor of his late grandfather.\n\nPEOPLE gave you the lowdown on Schlossberg last year, but here are five new things to know about him.\n\n1. Schlossberg has been living in Japan the past year.\n\nSchlossberg, whose mother, Caroline, is the U.S. ambassador to Japan, graduated from Yale in 2015 with a degree in history with a focus on Japanese history. After graduation, he joined his mom in Japan, where he worked at Suntory, a distillery company, where he assisted the CEO s office with research and speech writing, and studied the Japanese language.\n\n2. Schlossberg is becoming one of the more public Kennedy\u2019s of his generation\n\nWhile his older sisters, Rose and Tatiana, have become more visible this past year: Rose, 27, recently launched a comedy web series offering females tips for surviving an apocalypse, while her sister, Tatiana, 25, is a reporter for The New York Times, it s Jack who s been more vocal about politics. He recently wrote an essay for TIME in which he called for \u201ccourage\u201d on the Syrian refugee crisis and praised the recipient of this year\u2019s JFK Profile in Courage Award, Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, for welcoming a family of Syrian refugees into his state.\n\nHe also wrote an essay for Politico in January in which he condemned Ted Cruz\u2019s suggestion that if JFK were alive today, he would be a Republican.\n\n\u201cWere my grandfather alive today, he\u2019d be excited about how far we have come as a nation since 1963, he would feel a sense of urgency about the challenges that lie ahead and he most certainly would not be a Republican,\u201d Schlossberg wrote. In fact, he added of his grandfather, \u201che would be shocked by just how far the Republican Party has lost its way.\u201d\n\n3. As the new face of the JFK Profile in Courage Awards, Schlossberg has displayed his grandfather s famous charm.\n\nWith his mom overseas in Japan, Schlossberg, noted today that he hadn t been in a room full of native English speakers in almost a year \u2013 and then added with a smile, \u201cThen again, we\u2019re in Boston so English-speakers may not be entirely accurate.\u201d\n\n4. Schlossberg has the family s gift for outdoor sports.\n\nHe ran his first triathalon earlier this year on Long Island and has recently started kiteboarding.\n\n5. Those close to Schlossberg say he takes after his uncle John F. Kennedy Jr., who died in 1999.\n\nThough Schlossberg has described himself as a \u201cstudent of [his grandfather\u2019s] life, legacy and administration,\u201d people who know him well say he has a lot in common with his uncle JFK Jr.\n\n\u201cJack is very much interested in John,\u201d a friend of John\u2019s told PEOPLE in 2015. \u201cHe has an ease and a sense of humor. And he loves being compared to him. John was a rare kind of celebrity who grew up with being famous and had fun with it and didn\u2019t let it take over his life.\u201d\n\nAnd soon, we may be seeing more of Schlossberg, who is planning to move to Washington, D.C., to work on climate change. \u201cJack\u2019s a great young man and in the family tradition, he\u2019s a thoroughbred,\u201d Gov. Molloy tells PEOPLE. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s going to have a great public life, if he should so choose.\u201d\n\n\u2022 With reporting by JULIET PENNINGTON", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/-6jlALdc4YZZvlg4YoE0mMKmf7g=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x329:766x331)/zelenskyy-bucha-ad2835949f364f07b7be2dff18e24717.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/YB0KSKhSTKIUwGCX32fPqn0U6T8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x739:1021x741)/schwarzenegger-family-2764502b05c84819b0ef79fd12a3d28d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Y7FTAZk5q8QrK8TlA5uYMFy2L-Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x374:1021x376)/gordon-ramsay-family-1-9158ea4d5168470b940a9088a77f0f68.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/oSxjioIEN6qHtAPGIzCRlZh_uog=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/2024-presidential-republican-debate-ron-desantis-082323-1-7c04f0e5064c4b0a910bd96e7f18286d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/RCs1KbQpO7n5sUMOf6-Qe6DePEg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x438:921x440)/liz-cheney-1-f38a8cf19f3740b197c1ca0c58073d0c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/IGENXckaJIC32AXaTmMMO8KsmVU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(511x0:513x2)/jack-schlossberg-2-1024-dadb44898df541e8b9126d41cb3487cf.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zRqyU-llsoM3CBn8jdFjid_ecNQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/jackie-kennedy-cover-tout-df7971bc7f254b658522cf38a61b8d23.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/TCh-pJ4pzLGplL-x3GfLNfGVXaU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(659x379:661x381)/jack-schlossberg-1-98c7e2827e8e4041bb843f1b322577dc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7L4j2nXgf0ULXHh4PxQc8aqliNU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/gov-ron-desantis-041423-1-46399090d59c41f995a55dbaf259fa9f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/uWkhniU-J3G7A8mpcsT-AO4MySw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(689x29:691x31)/caroline-kennedy-surfing-042123-2-56073a1108c142a183e6835cb65bbeef.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qqsI8g9pkHCxTc7fsO86EVplvu8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Joe-Biden-and-Robert-F-Kennedy-Jr-2019112582-0051dfba1b2e4b298b391a381082a426.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/RIoLxiPKOK4xDWMMFDvgfEmYsNo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x638:1001x640)/robert-f.-kennedy-jr-press-conference-041923-2efd9ded457c4caf8234e8da8125b88e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/pBdHakZC_s7PT8ACfHBc_9dUdh8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x447:961x449)/japan-royal-family-tout-aeb3cba403344ce8bd50d80d2296023f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/TDHtYmb6zb5v5x24sVTkbStNOuc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x299:736x301)/Robert-Kennedy-Jr-b94f6316ca2e4850b0e6ed6da75bd74b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/v1eYOfDT_5Eme_769KLfe4RuhXk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x9:736x11)/Jack-Schlossberg-paddleboarding-after-passing-bar-exam-042123-1-a3f013f257284ac0be17ac6986a50dea.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/UXY0qrZrAsG0OASK04xOtbPa97c=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(748x227:750x229)/Ron-DeSantis-family-01-052423-43c52e0963aa43a289edb3937fec1fd5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/870ZEV9ke-jk_ijPw7TUIT2vbDQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(742x69:744x71)/Jack-Schlossberg-Is-a-Double-for-His-Uncle-JFK-Jr-in-shirtless-Photo-053223-e088916c80264b4eb399fb144ab1fe2c.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/IGENXckaJIC32AXaTmMMO8KsmVU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(511x0:513x2)/jack-schlossberg-2-1024-dadb44898df541e8b9126d41cb3487cf.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liz Mcneil", "Tierney Mcafee Is A Former Staff Editor At People.
