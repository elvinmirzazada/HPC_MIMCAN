The government ultimately refused to allow Margaret to marry him unless she gave up her royal privileges. She chose the privileges. \"I would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Captain Peter Townsend,\" she said in a statement in 1955. \"I have been aware that, subject to my renouncing my rights of succession, it might have been possible for me to contract a civil marriage. But, mindful of the Church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have decided to put these considerations before any others.\"", "images":
