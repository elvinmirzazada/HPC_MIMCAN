She was sitting at one of their desks, fitting in not at all, using her phone, as they took their seats along with guests they brought to class that day \u2014 wives, mothers, boyfriends. Each seat filled, and some guests had to stand along the back wall and sit on the steps. The class was called the Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports. The students were there to interrogate Paltrow about Goop, her lifestyle-and-wellness e-commerce business, and to learn how to create a \u201csustainable competitive advantage,\u201d according to the class catalog.\n\nShe moved to the teacher\u2019s desk, where she sat down and crossed her legs. She talked about why she started the business, how she only ever wanted to be someone who recommended things. When she was in Italy, on the set of \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley,\u201d she\u2019d ask someone on the crew about, say, where the best gelato was. When she was in London, on the set of \u201cShakespeare in Love,\u201d she asked a crew member where to find the best coffee; in Paris, she asked an extra where to find the best bikini wax; in Berlin, the massage you can\u2019t miss. She wasn\u2019t just curious. She was planning this the whole time.\n\nThe first iteration of the company was only these lists \u2014 where to go and what to buy once you get there \u2014 via a newsletter she emailed out of her kitchen, the first one with recipes for turkey rag\u00f9 and banana-nut muffins. One evening, at a party in London, one of the newsletter\u2019s recipients, a venture capitalist named Juliet de Baubigny, told her, \u201cI love what you\u2019re doing with Goop.\u201d G.P., as she is called by nearly everyone in her employ, didn\u2019t even know what a venture capitalist was. She was using off-the-shelf newsletter software. But De Baubigny became a \u201cgodmother\u201d to Paltrow, she said. She encouraged her vision and \u201cgave permission\u201d to start thinking about how to monetize it.\n\nAt first, Goop \u2014 so named not just for her initials and for, you know, goop, but because someone along the way told her that all the successful internet companies had double O\u2019s \u2014 appealed to an audience that admired G.P.\u2019s rarefied lifestyle. Martha Stewart (for example) was an aspirational lifestyle brand, true, but the lifestyle was so easily attainable once Stewart took her wares to Kmart and Macy\u2019s.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/29/magazine/29mag-paltrow-slide-HG8U/29mag-paltrow-slide-HG8U-articleLarge.png?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/29/magazine/29mag-paltrow-slide-GNXX/29mag-paltrow-slide-GNXX-articleLarge.png?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/29/magazine/29mag-paltrow-slide-HG8U/29mag-paltrow-slide-HG8U-facebookJumbo.png?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=88c6ce792f0ebd25a2cc1da0e4080d60ae59cff7bbcb17813df55aa7ab7f06cb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/29/magazine/29mag-paltrow-slide-HG8U/29mag-paltrow-slide-HG8U-facebookJumbo.png?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=88c6ce792f0ebd25a2cc1da0e4080d60ae59cff7bbcb17813df55aa7ab7f06cb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taffy Brodesser-Akner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/magazine/big-business-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness.html", "title": "How Goop\u2019s Haters Made Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Company Worth $250 Million", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Inside the growth of the most controversial brand in the wellness industry.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/magazine/big-business-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness.html", "type": "article", "title": "How Goop\u2019s Haters Made Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Company Worth $250 Million (Published 2018)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/29/magazine/29mag-paltrow-slide-HG8U/29mag-paltrow-slide-HG8U-facebookJumbo.png?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=88c6ce792f0ebd25a2cc1da0e4080d60ae59cff7bbcb17813df55aa7ab7f06cb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "Gwyneth Paltrow."}, "description": "Inside the growth of the most controversial brand in the wellness industry."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/magazine/big-business-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness.html", "title": "How Goop\u2019s Haters Made Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Company Worth $250 Million (Published 2018)", "description": "Inside the growth of the most controversial brand in the wellness industry.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/29/magazine/29mag-paltrow-slide-HG8U/29mag-paltrow-slide-HG8U-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png?year=2018&h=899&w=1600&s=a68d5e3695321a59d6cdeccc8dffa022528ada63a1e5102bf8d8c2b1add15841&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "alt": "Gwyneth Paltrow."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/d871a606-a36f-5ba4-b7b8-1ffbdfd183fd"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-25T09:00:03.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-07-30T20:41:00.000Z", "section": "Magazine", "tag": "Women and Girls", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000006018598, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/d871a606-a36f-5ba4-b7b8-1ffbdfd183fd", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/4dd38de54ce5433f9d8bf245dc7f4e8f", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/29/magazine/29mag-paltrow-slide-HG8U/29mag-paltrow-slide-HG8U-facebookJumbo.png?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=88c6ce792f0ebd25a2cc1da0e4080d60ae59cff7bbcb17813df55aa7ab7f06cb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Taffy Brodesser-Akner", "news_keywords": "Gwyneth Paltrow,Goop.com,Women and Girls", "pdate": 20180725, "CG": "magazine", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/magazine/big-business-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/d871a606-a36f-5ba4-b7b8-1ffbdfd183fd", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/magazine/big-business-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/magazine/big-business-gwyneth-paltrow-wellness.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532466000.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
