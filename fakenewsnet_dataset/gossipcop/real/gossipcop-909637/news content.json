Nassar pleaded guilty in November to several counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.\n\nTeigen and Legend\u2019s donation came just days after Judge Rosemarie Aquilina of Michigan\u2019s Ingham County Circuit Court sentenced the 54-year-old to 40 to 175 years in prison for his crimes.\n\nTeigen has spoken out about the members of the USA women\u2019s gymnastics team before and had previously said she would be \u201cabsolutely honored\u201d to pay any fine Maroney would potentially face for breaking an NDA in order to testify at Nassar\u2019s trial.\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page. Learn more about Time\u2019s Up, an organization of women in entertainment combating sexual harassment and inequality, on its website.\n\n\u201cThe entire principle of this should be fought \u2013 an NDA to stay quiet about this serial monster with over 140 accusers, but I would be absolutely honored to pay this fine for you, McKayla.\u201d\n\nIn a statement obtained by PEOPLE earlier this month, USA Gymnastics revealed they had no plans to hold Maroney to her non-disclosure agreement, which had a penalty for violating its terms.\n\n\u201cUSA Gymnastics has not sought and will not seek any money from McKayla Maroney for her brave statements made in describing her victimization and abuse by Larry Nassar, nor for any victim impact statements she wants to make to Larry Nassar at this hearing or at any subsequent hearings related to his sentencing,\u201d USA Gymnastics said.\n\nThe organization added, \u201cThis has been her right and USA Gymnastics encourages McKayla and anyone who has been abused to speak out. USA Gymnastics remains focused on our highest priority \u2014 the safety, health and well-being of our athletes and creating a culture that empowers and supports them.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ex-USA Gymnastics Official Larry Nassar is Sentenced for Sexually Abusing Over 100 Young Women and Girls\n\nFollowing Nassar\u2019s sentencing, Raisman told PEOPLE that she didn\u2019t \u201cfeel like justice has been served,\u201d but she added, \u201cI don\u2019t even know if you ever feel justice, because it\u2019s never something you heal from. Abuse isn\u2019t just in the moment, it\u2019s for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nIn a statement last week, United States Olympic Committee officials issued an apology to Nassar\u2019s victims:\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this message is to tell all of Nassar\u2019s victims and survivors, directly, how incredibly sorry we are,\u201d CEO Scott Blackmun said in the statement. \u201cWe have said it in other contexts, but we have not been direct enough with you. We are sorry for the pain caused by this terrible man, and sorry that you weren\u2019t afforded a safe opportunity to pursue your sports dreams.\u201d\n\nCarlos Osorio/AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nIn a recent statement, USA Gymnastics officials said that they have \u201cand will continue to take specific and concrete steps to promote athlete safety, health and well-being and prevent future abuse by adopting and vigorously enforcing the USA Gymnastics Safe Sport Policy.\u201d USA Gymnastics entire board of directors resigned on Friday.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/IB0-ZwLrKg3YoHAHc654atvsR-s=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x704:721x706)/Angelina-Jolie-1-7260e3e29de9428499f8176a62b2db6e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/b9naSSQkKHRLqCg1-O9uysrWRqA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x0:676x2)/Athlete_A_Vertical_Main_RGB_PRE-2000-bf4b2fe7c78c4f61b8106f1334a97fb0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/P59gT3-_teY9tEZQL1C9vIkmiwo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x539:961x541)/deshaun-watson-1-cbf35b004eed42e3854e244605e1e242.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hi3nXudy9SCVLHTlY5LeTA_Suxg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Robert-Griswold-of-Team-United-States-celebrates-winning-the-gold-medal-20210903_51-c250574d9a7843e8a67daf6d8ac0934e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/6w65LHd9MjJN0Ts3y6F1bVyLcXU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x22:941x24)/Oscar-De-La-Hoya-1-2c07e25b36e740c1b01894cd602c559c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/54ct30pAAfdL399DQzcMvs-Y3s4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/mel-gibson-16fe701901ac428eb49552305f3c689e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/PYkC3L1IAp0qKkKJvB0oqgZghkY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/larry-nassar-1-2000-5f49d38c342c4107b031603c1fade4f2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/pfEqNOIyXGc9-IZYMbbpF161u_4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/john-legend4-2000-ab084a39382747dfb08ebcc1e0365acd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tY12XvcAFOHCsBIMuaXQ0ucdxAs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x9:676x11)/Deshaun-Watson-d768f7c14fd84e84920e30600f5e062c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/c3NnYQ2Iv_CT6395u34gTsiecBs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(408x0:410x2)/chrissy-teigen9-1-d47b6affad124eb7a3151fc7dfde3178.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4yw721TpKd8Uviu3qOMcNYjixKk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Simone-Aly-McKayla-Maggie-court-1a9760f270c440d2add6ecb996a2e175.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/UVtj-wRPAaD7HWg6x7aSCC_6SJY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x452:981x454)/ashton-kutcher-danny-masterson-013123-9c84cd0de491403ebc9d43eb86ae5faa.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/LsKxRQkSPTIH_foYstMgKN9C1K8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/danny-masterson1-2000-3b2e3319463f4cf5a2e9977ebff17148.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/_9uOJgkOl6QS-VUZjvykx5-LxnM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/simone-biles-hearing-4411203f7c0649f596acc17932d4d868.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Vo81GfVdzD1VQVSXffATykRFSeE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(598x0:600x2)/Aly-Raisman63-4acf7645945e4726b312e53cbc0213c3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/CChG9jk7_aLP9it6xfZ-1W945fM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(794x419:796x421)/Gerald-Allen-Sutter-102722-b0f15c2eed364b069e9fb019f8657e10.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zR4hsXWn08-KlOeeBa_6JPv31sM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(649x0:651x2)/larry-nassar-guilty-sexual-assault-2dca2ee1d8304b34bbbbb77156843eac.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hayogwZHfp4w4dIkl8HjP3xaqGs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/tony-awards14-794062d308e14116b366f133c5418e4b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/W2CR3zgWEMqQkEcqNiHbL9A9Px0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(517x193:519x195)/McKayla-Maroney-1-cfbacb99fe3d4ea2b7f61770031a2ad2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/pfEqNOIyXGc9-IZYMbbpF161u_4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/john-legend4-2000-ab084a39382747dfb08ebcc1e0365acd.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Staff Editor For Human Interest S Digital Vertical At People.
