These three accusations are the latest of several against Piven, who has been accused of actions ranging from following one woman into a trailer on the set of a movie to attempting to force himself on another woman in a hotel room.\n\nSusan McCain Olson was an extra on the set of Lucas, Piven\u2019s very first film, in 1985, when she claims Piven followed her into another actor\u2019s trailer and pushed her down on the couch, trying to kiss her and put his hands up her shirt. \u201cAt one point I kind of was like, \u2018This is it, this is where I\u2019m going to get raped,\u2019\u201d McCain Olson told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI kept trying to push him away. I was like, \u2018No, get off me.\u2019\u201d She says she eventually was able to get him to leave, and decided not to tell anyone about the incident at the time because she was \u201cjust an extra\u201d and didn\u2019t want to lose her job. Three of McCain Olson\u2019s friends and her fianc\u00e9 confirmed to BuzzFeed News that she had told them about the incident.\n\nAnother woman who asked not to be identified in the report told BuzzFeed about an incident that allegedly happened a few years later, around 1994, in which she met Piven while he was filming a movie in Canada and made plans to show him around town, being clear that she wasn\u2019t interested in anything romantic. On the appointed day, she says, she arrived at his hotel and was told by the front desk to go up to his room. She says when she got inside he immediately pinned her against the wall and tried to kiss her, after which she pushed him off. She claims she asked him what he thought he was doing, and he asked her what she came up to his room for. She left. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to stick around to find out what else was going to happen,\u201d she said.\n\nPiven and his lawyers released a statement saying that they deny all of the allegations. \u201cThese allegations, which in one case goes back more than 30 years and the two others more than 20 years ago, are false. As evidenced by the lie detector test I took and passed, I have never forced myself on anyone, nor have I ever exposed myself or restrained anyone against their will. To the contrary, if any woman ever said no, I stopped.\u201d\n\nEight women in total have now accused Piven of sexual misconduct.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654e7633af2b6948a8bc9b23/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6564cb9e766ac2eb76f98953/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654e4d03cccb5e3c25b703ad/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a57e192eeb4e84c14cd38ab/1:1/pass/Dan-Harmon-Apologizes-for-Sexual-Harassment.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660159ee60bb2d438ba5ff/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6556b35b8a4978fa73f64ce1/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655b86aa9a606599b488689d/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a04c00a53badd5c35dd9abf/1:1/pass/Piven-Accusal.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6126c3fee89c27f99f5957/1:1/pass/Michael-Douglas-Sexual-Harassment-Allegations.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6e13f73d90f30e7df80c45/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/jeremy-piven-sexual-misconduct.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6560d381298066ecc754d7bb/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6558d7df15b11fe27e4a7f93/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6553f2e660d80e2627df6aeb/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/656510d0affa7b4408631071/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6e13f73d90f30e7df80c45/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jeremy-piven-sexual-misconduct.png"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6e13f73d90f30e7df80c45/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jeremy-piven-sexual-misconduct.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Emma Stefansky"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/jeremy-piven-three-more-women-sexual-misconduct", "title": "Three More Women Accuse Jeremy Piven of Sexual Misconduct", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "The former Entourage star denies the allegations.", "id": "5a6e0460d9af304b6eb1c5a7", "keywords": "jeremy piven,sexual misconduct", "news_keywords": "jeremy piven,sexual misconduct", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a6e0460d9af304b6eb1c5a7", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The former Entourage star denies the allegations.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6e13f73d90f30e7df80c45/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/jeremy-piven-sexual-misconduct.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6e13f73d90f30e7df80c45/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/jeremy-piven-sexual-misconduct.png\"}", "og": {"description": "The former Entourage star denies the allegations.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6e13f73d90f30e7df80c45/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jeremy-piven-sexual-misconduct.png", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Three More Women Accuse Jeremy Piven of Sexual Misconduct", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/jeremy-piven-three-more-women-sexual-misconduct"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-01-28T19:35:39.330Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-28T19:35:39.330Z", "author": "Emma Stefansky"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The former Entourage star denies the allegations.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6e13f73d90f30e7df80c45/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jeremy-piven-sexual-misconduct.png?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Three More Women Accuse Jeremy Piven of Sexual Misconduct"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6e13f73d90f30e7df80c45/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/jeremy-piven-sexual-misconduct.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517168139.33, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
