And soon we\u2019ll see how the duo performs on a permanent basis.\n\nIn five episodes as a fill-in, the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d alum has averaged a 2.56 Nielsen TV rating. That\u2019s good enough to rank him 20th among the many (67, to be exact) whom \u201cLive With Kelly\u201d tried out over the past 12 months.\n\nBelow are a few folks who have done even better than the guy who\u2019d like to forget his time on Fox\u2019s \u201cKnock Knock Live.\u201d\n\nRank: 19\n\nCo-Host: Anderson Cooper\n\nNo. of Episodes: 11\n\nAverage Rating: 2.564\n\nRank: 17\n\nCo-Host: Mark Consuelos\n\nNo. of Episodes: 10\n\nAverage Rating: 2.58\n\nRank: 9\n\nCo-Host: Jussie Smollett\n\nNo. of Episodes: 4\n\nAverage Rating: 2.725\n\nIn Seacrest\u2019s case, it certainly didn\u2019t hurt that the popular radio personality only guest co-hosted the show five times and hasn\u2019t appeared since February. (He did three of his episodes in November, and the other one last June.) Had he stopped by more often and more recently, Seacrest may have fallen victim to organically declining interest levels, and thus, fewer eyeballs. You\u2019ll see what we mean in the gallery, where the top dogs only showed up once or twice \u2014 and generally not very long after Michael Strahan quit.\n\nClick here to see how every single guest co-hosted episode of \u201cLive With Kelly\u201d has done since Jimmy Kimmel kicked off the run almost 12 full months ago. And go here to see the Nielsen averages for each individual member of the year-long tryout.\n\nScroll through our gallery below to see every single man and woman who had higher Nielsen averages guest co-hosting \u201cLive With Kelly\u201d than Seacrest did.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Sherri-Shepherd.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/macys-thanksgiving-parade-2023.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tony-Maglio.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tony-Maglio.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nathan-fielder-emma-stone.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ai-2014-ryan-seacrest.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/NCIS-Sydney.jpeg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ai-2014-ryan-seacrest.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ai-2014-ryan-seacrest.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tony Maglio", "Sharon Knolle", "Adam Chitwood", "Loree Seitz", "Tv Editor", "Tony.Maglio Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/ryan-seacrest-kelly-ripa-co-hosts-better-ratings/", "title": "Ryan Seacrest Got the Job at \u2018Live With Kelly,\u2019 But Here Are 19 Co-Hosts Who Got Better Ratings", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ryan Seacrest Got the Job at 'Live With Kelly,' But Here Are 19 Co-Hosts Who Got Better Ratings - TheWrap", "description": "Heck, her husband did better than this guy", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/ryan-seacrest-kelly-ripa-co-hosts-better-ratings/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ai-2014-ryan-seacrest.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-05-01T18:30:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-01T20:09:37+00:00"}, "author": "Tony Maglio", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Tony Maglio", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Ryan Seacrest Got the Job at \u2018Live With Kelly,\u2019 But Here Are 19 Co-Hosts Who Got Better Ratings", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/ryan-seacrest-kelly-ripa-co-hosts-better-ratings/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-05-01T11:30:56-07:00", "parsely-section": "news", "parsely-author": "Tony Maglio", "parsely-tags": "kelly_ripa, ryan_seacrest", "article-tags": "kelly_ripa, ryan_seacrest}", "article-section": "news", "article-categories": "news, ratings, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493663456.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
