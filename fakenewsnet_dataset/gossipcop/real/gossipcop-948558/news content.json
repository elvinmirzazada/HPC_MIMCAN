It was my own ignorance, and there\u2019s no excuse for that ignorance,\u201d she continued.\n\nBecoming tearful, she added, \u201cI definitely feel remorse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ask people if you look at my tweet don\u2019t defend me. I\u2019ve done something egregious and I don\u2019t want to be defended. I don\u2019t want to get any more racism going from what I did, I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want to be defended\u201d she explained.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/nzTidM45HXM-wZDqFo7BSk4MWok=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(989x289:991x291)/The-Bachelor-Finale-01-032223-5511b023e2a3446cad95a82af6795f6c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/5FfKL0FMLX3P1Rg02_eZguBkjoQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/chris-harrison-rachel-lindsay-ff051e5f0dc44510b0b4979c59e4738c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/WDHDkF1FG-3YL_hywEcdim4pkE4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x359:676x361)/Bachelor-Greer-Blitzer-01-012423-ebf5253f8ec04e2ab06308b116f708c6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/kjTmM_Rc69pYR1MWa7JuqHzsIGs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(807x0:809x2)/gettyimages-937178142-2000-62db77926cc54f22a169a6ef96751da1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4-dtqSJWUJ0_vv3PLdTi1332Fr4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(374x339:376x341)/Howard-Stern-Kanye-West-101922-54e0d67e05f843769b9d63088c52c9d2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/QUA5zWnsnuS4PIoBUleoHAe7mhY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/roseanne-2-1-2000-52fbc9ca95734b09b2b5551f241dd5c6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ocfWdZ2XGiA6kwPWO4cC7tPVJ_8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(577x0:579x2)/taylor-nolan-2-2000-85d1380ad2d74bd6a15310c30bb6be16.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/5oCxa1hoX6a2OPwXN5V7hKrjbXs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/lea-michele-012623-1da5de876480411aa3c888e42166a66b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/wG9aIPaFvFhTIhICYD1au1ckYsQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x179:706x181)/jesse-palmer-bachelor-020223-546139a2975a4bf5ba2a64c685e149a0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8vzWckmn09GsTP-Hd0qs-ZWuo3g=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(489x224:491x226)/michael-fishman-leaving-the-conners-082922-1-30f484d23c0749379319ec37b7bb4129.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Bc6ekHYjnk4Lp5Fj9vE6cjLA-Rw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/ariana-madix-tom-sandoval-raquel-leviss-052423-1-74cdc6938ea149a3b924e51100753146.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/oxCJyuhpUXaEw3HASS5GF6uHQLI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x369:721x371)/chris-harrison-9faf4bf93643412d818ed17419cb63b5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/wt5pDo-hC9mW_asxrRn3bJXi6-o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(499x0:501x2)/GettyImages-1285187291-d08aa1a174e24269a1677b495592d72e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/udssZlaCFV2XM9d7PlJi7EsMH9E=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/emmanuel-acho-1-ae8695139dbc4631b7990759568ab35d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/bAhwOit1WdXkiruOo-d9ByZBzBE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/rachel-lindsay-chris-harrison-f74dde97fd4d48dc9dc4039505d9e8ac.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/bFb5zfaRxTX46twMFPnSndaiT8o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x19:751x21)/bachelor-greer-031423-2-9df9ecab4f1a46168b7c7e68306286a9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/AYeSdk4OIYcF9ubzzCfVJY4kUqE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(859x532:861x534)/Whoopie-goldberg-100222-2000-e5b196ad83774cfa94a9f6333897d061.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/kjTmM_Rc69pYR1MWa7JuqHzsIGs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(807x0:809x2)/gettyimages-937178142-2000-62db77926cc54f22a169a6ef96751da1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Staff Editor For Human Interest S Digital Vertical At People.
