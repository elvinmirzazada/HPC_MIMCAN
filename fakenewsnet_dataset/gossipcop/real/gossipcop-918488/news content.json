{"url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-finale-arie-luyendyk-chooses-between-lauren-becca/", "text": "Bachelor Nation, we made it to the finish line.\n\nOn Monday\u2019s three-hour season finale, Arie Luyendyk Jr., 36, made his final choice between publicist Becca Kufrin, 27, and sales executive Lauren Burnham, 26 \u2014 but how he came to his decision was unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before.\n\nSPOILER WARNING: The following contains major spoilers from Monday\u2019s finale. Read on at your own risk.\n\nThe final week of dates opens in Cusco, Peru, where Arie is still torn between his finalists. Making the situation even stickier is the fact that he\u2019s told both women he loves them \u2014 but neither of them knows he\u2019s also professed his love to the other.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in love with Becca and I\u2019m in love with Lauren, and I told them both that I love them \u2014 so I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m going to deal with that,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of all this, I have to break someone\u2019s heart. And that makes that decision very tough.\u201d\n\nOn the one hand, there\u2019s Becca. She\u2019s been a frontrunner from the beginning \u2014 landing the first one-on-one date of the season \u2014 and their relationship has remained solid throughout.\n\n\u201cWith Becca, I know who she is,\u201d explains Arie. \u201cShe\u2019s laid all the cards out on the table. She\u2019s got great values, she loves her family, she\u2019s funny and goofy and sexy at the same time. It\u2019s so comfortable with her. I don\u2019t really have any worries about us after this, and that really gives me a lot of comfort.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Lauren. One of four Laurens cast this season, she\u2019s been one of the most quiet and reserved contestants this franchise has ever seen \u2014 but all along, Arie has been drawn to her.\n\n\u201cWith Lauren, there\u2019s a little bit more of a risk just because I feel like through this whole thing she\u2019s been so reserved,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were always these intense feelings, from the moment I met her, and I was sort of peeling back these layers of someone and figuring them out. But I can see how much she loves me, and that gives me a lot of confidence.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Bachelor\u2018s Caroline Goes After Arie During Women Tell All \u2014 \u2018I Know What You Did\u2019\n\nLAUREN MEETS THE PARENTS\n\nArie\u2019s family travels to Peru to help guide him through the decision. He introduces them to Lauren first, and his main concern is that she\u2019s going to be shy and closed off. Though things get off to a slightly stilted start, Lauren eventually manages to win the family over, even shedding a few tears with Arie\u2019s mom.\n\n\u201cI would think she\u2019s the one,\u201d says Arie\u2019s mom. \u201cBut maybe tomorrow we\u2019ll think Becca is the one.\u201d\n\nBECCA MEETS THE PARENTS\n\nThe very next day, it\u2019s Becca\u2019s turn. Even though the family definitely takes a liking to her, the misfortune of going second means being inevitably compared to the first woman \u2014 and Arie\u2019s family certainly doesn\u2019t gloss over the awkwardness of the situation. Instead, they openly and repeatedly bring Lauren up, which shakes Becca.\n\n\u201cArie\u2019s dad said he would be happy with either one of us \u2014 that wasn\u2019t fun to hear at all,\u201d she admits later. \u201cLauren and I are so different. It\u2019s like trying to compare an apple to a starfish. And I don\u2019t want to be compared to her in any way, because she\u2019s still a huge threat to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear to God, if I have to hear the name Lauren one more time, I\u2019m going to lose it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me want to puke thinking about them together. I hate talking about Lauren.\u201d\n\nAfter Becca leaves, Arie regroups with his family to discuss how things went. They loved both girls and don\u2019t exactly think there\u2019s a \u201cwrong choice\u201d \u2014 but ultimately, they all swayed toward Becca.\n\n\u201cI love Lauren \u2014 but I think Becca would be better for your future,\u201d says Arie\u2019s mom. \u201cBecause I think you have to reassure Lauren all the time about your love, and Becca stands on her own.\u201d\n\nFINAL DATE WITH LAUREN\n\nThe morning of his very last date with Lauren, Arie wakes up having more or less made up his mind about picking Becca \u2014 but after spending the day exploring Machu Picchu with Lauren, everything gets turned upside down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard because I thought I really had my feeling sorted out, but today Lauren has found her way into my heart,\u201d he says. \u201cLauren\u2019s amazing. I can tell you that she has a little speckle on her left eye, and there are just little things about her that I find so endearing and sweet and amazing. It\u2019s crazy to think I could say goodbye to someone like that.\u201d\n\nPaul Hebert/ABC\n\nPaul Hebert/ABC\n\nOn their final evening together, Lauren makes a point to lay all her cards out on the table.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so in love with you,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of anything. I\u2019m so excited and I\u2019m ready to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d\n\nThey spend the next few hours cuddling on the couch, envisioning their future together and wondering whether their dogs will get along. Arie provides constant reassurance to Lauren, telling her how much he loves her over and over again \u2014 and in her mind, she\u2019s got this in the bag.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Arie would have let me tell him all of those things about how much I care about him and talk about our future all day if he knew he was picking Becca,\u201d she says.\n\nAs for Arie? He seems pretty sold on Lauren at this point, too.\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve ever wanted from her since the moment I fell in love with her,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had to propose this second, it would be her, right now. Lauren could be my wife. I feel really good about us, and I love her.\u201d\n\nFINAL DATE WITH BECCA\n\nAfter an emotionally charged day with Lauren, Arie heads right into his last date with Becca. They spend the day exploring Cusco, shopping and taking in the sights. And even though he seemed so confident in his decision mere hours ago, he flip-flops once again.\n\n\u201cGoing into today, I was just thinking about Lauren \u2014 but now I\u2019m conflicted,\u201d he admits. \u201cAfter spending the day with Becca, it really reminded me of all of her amazing qualities and why I was so attracted to her from the beginning.\u201d\n\nPaul Hebert/ABC\n\nPaul Hebert/ABC\n\nBecca, meanwhile, is also feeling uncertain \u2014 and begins to speculate that Arie might be equally in love with Lauren.\n\n\u201cI feel like Lauren is everything he\u2019s probably dated in the past,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to go with something that he\u2019s more used to \u2014 or me, who I think would challenge him a lot more and really want an equal partnership. I can\u2019t picture my future without him. Losing him in one day, to somebody who is so different than I am, to me right now is unimaginable.\u201d\n\nPaul Hebert/ABC\n\nThat night, Becca brings up some of her fears to Arie. While he confesses that he\u2019s conflicted in his decision, he still ends up providing her with constant reassurance, repeatedly telling her how much he loves her. And when Becca surprises him with a scrapbook of their journey together, he\u2019s clearly overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in love with Becca, and tonight I could really feel how much she loved me and how much she wanted us,\u201d he says. \u201cI needed today to really help me make this decision \u2014 and I really realized Becca could be my wife.\u201d\n\nWatching Arie bounce back and forth between both women is exhausting, even just as a viewer \u2014 but it\u2019s also weighing heavily on Arie himself, especially considering he only has one night to make up his mind before the proposal.\n\n\u201cTomorrow I have to make the biggest decision of my life and I\u2019m struggling,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019m in love with two women and I just don\u2019t know what to do. Both Becca and Lauren feel good about our relationships, and that\u2019s my fault, because I said \u2018I love you\u2019 to both of them. It makes me feel guilty, because the hardest breakups are the breakups you don\u2019t see coming.\u201d\n\nTHE BUILDUP\n\nBy the next morning, Arie claims to have made up his mind for once and for all.\n\n\u201cThese two relationships are very different, these two women are very different, and so I had to look inward and see what\u2019s important,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I finally realize who I can see myself growing old with. It feels so good to have that clarity. I couldn\u2019t have pictured a better women for me.\u201d\n\nHe picks out a ring with famed jeweler Neil Lane \u2014 and braces himself for what\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting engaged today. On the one hand, this is the best day of my life,\u201d he reflects. \u201cBut on the other hand, it kills me inside to know that I\u2019m going to have to say goodbye to someone that I\u2019m in love with. She\u2019s not going to see this coming.\u201d\n\nTHE BREAKUP\n\nFinally, the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for: At the bottom of a hill, Arie anxiously awaits the arrival of his runner-up \u2026 and out of the limo comes Lauren.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through that breakup and I think the one thing you want is answers on why,\u201d Arie says as she makes her way towards him. \u201cI want to tell her something that could really help her through this, but I have no real reason to give her.\u201d\n\nMaking matters even worse is the fact that Lauren is fully expecting a proposal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very excited and I don\u2019t have any doubts,\u201d she gushes. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine him not proposing to me today. He makes me feel very safe, and he loves me in a way I\u2019ve never known. I think Arie and I have a connection that\u2019s far beyond anything most people even have in their lifetime. It\u2019s just something so special and so rare \u2014 I do feel like he is my one true love.\u201d\n\nPaul Hebert/ABC\n\nOnce she gets to him, she takes his hands in hers and launches into her speech. Arie, clearly emotional, finally shakes his head to stop her.\n\n\u201cI was awake all night thinking about this moment,\u201d he tells her. \u201cAnd I wanted it so bad for us. But there was something that was holding me back, and I just can\u2019t go through with it. It\u2019s not anything that I can explain other than that I gave it everything I had to see if it could work. I did fall in love with you.\u201d\n\nLauren is utterly speechless, and, in her own words, \u201cextremely confused.\u201d In silence and hand-in-hand, they make their way to the top of the hill, where a black SUV is waiting to whisk her away.\n\n\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d she finally asks him.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know, fully, until this morning,\u201d he says. \u201cI was in love with her, I was in love with you. I\u2019m sorry to put you through this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still love you,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he responds.\n\nAnd just like that, the car door slams shut. She\u2019s gone, and Arie is left to face the consequences of his actions.\n\n\u201cI feel a little bit like a monster right now,\u201d he says. \u201cAll I really wanted to tell Lauren was \u2018I love you.\u2019 But I\u2019m saying goodbye.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel betrayed,\u201d Lauren, in tears, says as she\u2019s driven away. \u201cI mean, how could you do that to somebody? I don\u2019t get it. He just completely blindsided me. I let my guard down, I let someone in, and it still didn\u2019t work out. I wholeheartedly believed that he was going to be the one. I was wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he\u2019s in love with me and he\u2019s in love with her and he had no idea what he was going to do until this morning,\u201d she continues, still reeling. \u201cDid that not terrify him? How can you get down on one knee if you weren\u2019t sure until like, three hours ago? I really think he made a mistake.\u201d\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nABC\n\nAfter witnessing such a brutal breakup, it\u2019s hard to imagine that Arie would be able to propose to someone else just minutes later. But even though he looks visibly shaken, somehow, he still goes through with it.\n\n\u201cWhen I met you, I was taken aback,\u201d he says to Becca. \u201cYou are beautiful and elegant and in that first conversation, I knew that you were an incredible woman. I think back on our dates and I think back on meeting your family and I think back on all the moments that we shared, and the thing that stands out is that we\u2019re a team. I am very lucky that you\u2019ve been on this journey with me, and through all of it, you\u2019ve given me so much confidence along the way. Because of that, my love for you is immeasurable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis morning, I woke up and I thought about you,\u201d he continues, getting down on one knee. \u201cI thought about you and our kids together, I thought about us when we\u2019re old, and I choose you today. But I choose you every day from here on out. I love you so much. Becca, will you marry me?\u201d\n\nPaul Hebert/ABC\n\nBecca, of course, says yes, and he slides the ring on her finger. As the camera pans out, they\u2019re the ultimate picture-perfect couple, newly engaged, kissing and twirling each other around in the Peruvian countryside.\n\n\u201cRebecca Jill Kufrin Luyendyk,\u201d she squeals to the camera. \u201cIt\u2019s got a ring to it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen are we going to start having babies?\u201d he asks, turning to face her.\n\n\u201cTonight?\u201d she suggests. \u201cI\u2019m the happiest girl in the world right now. What is life?!\u201d\n\nTHE CHANGE OF HEART\n\nWhat is life, indeed. While a usual Bachelor finale ends there, Arie\u2019s journey did not. What happens next is equal parts fascinating, twisted, and, quite simply, brutal. First, we\u2019re privy to a montage of footage Becca and Arie filmed after taping their November engagement in Peru. We witness them kissing, goofing around making pizza, playing chess \u2014 from the outside, they seem like a blissful, newly engaged pair.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re enjoying our time \u2014 alone,\u201d Arie says in one shot as the two cuddle in a hammock.\n\n\u201cAlone and in love,\u201d adds Becca.\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d says Arie. \u201cIt feels good, and we love everyone and we want to say thank you. This journey has been amazing.\u201d\n\nBut behind closed doors, Arie is wrestling with his decision.\n\n\u201cSometimes when I\u2019m on these little getaways with Becca I think about, What would this be like with Lauren?\u201d he admits. \u201cIt just kills me, because I have a great woman next to me. I go to bed and I think about Lauren. I wake up and I think about Lauren. And I know Becca sees when I struggle. She sees the fact that my mind is somewhere else. She knows that I think about Lauren.\u201d\n\nArie explains that he thought his feelings for Lauren would have subsided over time \u2014 except they didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWith Becca, I just feel an immense amount of guilt,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair for her to be in a relationship where someone is half in. I told Becca that I would choose her every day. I know I made that commitment, and it kills me that I\u2019m going back on that. But I have to follow my heart.\u201d\n\nAnd in case there was any doubt about what that meant, Arie lays it out for us, plain and simple: He\u2019s decided to call off the engagement and break up with Becca.\n\n\u201cJust thinking about the possibility of something with Lauren is making me want to risk it all,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I really feel like I made a mistake. I\u2019ve had a change of heart. Look, I know this isn\u2019t going to be a popular decision. But it\u2019s worth it to me. I\u2019m doing it because I love Lauren.\u201d\n\nAt this point, however, Becca was completely unaware of Arie\u2019s plans to end things \u2014 which makes what happens next even more painful. One weekend in mid-January, Becca shows up at a house in Los Angeles, where she thinks she\u2019s going to get to spend a \u201chappy couple\u201d weekend with Arie. There\u2019s a camera crew, and she clearly assumes they\u2019re taping some sort of post-finale special.\n\n\u201cThe past few months have been such a whirlwind,\u201d she gushes. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would leave The Bachelor an engaged woman, but I\u2019m so excited. I can see a future so clearly with Arie. I really just want to get to the point where the show is done and we can finally start our life together. I miss him when I\u2019m not with him!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s excruciating to watch, really. While she waits for Arie to arrive, she happily shows off the huge ring \u2014 \u201che did very well with the selection,\u201d she says, beaming.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Arie Luyendyk Jr. Says He Fell for Two Women on the Show \u2014 \u2018I Didn\u2019t Know I Was Capable of That\u2019\n\nFinally, Arie shows up and nervously shuffles Becca over to the couch. A crew scrambles to set up cameras on both sides of the room to capture every second of the conversation, from all angles. From there, we get to watch a split screen of the entire agonizing confrontation.\n\n\u201cHow do I start this?\u201d Arie begins, looking visibly uncomfortable. \u201cYou know that I\u2019ve been struggling a little bit. I think over the last couple of times we\u2019ve been hanging out, I\u2019ve been really trying to sort my feelings out and trying to grasp this whole thing. The reality of it is that being with you, although it\u2019s been everything that I wanted, I still think about her. I think you sense that.\u201d\n\nAs Becca sits in silence, Arie tries to justify his decision, explaining that the longer he stays with Becca, the more he feels like his window of opportunity for reconciliation with Lauren is narrowing.\n\n\u201cSo what? Do you want to be back with her?\u201d Becca asks.\n\n\u201cI want to see if there\u2019s that possibility,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAre you f\u2014ing kidding me?\u201d she responds.\n\nABC\n\nIt\u2019s the first outburst of emotion Becca shows. Throughout the whole exchange, she\u2019s actually relatively composed \u2014 though it\u2019s obvious her silence isn\u2019t due to a lack of anger, but rather due to the fact that she\u2019s deeply mortified at the way this is all unfolding.\n\nFrom here on out, it doesn\u2019t get any better. It becomes apparent that Lauren has indeed been an issue in their relationship and Arie has already had some sort of \u201cconversation\u201d with her, though it\u2019s unclear when or under what circumstances. At one point, Becca calls Arie out for leading her to believe he wasn\u2019t serious about Lauren.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything that you told me about her, your relationship with her \u2014 you flat-out said you couldn\u2019t see a future with her, you couldn\u2019t quantify why you fell in love with her. Was that just words to me? You said you still had feelings for her that you were struggling with and I was trying to do what I could to help you. What did I do wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d responds Arie. \u201cYou were extremely patient with me, you allowed me to work through those feelings. I didn\u2019t really let you know to the extent.\u201d\n\nIn between long, painful silences, Becca eventually becomes resigned to the fact that it\u2019s over. She takes off her ring and tells him he should never have gotten down on one knee in the first place, then gets up and retreats to the bathroom to cry. Arie awkwardly follows her from room to room until she gives in and sits back down on the couch with him.\n\n\u201cI feel like my future was ripped away,\u201d she says, crying. \u201cLike, I love you. I obviously want you to be happy, and it\u2019s not me. I can\u2019t imagine my life without you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted those things for us, too,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I just can\u2019t give those to you if I\u2019m in love with someone else. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry we\u2019re here right now.\u201d\n\nFinally, after what feels like hours, she tells him to leave for once and for all. He obliges, and Becca is left crying and shaking on the couch, curled over in a puddle of tears.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the last we saw of her: After the episode concluded, franchise host Chris Harrison brought Becca out on stage in front of the live studio audience to share her thoughts. The first word that came to mind?\n\n\u201cBrutal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s brutal. I mean, when it all happened I feel like I kind of blacked out and so much was going through my mind that I couldn\u2019t take it all in or really focus on even what I wanted to say. To watch that back now, of course I had feelings for him and I loved him, so it\u2019s a hard heartbreak. \u2026 I was ready to do it all.\u201d\n\nShe also revealed that she and Arie haven\u2019t interacted since that day.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter he left, I went through all the motions. I was sad, I stayed in L.A. for a few days and cried for probably four days straight and grieved the loss of that relationship and the future that I thought were were going to have. I am angry at times, I feel betrayed a lot of the time just because I feel like I was lied to for so long.\u201d\n\nAs for what she has to say to him?\n\n\u201cI have a ton of questions,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at this point, it\u2019s like, anything I ask him \u2014 will I get a true answer?\u201d\n\nWe won\u2019t know the outcome of Arie\u2019s relationship with Lauren until Tuesday, when The Bachelor concludes with a two-hour live After the Final Rose special, starting at 8 p.m. ET on ABC. One thing\u2019s for sure, though: Arie, you\u2019ve got a lot of explaining to do.", "images":
