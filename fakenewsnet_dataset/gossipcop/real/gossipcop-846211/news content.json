Babies have been born, the rapper signed a major deal with Adidas, thus causing Yeezy to grow exponentially, the reality star founded KKW Beauty, and that just seems to scratch the surface.\n\nLast year Kardashian walked solo on the carpet, and that might be a possibility again at the forthcoming soiree on Monday.\n\nFN is taking a look back at the couple\u2019s bold looks from the fashion gala through the years.\n\nIn 2016, the duo dressed in head-turning futuristic Balmain ensembles for the event, which was themed \u201cManus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cLife of Pablo\u201d artist donned an oversized bling-embellished trucker jacket from the French fashion house, ripped Fear of God Jeans and suede tan Saint Laurent boots complete with light blue contact lenses.\n\nMeanwhile, the mom of three styled silver metallic T-strap sandals courtesy of Tom Ford with her sparkling Balmain number featuring a dangerously high slit.\n\nThe year prior, the couple rocked his-and-hers custom Roberto Cavalli by Peter Dundas gear. Kim wore a nude beaded gown boasting an open back and a long white feathered trai, while West showed off a burgundy velvet tuxedo with a matching velvet kimono shirt and scarf embroidered with burgundy silk threading.\n\nIn 2014, the pair toned things down a bit with both donning elegant Lanvin designs. West looked dapper in a black tux with a white shirt sans bow tie and patent leather lace-up boots. The makeup mogul was dressed in a black and navy strapless gown with a thigh-high slit and black T-strap pumps.\n\nFor their first Met Gala appearance as a couple, Kim and Kanye repped Givenchy creations. Kardashian, who was pregnant with their first daughter, North West, at the time, modeled a floral high-neck gown and matching sandals, while the \u201cStronger\u201d rapper wore a classic black tux and matching patent leather shoes.\n\nFor more of the Kardashians and Jenners at the Met Gala through the years, check out the gallery.\n\nWant more?\n\nAdidas CEO Speaks Out About Kanye West\u2019s Controversial Slavery Comments\n\nKanye West Gets Candid on Nike, Twitter & Politics in New InterviewKim Kardashian Throws Chrissy Teigen Surprise Baby Shower", "images": ["https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lori-harvey-renaissance-premiere.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/K-Swiss-pickleball-four.jpg?w=1800&h=1040&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/baby2baby-gala-guests.jpg?w=1800&h=1042&crop=1", "https://sourcingjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AetrexHeeluxeFitStarter.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/hoka-mach-supersonic.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/summer-sandal-lead.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1465280448.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-and-kanye-met-gala-2016.png?w=1024&h=683&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/puma-suede-sneaker-beavis-butt-head-photos.jpg?w=1200&h=710&crop=1", "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1777281369-e1701289656546.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jessica-web-cover-1.jpg", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-met-gala-2015.jpg", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-met-gala-2016.jpg", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-and-kanye-met-gala-2016.png", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-met-gala-2014.jpg", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kith-birkenstock-london-braided-001.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jessica-web-cover-1.jpg?w=244", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kimkanye3.jpg", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Best-Running-Shoes-Plantar-Fasciitis-Lead.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/victorias-secret-the-icon-photos-01-photo-feature-emrata.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/journeys-store.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/kim-kardashian-baby-baby-gala-main.jpg?w=1800&h=1042&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1529363335-1.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/marrakech-ff-tilda-swinton.jpg?w=1800&h=1042&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1254881113.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/katie-holmes-nyc-boots.jpg?w=1800&h=1042&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dr-Martens-Jadon-Boot-10th-Anniversary.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Taraji-P.-Henson-SAG-five.jpg?w=1800&h=1040&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-and-kanye-met-gala-2016.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allie Fasanella"], "canonical_link": "https://footwearnews.com/fashion/celebrity-style/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-met-gala-best-red-carpet-looks-1202558699/", "title": "Kanye West and Kim Kardashian\u2019s Best Looks at the Met Gala Through the Years", "meta_data": {"description": "FN is taking a look back at some of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's boldest Met Gala red carpet looks, since their couple debut in 2013.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "author": "Allie Fasanella", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202558699, "title": "Kanye West and Kim Kardashian\u2019s Best Looks at the Met Gala Through the Years", "published_at": "2018-05-06 10:30:06", "image": "https://footwearnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-and-kanye-met-gala-2016.png?w=300&h=225&crop=1", "comment_count": 0, "topics": "Met Gala", "body": "A lot has happened\u00a0since Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's Met Gala red carpet debut together in 2013.
