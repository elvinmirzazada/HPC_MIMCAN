An orchestra guy, that's who -- an orchestra guy who used to constantly, \"accidentally\" text both Stone and Lawrence.\n\n\"He wasn't really a stalker. He's just this guy who has a lot of people's phone numbers,\" Stone said in an interview for W's Best Performances feature. \"He must have worked at a studio or something.\"\n\nAccording to Stone, John would often text both women to inform them he was running late to the \"soundstage.\" He'd then asked them to \"warm up the orchestra\" for him. (Now you see where the \"orchestra\" part of the name comes from!)\n\nWeird, right? But no harm done.\n\nAn issue arose, however, when Lawrence and Stone -- who had never met in person, nor talked on the phone -- decided to finally hang out IRL. As Lawrence drove to Stone's house, a fear emerged. What if this wasn't Emma after all, but a trap from John the Orchestra Guy? What if this was a John the Orchestra Guy setup?\n\nWaiting at home, Stone had the same fear.\n\nSpoiler: neither of them was John the Orchestra Guy. They had a nice hangout and are still friends. Once they even went to dinner with Adele!\n\nSo, John the Orchestra Guy, thanks (we think) for bringing two great friends a little closer. Hope the orchestra ended up being ready for you after all.\n\nFeatured Video For You Jennifer Lawrence, Reese Witherspoon speak out about sexual harassment in Hollywood", "images": ["https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05VsvhNCKzsPHRu1LQUAg9S/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1700513622.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/029BsWu9bc6yMfpaB08rXXj/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1701068414.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07y8kh05tsq39fhQl95kxQ4/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1701086481.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06DYXw7p6x5FDsR9q8KOtQ2/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1701189894.png", "https://c.evidon.com/pub/icong1.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05aL2ATpKPEWmyzEqrhomec/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623368305.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05qhvbu7P0Bt7G0HKGb2Hlb/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1701069746.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05Y6BhseklYLY1kS86rVWuZ/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1701270075.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00QKLQ813D5VK1b7zEunHY3/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1701193438.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02o4RbztINibnW4Y3dkWkl0/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1700678213.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06DYXw7p6x5FDsR9q8KOtQ2/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1701189894.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/07y8kh05tsq39fhQl95kxQ4/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1701086481.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05VsvhNCKzsPHRu1LQUAg9S/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1700513622.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/authors/02JzDPHLFbShyPq9FzAGN4d/image.fill.size_100x100.v1624380978.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04PKzradNI3k9jVrRjZBKI8/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1701016430.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/029BsWu9bc6yMfpaB08rXXj/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1701068414.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01bYogHJcR9JmDdqkqRSHPJ/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1700513261.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05qhvbu7P0Bt7G0HKGb2Hlb/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1701069746.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/01bYogHJcR9JmDdqkqRSHPJ/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1700513261.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/04PKzradNI3k9jVrRjZBKI8/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1701016430.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05Y6BhseklYLY1kS86rVWuZ/hero-image.fill.size_220x220.v1701270075.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02o4RbztINibnW4Y3dkWkl0/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1700678213.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00QKLQ813D5VK1b7zEunHY3/hero-image.fill.size_220x133.v1701193438.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05aL2ATpKPEWmyzEqrhomec/hero-image.fill.size_1248x702.v1623368305.jpg", "https://mashable.com/images/group-black-logo-purple.png"], "top_img": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05aL2ATpKPEWmyzEqrhomec/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623368305.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://mashable.com/article/jennifer-lawrence-emma-stone-john-the-orchestra-guy", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone's 'love story' involves a slightly creepy third party", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#00aeef", "application-name": "Mashable.com", "description": "Meet John the Orchestra Guy.", "fb": {"app_id": 122071082108, "pages": 18807449704}, "og": {"site_name": "Mashable", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone's 'love story' involves a slightly creepy third party", "url": "https://mashable.com/article/jennifer-lawrence-emma-stone-john-the-orchestra-guy", "description": "Meet John the Orchestra Guy.", "image": {"identifier": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05aL2ATpKPEWmyzEqrhomec/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623368305.jpg", "secure_url": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05aL2ATpKPEWmyzEqrhomec/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623368305.jpg", "height": 675, "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "article": {"tag": "Celebrities"}}, "article": {"author": "Chloe Bryan", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T15:36:15+00:00", "published_time": "2018-01-04T22:02:24+00:00", "section": "Life"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mashable", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mashable", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone's 'love story' involves a slightly creepy third party", "description": "Meet John the Orchestra Guy.", "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05aL2ATpKPEWmyzEqrhomec/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1623368305.jpg"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515016800.0, "source": "https://mashable.com", "summary": ""}
