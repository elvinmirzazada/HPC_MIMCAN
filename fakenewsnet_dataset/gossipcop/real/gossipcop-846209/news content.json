I need one more banana pic.twitter.com/DBqKjQpSM7 \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017\n\nShe tweeted a guy called Jake who she had been in touch with earlier that day. Jake had two bananas he was willing to sacrifice to the cause.\n\nmy mom just goes \"if I go he better have 2 bananas I not going in traffic for 1\" she's like a real dealer \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017\n\nJake looked only delighted to be receiving a pair of John Legend\u2019s underwear, too.\n\none of the cutest things I've ever seen @onairjake

September 22, 2017\n\nThankfully, Chrissy then had enough bananas to continue with her banana bread.\n\nShe expressed her gratitude for the help Twitter had given her.\n\nShe then posted a couple of videos of the finished banana bread.\n\nAnd, to be fair to her, it does look pretty unreal.\n\nFair play, Chrissy.", "images":
