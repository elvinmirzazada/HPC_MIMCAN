What we said. Where we stood,\u201d the Clooneys said in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE. \u201cWe can\u2019t change this administration\u2019s policy but we can help defend the victims of it.\u201d\n\nThey added, \u201cToday, the Clooney Foundation for Justice will donate $100,000 to the Young Center for Immigrant Children\u2019s Rights.\u201d\n\nThe Clooney Foundation has also sponsored the resettlement of Syrian and Yazidi refugees in the U.S.\n\nAlbert L. Ortega/Getty\n\nThe Young Center\u2019s Executive Director, Maria Woltjen, thanked the couple for their support during this \u201cvital\u201d time.\n\n\u201cThis Administration\u2019s policy disregards international law and basic principles of human decency. To treat children in such a cruel manner not only violates their legal rights but also their basic needs,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to advocate on behalf of the thousands of children who are separated and alone, and we are grateful for the generous support of George and Amal Clooney and the Clooney Foundation for Justice \u2014 it could not be more vital at this time.\u201d\n\nJohn Moore/Getty Images\n\nThe Clooneys join a number of other stars who have blasted the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d immigration policy, which prosecutes undocumented immigrants who cross the border between the U.S. and Mexico. Since implementing the policy, more than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents since April, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAfter House Speaker Paul Ryan shared a Father\u2019s Day post on Twitter talking about how his life changed when he became a dad, John Legend shot back, \u201cSeriously, f\u2014 you. Reunite the families at the border and we can talk about father\u2019s day.\u201d\n\nThe tweet came days after Legend and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, announced they were making a $288K donation to the ACLU on President Trump\u2019s birthday to draw attention to the \u201cimmigrant families seeking asylum and refuge in America being ripped apart due to the inhumane policies of the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nKathy Griffin, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Reese Witherspoon, Ellen DeGeneres and more celebrities also spoke out against the current conditions.\n\nHans-Maximo Musielik/AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nIn her first public commentary about President Trump and his administration, former First Lady Laura Bush wrote an opinion piece for the Washington Post that was published on Father\u2019s Day and criticized the immigration policies.\n\n\u201cI live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,\u201d Mrs. Bush wrote.\n\nSAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty\n\nIn another surprising move, current First Lady Melania Trump released a statement about her husband\u2019s controversial immigration policy.\n\n\u201cMrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families,\u201d her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, told PEOPLE.\n\nGrisham added that her boss is calling on Democrats and Republicans to fix the nation\u2019s immigration crisis.\n\n\u201c[She] hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,\u201d Grisham said, adding that Mrs. Trump \u201cbelieves we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.\u201d", "images":
