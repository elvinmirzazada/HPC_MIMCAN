According to E! News, Lawrence said she thought the Bravo personality is fake for being friends with her enemies and jokingly said about Kent: \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Bitch, you\u2019s a c\u2013t!\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter Kent learned about Lawrence\u2019s name-calling, the Vanderpump Rules cast member took to Twitter, where she posted and deleted three tweets in response to the actress, who\u2019s been vocal about her love of reality TV.\n\n\u201cYou had a classic tweet and delete,\u201d Amy Phillips said on Tuesday\u2019s episode of Reality Checked with Amy Phillips on SiriusXM\u2019s Radio Andy channel before the deleted tweets were read aloud: \u201d \u2018Did Jennifer Lawrence really just call me a c\u2014 on Bravo Watch What Happens Live? And talk about my mama? Bitch, you better pray I don\u2019t see you in the streets. You\u2019re one of the highest-paid actresses on the planet. You claim you are pro women and you call another woman a c\u2014? You\u2019re gross.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSteve Granitz/WireImage; Rich Fury/Getty\n\nKent said of her deleted tweets, \u201cI did a three-peat. I did one tweet, delete. Two tweet, delete. Three tweet, my manager called me and said, \u2018Lala B, what are you doing?\u2019 She goes, \u2018You either delete the tweet or you delete my info for the next 24 hours because I\u2019m not trying to deal.\u2019 So I deleted.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the incident, Kent was disappointed in Lawrence.\n\n\u201cYou know what? The thing is, I mean, no one wants to be a called the c-word. Especially by an A-list celebrity on national television. I was such a huge fan of hers and it just, it bummed me out,\u201d said Kent.\n\nThe SUR hostess added: \u201cI thought that she had a little bit more class than that. Let\u2019s leave the trash up to people like me who do reality TV. Don\u2019t try to steal my thunder, girlfriend.\u201d\n\nDuring her appearance on the Bravo talk show, Lawrence\u2019s dream came true when Cohen surprised her with a dinner party \u2014 complete with Real Housewives of New York City stars Luann de Lesseps and Bethenny Frankel at the table.\n\nIt was a wish-fulfillment moment for Lawrence, who had told Oprah Winfrey in December that de Lesseps, Frankel and Keeping Up with the Kardashians star Scott Disick were the three people \u2014 living or dead \u2014 she\u2019d most want to have at a dinner party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not proud of that, but that\u2019s what comes from my heart,\u201d Lawrence said in the chat, published by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWhile Disick couldn\u2019t make Cohen\u2019s get-together, the WWHL team found a cardboard cutout to fill his spot.\n\nAll of this left Lawrence in complete shock. She jumped for joy, screaming \u201cOh my God,\u201d and quickly running over to hug the Real Housewives of New York City.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to cry,\u201d she said, holding back tears.",
