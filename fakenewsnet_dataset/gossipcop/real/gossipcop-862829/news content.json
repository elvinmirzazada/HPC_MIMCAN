The categories are motion pictures, television, recording, radio, live performance, and sports entertainment.

All entries can be found on the Hollywood Walk of Fame website maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce (see the External links section below). As of October 19, 2023, there are 2,764 stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[1]\n\nA [ edit ]\n\nB [ edit ]\n\nC [ edit ]\n\nD [ edit ]\n\nE [ edit ]\n\nF [ edit ]\n\nG [ edit ]\n\nH [ edit ]\n\nI [ edit ]\n\nJ [ edit ]\n\nK [ edit ]\n\nL [ edit ]\n\nM [ edit ]\n\nN [ edit ]\n\nO [ edit ]\n\nP [ edit ]\n\nQ [ edit ]\n\nName Category Address Date Dennis Quaid Motion pictures 7018 Hollywood Boulevard ( 2005-11-16 ) November 16, 2005 Randy Quaid Motion pictures 7000 Hollywood Boulevard ( 2003-10-07 ) October 7, 2003 Queen Recording 6356 Hollywood Boulevard ( 2002-10-18 ) October 18, 2002 Anthony Quinn Motion pictures 6251 Hollywood Boulevard ( 1960-02-08 ) February 8, 1960 Selena Quintanilla Recording 1750 Vine Street ( 2017-11-03 ) November 3, 2017\n\nR [ edit ]\n\nS [ edit ]\n\nT [ edit ]\n\nU [ edit ]\n\nName Category Address Date Carrie Underwood Recording 1750 Vine Street ( 2018-08-09 ) August 9, 2018 USC School of Cinematic Arts Special 900 W 34th Street ( 2009-09-10 ) September 10, 2009 Robert Urich Television 7083 Hollywood Boulevard ( 1995-12-12 ) December 12, 1995 Usher Recording 6201 Hollywood Boulevard ( 2016-09-07 ) September 7, 2016\n\nV [ edit ]\n\nW [ edit ]\n\nX [ edit ]\n\nNo Entries\n\nY [ edit ]\n\nZ [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ [2] The star for film and television actor Edward Arnold indicates \"Recording\", not \"Motion pictures\", same as the star for country music singer Eddy Arnold ^ The text on Bradley's star includes his term as mayor: \"Mayor Tom Bradley 1973\u20141993\" ^ [3] Merian Cooper's star is misspelled as \"Meriam\". ^ [6] Lotte Lehmann star misspelled as \"Lottie\". ^ [7] Mary Livingstone's star is misspelled as \"Livingston\". ^ [8] Auguste Lumi\u00e8re star misspelled as \"August\". ^ [10] Henry O'Neill's star is misspelled as \"O'Neil\". ^ [11] Dorothy Phillips' star is misspelled as \"Philips\". ^ [12] Ernest Schoedsack's star is misspelled as \"Shoedsach\". ^ [13] Tom Tully's star is incorrectly rendered as \"Thomas L Tully\".", "images": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"], "top_img": "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_on_the_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame", "title": "List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.42.0-wmf.5", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=1000", "og": {"title": "List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
