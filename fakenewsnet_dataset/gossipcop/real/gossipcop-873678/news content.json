Jesse eventually moved out at the end of March 2017.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hollywood\u2019s Ugliest Divorces Throughout their time in the spotlight, some A-listers \u2014 including Brad Pitt, Britney Spears, Madonna and Tom Cruise, among others \u2014 have found themselves involved in pretty messy divorces. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard finalized their divorce in 2017, but their relationship drama continued on with a nasty court battle after they\u2019ve both accused each other of verbal and [\u2026]\n\nDrake-Lee claims in the documents that her partner of 13 years has \u201cnot recognized and prioritized the children\u2019s schedule over his own and their need to maintain it daily, even on weekends, whether or not a parent is working.\u201d She also claims that her ex does not make the children\u2019s school pick-up and drop-off a priority, and tries to make the nanny drive the kids, although that\u2019s not what she was hired to do.\n\nDrake-Lee alleges that she\u2019s concerned about what the 36-year-old actor defines as business. \u201cHis \u2018work\u2019 has allegedly included, so far, trips to Paris, New York, Florida and within California, and activities including giving a graduation speech, attending an awards show, attending a celebrity soccer game in Miami, or doing something undisclosed,\u201d the documents say.\n\nHowever, in previous court documents Williams has claimed that Drake-Lee has declined his requests to spend more time with the children. \u201cAryn restricts my time with the children and decides when, and for how long I may have them,\u201d Williams claimed in the June documents obtained by Us. \u201cShe has rejected, without any reason, each and every request I have made to have the children sleepover at my residence. On the few days that I have the children, Aryn has insisted that my time with the children be limited during the week to approximately two-and-a-half hours per day, despite my requests for more time, including overnights with the children.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars \u2014 They\u2019re Just Like Us! They may live in the spotlight, but these stars have no problem doing every day tasks\n\nDrake-Lee also cites a July 18 incident in which Williams flipped off another driver in the latest documents. \u201cThe other driver aggressively pursued him in his car, bringing his car so close that he was afraid the other driver would hit him and cause an accident,\u201d the documents allege. \u201cI was so alarmed that Jesse exposed our children to danger, unpredictability of the situation and aggression with two vehicles, knowing that this person lives directly next door and we have to encounter him regularly. Jesse knows this neighbor and his state-of-mind.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for Drake-Lee\u2019s request is that she doesn\u2019t want Williams introducing the kids to his sexual partners. \u201cAnother factor in their stability is to prevent the children from seeing a revolving door of intimate partners,\u201d the documents claim. \u201cJesse has shared his time with the children with intimate partner(s).\u201d\n\nAs Us Weekly exclusively revealed in July, the Cabin the Woods actor has been dating Minka Kelly for several months. \u201cThey\u2019re legit,\u201d a source told Us.\n\nThe Band Aid star recently addressed his split and shut down cheating rumors in Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cFootnotes\u201d video for his \u201c4:44\u201d track. \u201cI was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not five years, not seven years, 13 years,\u201d Williams said in the video, \u201cand all of a sudden motherf\u2013kers are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship \u2014 like the most painful experience I\u2019ve had in my life, like with a person I\u2019ve loved with all of my heart \u2014 that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute.\u201d\n\nThank You!

Jesse has been working tirelessly to\n\nmaintain his bond with their children and it is important to note that\n\nthe dramatizations made in Aryn\u2019s declaration are a one-sided account\n\nmade with a specific goal in mind.
