The 37-year-old actrss\u2019s locks are coveted by legions of beauty lovers, who are dying to know the secrets behind her perpetually shiny tresses. Well, thanks to the \u201cX-Men\u201d star\u2019s colorist, Cassondra Kaeding, we might be a little closer to achieving Olivia Munn-level hair.\n\nIn an interview with E! News, Kaeding\u2014who has also worked with celebrity clients like Rosie Huntington-Whitely, Lea Michele, and Kate Hudson\u2014revealed that her best-kept secret for healthy, shiny locks isn\u2019t a fancy-pants hair mask\u2014it\u2019s a $6 conditioner that can be found in most drugstores. The colorist touts Dove\u2019s coconut oil-packed Color Care Conditioner, which she uses as a D.I.Y. hair mask on Munn and other celebrities, for its dual purpose of hydrating hair and extending the life of color-treated locks.\n\n\u201cThe [Dove Color Care Conditioner] has coconut oil, so you can use it as a hair mask,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has dual purposes.\u201d\n\nWhy not use a regular hair mask? Kaeding actually warns against them. She claims that the excess use of hair masks can reduce the product\u2019s effectiveness and result in limp locks. She compares the hair to skin in the sense that it can only absorb so much product until it\u2019s overkill. That\u2019s why she recommends a conditioner as a D.I.Y. mask that\u2019s easy on the hair, but can still provide red-carpet results.\n\n\u201cLess is more. Don\u2019t overdo with too much protein,\u201d she said. \u201cToo much of a good thing can be a bad thing.\u201d\n\nThere you have it. The secret to Munn\u2019s sleek and shiny locks. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse us, we\u2019ll be heading to the drugstore ASAP.", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetabercrombiejeans.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Found-Sir-Mark-Paul-Gosselaar-.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/root-cover-up-fi.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1-Square.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/my-deezer-2023-bgr.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/olivia-munn1.jpg", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/olivia-munn1.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kleemorganicseyecream.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lush-advent-cal.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ytp-eye-cream-fi.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/avene-black-friday.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/friends-thanksgiving-episodes-e1574461204899.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetsweaterset.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/john-mulaney-dating.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/daisy-jones-and-the-six.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RemiBader_Homepage.webp?w=244", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nativaspa-cyber-monday.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://spy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sdfgve.png?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/John-Mulaney-Olivia-Munn.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ulta-hair-sale.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uggdupestarget.gif?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1801114573.jpeg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/olivercabellsneakersale.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Challenge-39.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bestprodsforthinninghair.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/olivia-munn1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Pham"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/beauty/hair-nails/709256/olivia-munn-drugtore-conditioner-diy-hair-mask/", "title": "Olivia Munn Uses This $6 Drugstore Conditioner as a D.I.Y.
