Speculation has grown whether former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, will make the cut since both have enjoyed a warm friendship with Prince Harry over the years.\n\nThe invites were printed at the London press workshop of Barnard and Westwood. Victoria Jones / AP\n\nHowever, the palace did reveal plenty of details about the invitations, which were die-stamped in gold and then burnished and gilded around the edges.\n\nKensington Palace has previously announced that the wedding ceremony will begin at noon local time (7 a.m. EDT/ 4 a.m. PDT). It also said Harry and Markle will open up the Windsor Castle grounds to some local school children, charity workers and select individuals chosen by local leaders throughout the United Kingdom. Once the couple has tied the knot, the pair plan to ride in a carriage procession through the streets of Windsor.\n\nEarlier this week, the palace also revealed details about the wedding cake chosen by Harry and Markle \u2014 a lemon elderflower cake covered in buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers. The cake will come from the London-based Violet Bakery, which is run by pastry chef and California native, Claire Ptak.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20190430091738im_/https://c.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190430091738im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_06/1315948/harry-meghan-today-180205-tease-02_6c9126a871219a2054ab4441c42cff19.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190430091738im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_06/1315948/harry-meghan-today-180205-tease-02_6c9126a871219a2054ab4441c42cff19.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190430091738/https://www.today.com/style/meghan-markle-prince-harry-s-wedding-invitation-revealed-t125645", "title": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding invitation is revealed", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190430091738/https://www.today.com/style/meghan-markle-prince-harry-s-wedding-invitation-revealed-t125645", "title": "Check the mail!
