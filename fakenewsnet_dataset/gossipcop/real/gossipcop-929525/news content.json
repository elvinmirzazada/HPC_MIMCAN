Since I had our first four babies so close to one another, none of them actually remember me being pregnant,\u201d revealed the mother-to-be, who also said \u201cpregnancy has been so fun\u201d because she loves to \u201ctake naps and eat\u201d this time around.\n\n\u201cThey love my growing belly (and boy is it growing), and they cannot wait to meet him. I truly believe this baby is a gift from God for our family in this season,\u201d she said of her sons Duke, 9, and Drake, 12, plus daughters Ella, 11, and Emmie Kay.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

With our little ones getting bigger, we had this gut feeling that it was time to step back and focus on them and our businesses here in Waco, Texas,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cAnd although that\u2019s why we thought we decided to step away from the show, we now realize with this little one on the way that there was a bigger plan in place for us all along,\u201d the Magnolia Table cookbook author concluded.\n\nChip Gaines/Instagram\n\nRELATED VIDEO: It\u2019ll Be a Boy for Chip and Joanna Gaines\n\n\n\nThe couple have shared their excitement over their baby, but have yet to reveal his name, though Chip previously hinted that he may be choosing a moniker that starts with the letter D in keeping with their two older sons\u2019 names.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a D-name. Can you help me think of a D-name?\u201d the soon-to-be father of five, 43, asked in a video posted to Twitter in March.\n\nIn a poll posted by PEOPLE, users voted among four name options for the couple\u2019s impending fifth child: Dane, Donovan, Deacon and Dragon. Some voters even threw in their own suggestions like Dallas, Deagan, David, Duncan, Dusty and Dean, but the poll\u2019s landslide winner was Deacon, which took home 47 percent of the tallies.",
