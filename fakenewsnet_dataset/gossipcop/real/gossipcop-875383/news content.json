I\u2019m so happy for him,\u201d Maltby exclusively told Us Weekly on Monday, December 4. \u201cI\u2019ve met Sarah. Sarah is amazing.\u201d\n\nThe Bachelor alum also revealed what makes Adams and Hyland, 27, such a dynamic duo. \u201cThey bounce off of each other so well, like they really bring out the best of each other,\u201d she shared. \u201cLike they\u2019re both so funny and amp each other up so much. And the smile that Wells gets on his face is unreal. It\u2019s so cute. It really is so cute.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the Nashville-based nurse and the Your Favorite Thing podcast host sent Bachelor Nation fans into a frenzy when they shared a passionate kiss on Bachelor in Paradise this summer right before Maltby left the show.

We are just friends now. If things progress romantically, we\u2019re going to take our time with that and not worry about the show or anything like that trying to make us something that we\u2019re not ready to be. I knew I always wanted to make out with her because she\u2019s gorgeous and awesome and one of my friends. But she\u2019s not part of my friend group, she\u2019s part of my inner circle of friends. So in Nashville I think that was just too weird.\u201d\n\nRelated: 10 Times \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Made Our Heads Explode!
