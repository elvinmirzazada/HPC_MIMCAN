We continue to believe in the value and importance of our work and look forward to resuming our efforts when these allegations are resolved.\u201d\n\nNxivm, which has not responded to numerous requests for comment from PEOPLE on the allegations against Mack and Rainere, has been described by at least one former member as a \u201ccult.\u201d\n\nMack was charged with sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. The actress, best known for her years-long role as Chloe Sullivan on The WB\u2019s Smallville, is facing a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted on all of her charges.\n\nRaniere faces the same charges and potential prison sentence. Both he and Mack have pleaded not guilty.\n\nFederal investigators have accused Mack of recruiting women into a sub-group of NXIVM purported to be a female mentorship group to address their weaknesses but was actually a group created by Raniere that allegedly took advantage of women sexually.\n\n\u201cThe victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants\u2019 benefit,\u201d Richard P. Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, alleged in a statement issued at the time of Mack\u2019s arrest.\n\nMatt Baron/BEI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nNxivm is based out of Albany, New York, and has been the subject of scrutiny from both law enforcement and journalists as it came under fire from Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg, whose estranged daughter, India, joined the group in 2011.\n\nOxenberg first opened up to PEOPLE last year about how she believed India had been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d by Nxivm.\n\n\u2022 Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

PEOPLE\u2018s first-ever podcast, Cover-Up, dives into the Chappaquiddick scandal and attempts to piece together what happened in the hours after Ted Kennedy\u2019s car went over a narrow wooden bridge, killing his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne. Subscribe now on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Play or wherever podcasts are available.\n\nThe complaint against Raniere additionally alleges the women were branded with Raniere\u2019s initials, as he \u201calone forms the top of the pyramid as the highest master.\u201d\n\nA cauterizing pen was used to make the permanent marks near each person\u2019s pubic region, the complaint alleges.\n\nIn statements previously posted to Nxivm\u2019s website, Raniere said all involved in DOS were consenting adults and that Nxivm was not involved in what he called a \u201csorority.\u201d\n\nIn the fall, the group denounced a New York Times article about them as \u201ca criminal product of criminal minds.\u201d\n\nMack and Raniere are scheduled to stand trial on Oct. 1.", "images":
