During his first engagement to Tristan Prettyman in 2011 (they later broke it off six months later), the then-couple vowed to not tie the knot until gay marriage became legal. He was also the first-ever straight man on the cover of Instinct magazine in 2012, recognized for his efforts in support of LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe singer eventually went on to marry his girlfriend, Christina Carano, in October 2015, once same-sex marriage became legal in the U.S.\n\nOn Thursday, the Waitress actor also released his new single, \"Unlonely,\" which will be featured on his upcoming album, Know, set to be released on Aug.10.\n\nFor more on Mraz, watch below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-06%2Fjason_mraz_gettyimages-925216464.jpg%3Fh%3D47679e19&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2F1280_jasonmraz_waitress_gettyimages.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2015-10%2FET_MRAZ_MARRIED_1026_lands.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-06/heidi-klum-gettyimages-983132028.jpg?h=c6980913&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-09%2F1280_grace_vanderwaal_getty-598025090_083016.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/jason_mraz_gettyimages-925216464.jpg?h=47679e19"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/jason_mraz_gettyimages-925216464.jpg?h=47679e19", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jason-mraz-pens-touching-i-am-bi-your-side-love-poem-to-lgbtq-fans-104238", "title": "Jason Mraz Pens Touching 'I Am Bi Your Side' Love Poem to LGBTQ Fans", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/jason_mraz_gettyimages-925216464.jpg?h=47679e19", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 'Love Someone' crooner has always been vocal about his support of LGBTQ rights.", "title": "Jason Mraz Pens Touching 'I Am Bi Your Side' Love Poem to LGBTQ Fans", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jason-mraz-pens-touching-i-am-bi-your-side-love-poem-to-lgbtq-fans-104238", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 'Love Someone' crooner has always been vocal about his support of LGBTQ rights.", "twitter": {"description": "The 'Love Someone' crooner has always been vocal about his support of LGBTQ rights.", "title": "Jason Mraz Pens Touching 'I Am Bi Your Side' Love Poem to LGBTQ Fans", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jason-mraz-pens-touching-i-am-bi-your-side-love-poem-to-lgbtq-fans-104238", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/jason_mraz_gettyimages-925216464.jpg?h=47679e19", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Jason Mraz Pens Touching 'I Am Bi Your Side' Love Poem to LGBTQ Fans | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Music, News, Jason Mraz", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
