And no one is laughing harder that D\u2019Agostino herself.\n\n\u201cIt was too funny,\u201d D\u2019Agostino told PEOPLE at ACE\u2019s Third Annual Foodie Ball \u2014 a charity event to raise money to help the homeless find full-time housing, employment, and economic independence.\n\nThough D\u2019Agostino is known for being able to hold her alcohol, the tequila ended up getting the best of her in Mexico \u2014 and into the shrub she went. \u201cI don\u2019t drink tequila,\u201d she said. \u201cUnderstand we\u2019d been traveling all day, and you know when it just hits you? And I hadn\u2019t eaten, and before I knew it I was in the bush!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was laughing my ass off,\u201d D\u2019Agostino added. \u201cLike they say, if you fall make it part of the dance. I\u2019m in the bush and I\u2019m dying of laughter at myself because it\u2019s too funny.\u201d\n\nThat was just the first fall. The second fall happened when D\u2019Agostino went to walk down a step, not realizing it was a ledge. \u201cOh s\u2014\u201d she screamed as she rolled around the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s bad!\u201d\n\nLuckily, D\u2019Agostino was okay. In fact, she didn\u2019t have a single injury on her!\n\n\u201cCan you believe I don\u2019t have one scratch from both of my tumbles? Not one,\u201d she told PEOPLE. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018How did you come out unscathed?\u2019 Like they say when you drink, I was very flexible. So the tequila broke my falls!\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Andy Cohen\u2019s Pick For The Most Absurd Real Housewives\u2019 Business Ever\n\nSo how does D\u2019Agostino respond to those who might point to that scene as evidence of a bigger drinking problem?\n\n\u201cIn the 10 years I\u2019ve been doing the show, have you ever seen me out of line?\u201d D\u2019Agostino asked. \u201cNo. It just hit me. Bam!\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images":
