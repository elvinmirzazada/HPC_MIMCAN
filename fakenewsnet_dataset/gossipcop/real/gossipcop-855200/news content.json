I\u2019m not even sure how you can assess the size of its meaning, only really your heart truly knows and it\u2019s too special for words,\u201d Gaga wrote on Sunday, sharing a series of photos of Durham, her friend of more than a decade. \u201cI feel two competing feelings. Firstly, that I will live everyday with more passion, more determination, more compassion and more giving than ever before. Because that\u2019s who she was, and it\u2019s what drew us to each other, and I know it\u2019s what she always wanted for me.\u201d\n\nMother Monster also reflected on her friend\u2019s ability to keep her centered and inspired.\n\n\u201cShe had this incredible way of releasing me from the anchor of my own sadness that held me back, she loved me fearlessly while I learned how to cope with fame and stay inspired no matter how scared I was. She knew all I cared about was the music. She made that ok. The other feeling I have is that of being robbed of the last 10 years of my life, friendship and career with her. Like someone took her from us, and with that taking took all the good times. I know that\u2019s not true, and I know that I have those memories forever, I\u2019m just in shock that I will never have new ones with her. I\u2019m in shock that I won\u2019t see her again until I pass too,\u201d Gaga, 31, wrote of Durham, who managed the behind-the-scenes of Gaga\u2019s famous Super Bowl performance in February.\n\nThe songstress vowed to be a voice for cancer patients.\n\n\u201cI vow to be a little stronger everyday for her because that\u2019s what she would have wanted, I vow to be stronger for anyone who\u2019s lost somebody to cancer. I\u2019m a part of that family now. I vow to be a warrior for her and be a voice for cancer patients so the world can continue to improve the dialogue and the fight. I loved her. I still love her. And I love so much her husband Andre, stepson Sante, and friends. I made them some food yesterday. I will keep cooking. Cooking my soul until it understands this,\u201d she said.\n\nGaga concluded, \u201cLast thing I told her, \u2018Go find Joanne, Sonj.\u2019 Somehow I think she did. @sonjad7777 #sonjadurham #grigiogirls.\u201d\n\nHer final hashtag referenced her homage to Durham in \u201cGrigio Girls,\u201d off the Joanne deluxe edition album. The opening lyric sheds light on Gaga\u2019s lost years pre-fame, during which a \u201cTexas girl real strong\u201d showed her the strength to be found.\n\n\u201cI was 23, she was 35 / I was spiralin\u2019 out and she was so alive,\u201d the lyrics read.\n\nGaga had posted about Durham\u2019s cancer battle last week.\n\n\u201cWatching one of my best friends in the world show unfathomable courage, strength, and positivity while battling cancer has really changed my life. Thank you Sonja for inspiring me and all of us everyday with your joy,\u201d Gaga, 31, wrote on Instagram Thursday, along with a black and white photo of Durham and her husband, Andre Dubois. In March, Gaga attended and helped plan Durham\u2019s wedding to Dubois, for which Durham called Gaga her \u201cguardian angel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you so much it brings tears to my eyes just to think of all the years we\u2019ve spent together backstage running the show, taking care of each other. You are one of a kind. I\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d the songstress continued in her post. \u201cAnd you and Andre, your unbreakable beautiful love is what life is all about. You can see it in this photo. Wanted to share this with the world and show them what true beauty looks like. I love you girl. I love you so much.\u201d\n\nDuring weekend two of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Gaga dedicated an acoustic version of her song \u201cEdge of Glory\u201d to Durham during a beautiful and somber moment of her headlining act.\n\n\u201cMy friend Sonja is very sick and I love her so much and if it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019d like to sing this song for her,\u201d she said in April. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t feel well. We all wish you were here with us.\u201d\n\nFollowing Sonja\u2019s death, the hashtag #RIPSonja trended on Twitter, with many of Gaga\u2019s followers sending support to the singer and paying tribute to her friendship with Durham.", "images":
