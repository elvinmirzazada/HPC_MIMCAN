So, fans were confused when they saw photos of Skarsgard on the show\u2019s season two set.\n\n\"I was on set, yes. I can\u2019t disclose what I did on set,\u201d Skarsgard coyly shared on Wednesday\u2019s Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. \"Maybe, I was acting. I might have been just moral support. I might have just made coffee for the ladies. I might have helped Meryl Streep with her acting\u2026 Not help, but just give her little pointers, fine tune it a bit.\u201d\n\nIn the upcoming season, Streep is portraying Mary Louise Wright, the headstrong mother of Perry. If Skarsgard does end up reprising his role in the series, even in flashbacks, it will be his first real chance to work with Streep, despite them having both starred in the 2014 film The Giver.\n\n\"I did a movie years ago and one of the incentives was to work with Meryl Streep. It was a scene with Meryl Streep and I was very, very excited about it,\u201d he recalled. \"I didn\u2019t sleep the night before. I was really excited about it. I showed up on set and I was like, \u2018Alright, where is Mrs. Streep?\u2019\u201d\n\nTurns out, she was no where near the set in South Africa.\n\n\"And they were like, \u2018Oh no, she\u2019s in London. She\u2019s going to be hologram in this scene because it\u2019s a sci-fi. So you\u2019re just going to stare into empty space here and say your lines and someone will read Meryl\u2019s lines off camera,\u2019\u201d Skarsgard recalled, laughing.\n\nSkarsgard won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his role as Perry in Big Little Lies, as did his on-screen wife, Nicole Kidman.\n\nLast summer, the 42-year-old actor pitched some ideas to ET as to how his character could return to the show.\n\n\"Well, we can do a prequel,\" he suggested. \"I tried to pitch the idea of Perry having a twin sister who shows up, Terry, and she's, like, pissed off because all these ladies killed her brother. So, basically a revenge story of her just going berserk in Monterey and killing all these women.\"\n\nFor more on the second season of Big Little Lies, watch the clip below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-09%2Fwitherspoon3.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2023-11/GettyImages-953223800.jpg?h=d4a2cb2c&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-08%2Fgettyimages-634203822.jpg%3Fh%3Dcb64a112&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/alexander-skarsgard-tonight-show.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-09%2Falexander-skarsgard-tonight-show.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-12%2Fbll.jpg%3Fh%3Dd1cb525d&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/alexander-skarsgard-tonight-show.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/alexander-skarsgard-hints-that-hes-returning-for-big-little-lies-season-2-110502", "title": "Alexander Skarsgard Hints That He's Returning for \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 Season 2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/alexander-skarsgard-tonight-show.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The actor's character was killed off in the first season of the hit HBO drama.", "title": "Alexander Skarsgard Hints That He's Returning to \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/alexander-skarsgard-hints-that-hes-returning-for-big-little-lies-season-2-110502", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The actor's character was killed off in the first season of the hit HBO drama.", "twitter": {"description": "The actor's character was killed off in the first season of the hit HBO drama.", "title": "Alexander Skarsgard Hints That He's Returning to \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/alexander-skarsgard-hints-that-hes-returning-for-big-little-lies-season-2-110502", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/alexander-skarsgard-tonight-show.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Alexander Skarsgard Hints That He's Returning for \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 Season 2 | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Alexander Skarsgard, Meryl Streep, Big Little Lies", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
