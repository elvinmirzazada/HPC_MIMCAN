The song had a foot in the worlds of both albums, but it bore the mark of the turn-of-the-millennium pop trends that had taken hold in the intervening years. In fact, the only thing that could be classified as country was Twain\u2019s singing on \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Getcha Good!\u201d which in turn bore its own resemblance, both in message and in its sultry delivery, to that of Debbie Harry on Blondie\u2019s classic \u201cOne Way or Another.\u201d Switching between those different meters was the key to Twain\u2019s success, and while Up! didn\u2019t quite hit the dizzying heights of Come On Over, \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Getcha Good!\u201d became yet another hit, later getting covered by the Jonas Brothers.
