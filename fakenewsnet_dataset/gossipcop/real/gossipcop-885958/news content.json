During last week\u2019s episode of the MTV reality series, the 26-year-old North Carolina native threatened to quit the show because her husband, David Eason, had been fired.\n\nJenelle has stayed mostly quiet on social media about her recent drama, but over the weekend, she clarified that she will be back on Teen Mom 2, whether she wants to be or not.\n\n\u201cHave lots of offers from many different people, but you have to turn them down when you\u2019re locked in a contract. #Annoying,\u201d she tweeted on Sunday.\n\nShe told one fan that she was \u201cjust clarifying rumors\u201d and added to another that she\u2019s \u201cstill butting heads\u201d with the show.\n\nOn Monday, she retweeted the news that she is skipping the main reunion taping and instead filming her own segment separately. Jenelle was very vocal about her frustrations with this season of the show after David was fired for his insensitive tweets about the LGBT community earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI will go do my own thing and I will get out of my contract,\u201d she told producers during last week\u2019s episode. \u201cBest believe, mark my f**king words. I\u2019m not doing it. I\u2019ll go do my own thing. I have people offering me stuff for Netflix and Amazon right f**king now.\u201d\n\nJenelle has faced her fair share of controversy this season. In a recent episode, she was involved in a road rage incident in which she allegedly pulled a gun on a man after following him to his house. Jenelle denied the claims, though her 9-year-old son, Jace, who was in the car at the time, told her mother and his legal guardian, Barbara, that Jenelle did pull out the gun.\n\nFollowing the incident, Barabara was seen talking to Nathan Griffith, Jenelle\u2019s ex and the father of her son, Kaiser, about trying to get custody of all of her daughter's children.\n\nHere's more on the drama:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/jenelle-evans-gettyimages-858348882.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-08%2Fjenelle-evans-gettyimages-858348882.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/jenelle-evans-gettyimages-858348882.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jenelle-evans-says-shes-locked-in-to-her-teen-mom-2-contract-after-threatening-to-leave-show-107456", "title": "Jenelle Evans Says She\u2019s \u2018Locked In' to Her 'Teen Mom 2' Contract After Threatening to Leave Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/jenelle-evans-gettyimages-858348882.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The reality star told producers that she planned to get out of her contract in last week\u2019s episode.", "title": "Jenelle Evans Isn't Leaving 'Teen Mom 2'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jenelle-evans-says-shes-locked-in-to-her-teen-mom-2-contract-after-threatening-to-leave-show-107456", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The reality star told producers that she planned to get out of her contract in last week\u2019s episode.", "twitter": {"description": "The reality star told producers that she planned to get out of her contract in last week\u2019s episode.", "title": "Jenelle Evans Isn't Leaving 'Teen Mom 2'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jenelle-evans-says-shes-locked-in-to-her-teen-mom-2-contract-after-threatening-to-leave-show-107456", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/jenelle-evans-gettyimages-858348882.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Jenelle Evans Says She\u2019s \u2018Locked In' to Her 'Teen Mom 2' Contract After Threatening to Leave Show | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Jenelle Evans, Teen Mom 2", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 41, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
