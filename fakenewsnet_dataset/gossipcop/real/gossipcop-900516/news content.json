Harry, 37, also said that the royal family \"literally cut me off financially\" following their Jan. 2020 announcement of stepping back.\n\nCampbell Addy for The Cut\n\nHowever, Prince Charles did see Harry and Meghan \u2014 as well as have a reunion with grandson Archie Harrison, 3, and a first meeting with granddaughter Lilibet Diana, 1 \u2014 when the family visited the U.K. in June for Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee celebration.\n\nFor more on Meghan Markle, listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.\n\n\"It was a fantastic visit.

He hadn't met Lilibet, his granddaughter, and so to meet her for the first time was very emotional \u2014 it was a wonderful thing,\" the source said.\n\nPrince Harry, Prince Charles, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and Meghan Markle. Getty\n\nSpeaking about how they run Archewell together from a shared home office, Prince Harry said, \"Most people that I know and many of my family, they aren't able to work and live together. It's actually really weird because it'd seem like a lot of pressure. But it just feels natural and normal.\"\n\nWhen asked if there was room to heal the rifts with their families, Meghan told The Cut, \"I think forgiveness is really important. It takes a lot more energy to not forgive. But it takes a lot of effort to forgive. I've really made an active effort, especially knowing that I can say anything.\"\n\n\"I have a lot to say until I don't,\" she added. \"Do you like that? Sometimes, as they say, the silent part is still part of the song.\"\n\nMeghan Markle, King Charles and Prince Harry.
