Miles is sharing the role with Naoko Mori in the production of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical, which transferred from New York City\u2019s Lincoln Center Theater and opened in London\u2019s West End in July.\n\n\u201cLast night, our friend @RuthieAnnMiles was a triumph in @KingandIWestEnd,\u201d wrote Miles\u2019 costar Kelli O\u2019Hara. \u201cEvery moment was a gift and continues to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is singing like an angel and commanding the stage with a heavenly force,\u201d O\u2019Hara, 42, added. \u201cAn inspiration to all. I knew you would want to know.\u201d\n\nTheo Wargo/Getty Images\n\nPaul Kolnik\n\nMany at the show and beyond shared their thoughts about Miles\u2019 return on social media.\n\n\u201c@RuthieAnnMiles gave the bravest performance I have ever seen and was just incredible,\u201d wrote one audience member on Twitter.\n\n\u201cTonight was @RuthieAnnMiles first night and it was an absolute masterclass in strength and courage,\u201d tweeted another. \u201cI will be forever in awe of her performance and of her.\u201d\n\nAshley Park, Miles\u2019 former costar and the Tony-nominated Mean Girls star, also honored Miles on Instagram.\n\n\u201cSending all my love to @ruthieannmiles who performed for the first time in London tonight,\u201d she wrote. \u201cUnspeakable bravery, rawness, and brilliance. What I would have given to be there. With angel cards, pranks, and apple cider vinegar for you unee. Thrilled she is surrounded by Bart, Kelli, Ken, and KING AND I family.\u201d\n\nIn March, Miles \u2014 who was seven months pregnant at the time \u2014 was injured and her 4-year-old daughter, Abigail Blumenstein, was killed when a driver struck them in Brooklyn, New York. The driver also struck and killed 1-year-old Joshua Lew and injured his mother, Miles\u2019 friend Lauren.\n\nOn May 17, Miles\u2019 family lawyer, Ben Rubinowitz, announced on Instagram on her behalf that the child she and her husband Jonathan Blumenstein were expecting did not make it.\n\n\u201cAt the time of the crash, Ruthie was pregnant and was severely injured,\u201d Rubinowitz said.\n\nHe went on to explain that the couple had chosen a name, Sophia Rosemary Wong Blumenstein, for their unborn daughter, adding, \u201cThe pain suffered by Ruthie and Jonathan is nearly impossible to fathom.\u201d\n\nRuthie Ann Miles and Abigail Blumenstein. Walter McBride/WireImage\n\nA source previously told PEOPLE that prior to Abigail\u2019s death, the 4 year old \u201cwas excited to be a big sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was the brightest little spirit,\u201d said the source. \u201cEvery time you were around her, your heart couldn\u2019t help but shine. She had the sweetest laugh and the loveliest personality. She was very much like her mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cRuthie was a wonderful mother,\u201d continued the source. \u201cShe always put Abigail first and was really dedicated to spending time together. The two had a very tight bond. They were inseparable.\u201d\n\nAnother source previously told PEOPLE that Miles and her husband Jonathan \u201cwere excited about expanding their family.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Pregnant Actress Ruthie Ann Miles Out of ICU and \u2018Healing\u2019 After Death of 4-Year-Old Daughter\n\nIn May, a Brooklyn grand jury indicted Dorothy Bruns, the 44-year-old Staten Island driver involved in the fatal crash.\n\nAt the time, a prosecution source told PEOPLE that Bruns was arraigned on charges of manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and assault stemming from the March 5 crash that killed Abigail and Joshua.\n\nBruns\u2019 lawyer entered a not guilty plea on her behalf.\n\nPreviously, NYPD sources told PEOPLE that Bruns claimed she experienced a seizure at the time of the crash. The sources allege that after running the red light, Bruns then continued down the street until crashing into some parked cars.
