The three were seen eating dinner on the rooftop of the Hunger Games star\u2019s building.\n\nTheroux, 46, and Stone, 29, have been spending time together since his split from Jennifer Aniston in February. Two weeks ago, the actor was seen lounging shirtless in the sun next to Stone, who wore a red one-piece bathing suit, in a bungalow at the famed Hotel du Cap Eden Roc in France.\n\nShutterstock (2)\n\nBoth had been in the country for the Louis Vuitton Cruise 2019 show, as they\u2019re ambassadors of the luxury brand.\n\nTwo days later, the duo took their adventures to the water for a day of fun in the sun with some celebrity pals, according to photos obtained by the Daily Mail.\n\nSienna Miller, TV host Derek Blasberg and Spider Man: Homecoming actress Laura Harrier joined them for a dip in the Mediterranean. Stone sported a frilly white bikini before covering up in a yellow dress, while Miller, 36, opted for a blue and white patterned two-piece.\n\nStone and Theroux became friends after working together on the upcoming Netflix show Maniac. Before their trip to France, they were seen together following the Met Gala leaving an afterparty at Up & Down Club. While the two left the club separately, they got into a car together with Shailene Woodley before driving off.\n\nDays before the Met Gala, they were photographed grabbing dinner together in New York City at Blue Ribbon Sushi in Soho. The friendly pair also hung out together in April with Queer Eye\u2018s Jonathan Van Ness. The trio posed for a picture that he posted to his Instagram story. Among the captions Theroux put on the post was a clear message about his relationship status: \u201cBffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs.\u201d\n\nTheroux also has another new special lady in his life. On Sunday, the actor introduced his new pet on Instagram. The post featured a sweet shot of his new dog Kuma, which means bear in Japanese, and went on to thank all the of the people who made the pit bull\u2019s adoption possible.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/wUUKorvGyGL4Z-qm9T_8ymR9ud0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(666x123:668x125)/rebel-wilson-traks-am-052623-4c2ef93fc3414ef3b6ed627a7c9301e8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/OAkovNN-4RXVoQiKI618yOA3WkM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(599x0:601x2)/emma-justin-2-81d352577f7b496181830cce1a41d9f6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/V0_B8RoQ7cypdMEKO1Py0_vxVH8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/bruce-springsteen-steven-van-zandt-053123-1-SQ-73ad241034444680bf21c72a291d6368.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8jzRxThahgNMGDKbx_yRXDWAMS4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1016x454:1018x456)/the-weeknd-dating-history-954a5da8e7e44350954699c8f1bdfd20.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lizPmEHLP4Idux7x2hwWUD4oi0I=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x449:981x451)/jennifer-aniston-bradd-pitt-justin-theroux-a32f0c47037f4c5aa7029f679a36e529.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/nyAfdsr_QlPjR45c4FeGD71dUEM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(731x404:733x406)/emma-stone-taylor-swift-060623-1-ca9d999721ce47dda3e1182c4ea2ddae.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/niidxCDBjGVC22bJfSOKYt8iQYw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x494:921x496)/emma-stone-andrew-garfield-f4eef45c31774b4397c6559827a9ec00.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/_izB5bc2A3GANy5D7SE25ouDAGU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x99:676x101)/justin-theroux-esquire-woody-harrelson-050123-1-2334bb7a805b4ae1a047e4394c367f1e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7uKqnwEIk30_zi-aAVIiRwSFHx8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1329x549:1331x551)/Leslie-Jones-052723-01-85dba03507f14af4b8020920764d3c27.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/u3gx56fvRxoQWzKM_rAUkboO_94=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x554:1001x556)/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-tout-1092eb9a2bd549b5b4f940c6134f3a33.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/vyD0nYwmIx4I9FjXtoTLFeUkcWs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/margot-robbie-121622-d722dc12d4424b7082ccb13a13c1aab8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Ztx5gf33Y2r9gOeYxFmI12AOheQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1099x452:1101x454)/emma-stone-dave-mccary-1-4d6fc34af7214742ae9f8206d7ccb349.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/unNxIm-TT1KWr5-nJpyHduDqBrE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(750x339:752x341)/jennifer-garner-2000-968db7e049e94bd18da3bfce07d0dbad.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rlPws0pqyoIdd7X6L7FXl9ueSoA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(599x0:601x2)/justin-theroux-supports-jennifer-aniston-after-she-speaks-out-about-infertility-struggles-111022-1-796e3c285e0048f6aeb9e19fc5e13e73.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/LSarYvPNfYza-nOjMHG6a3yz6HA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/shawn-mendes-011323-5ad1f126098140879afcf8916543ec2e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NBwsAXK9Wd3vmgG_ci5-1VOdRn4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/lizzo-bottlerock-napa-valley-052923-1-SQ-4ac06a6bc78f4b348171c31a224fcb86.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/IcsuO0wzdE3xmxo6eXtNKD4t3J0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/beyonce-concert-053023-1-SQ-d88965eb0888447fb7a44a353765c701.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/OAkovNN-4RXVoQiKI618yOA3WkM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(599x0:601x2)/emma-justin-2-81d352577f7b496181830cce1a41d9f6.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Miller", "Mike Miller Is A Former Writer", "Reporter At People.
