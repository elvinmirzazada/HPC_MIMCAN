News, the actor was reminded of this event and he could only share how \"amazing\" of an experience it was for him to be involved in such a film.\n\n\"It's all fond memories,\" Pattinson remarked about filming the \"Twilight\" movies. \"I mean it's almost more fond the further away you get from it ... it's just such a magical way to spend your 20s.\"\n\n\"I mean it's completely crazy. I still haven't really processed it. I mean I always thought that there'd be more of a fallout\u2014a psychological fallout years later,\" the actor adds.\n\nHis remarks about the film come just a week after his ex-girlfriend and fellow \"Twilight\" star Kristen Stewart dished about her own experiences filming the franchise. In fact, she was actually surprised that so much time had already gone by since they filmed the last \"Twilight\" film. Stewart had also shared how lucky she was to have been part of such an experience and that she has taken a lot from the franchise going so far as to say that the film series has made her what she is today.\n\nBased on the popular novel series by Stephenie Meyer, the first \"Twilight\" film was released in 2008 and was an instant success spanning five films and grossing over $3 billion all in all.", "images": ["https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/13/18/131819_a_66_66.jpg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/14/90/149010_a_66_66.jpg",
