The veteran actor reunited with his Rocky Balboa costar Milo Ventimiglia while filming scenes for season 2 of This Is Us.\n\nStallone, 71, took to Instagram on Saturday, August 12, to share photos from the set of the NBC drama as he began working on his one-episode role. He will play an actor who helps Kevin Pearson (Justin Hartley) adjust to fame on the set of a period war film directed by Ron Howard.\n\nRelated: 10 Most Devastating TV Deaths of 2016 Viewers lost their heads in 2016 as characters on popular TV shows such as 'Game of Thrones,' 'The Walking Dead' and 'This Is Us' said goodbye \u2014 here are the year's 10 most memorable demises\n\nVentimiglia, 40, revealed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! earlier this month that he called the Rocky actor to see if he\u2019d be willing to appear on This Is Us. Stallone shared a photo with the Emmy nominee on Instagram on Saturday, writing, \u201cMy good buddy Milo Ventimiglia who was nice enough to invite me to be on the show.\u201d\n\nVentimiglia opened up about Stallone\u2019s role in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that the material attracts the greats even like Sly,\u201d he told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cAnd to know that he\u2019d want to be a part and play with us, it\u2019s a very good feeling, so we\u2019re thrilled.\u201d\n\nOn the THIS IS US set with Justin Hartley , this is a fantastic show and he is great to work with!#thisisus @justinhartley A post shared by Sly Stallone (@officialslystallone) on Aug 12, 2017 at 6:57pm PDT\n\nGetting punched out by the amazing@chrissymetz On the set of THIS IS US #thisisus A post shared by Sly Stallone (@officialslystallone) on Aug 12, 2017 at 7:04pm PDT\n\nRelated: 10 Once-Great TV Shows That Went Downhill It's tough to stay on top, as TV shows including 'Glee' and 'True Detective' learned the hard way \u2014 here are 10 shows that lost their way\n\nStallone also shared some behind-the-scenes snaps with other members of the cast. \u201cOn the THIS IS US set with Justin Hartley , this is a fantastic show and he is great to work with!\u201d he captioned a picture with Hartley, 40.\n\nThe three-time Oscar nominee then posted a photo of Chrissy Metz playfully punching him in the face. \u201cGetting punched out by the amazing @chrissymetz on the set of THIS IS US,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIt is unlikely that Stallone and Ventimiglia will share the screen again, though. Ventimiglia\u2019s beloved character, Jack Pearson, died prior to the present-day scenes on This Is Us.\n\nRelated: Huge TV Shows That Were Quickly Canceled and Forgotten From 'Joey' to 'Cavemen,' these infamous TV flops prove just because viewers know about a show, doesn't mean they'll watch it\n\nStill, Stallone will play a \u201cfather figure\u201d to Hartley\u2019s character, creator Dan Fogelman said at the Television Critics Association press tour. \u201cWe needed a big star for this movie, and we\u2019re really excited for the script,\u201d Fogelman said on August 3.\n\nThank You!
