Julianna Margulies confirms to TVLine that she was invited to bring Alicia Florrick over to the CBS All Access spinoff during the series\u2019 inaugural season, but she wasn\u2019t quite ready to go there.\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t want to do it when they asked me in the first season,\u201d she recalls, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t think that was fair [to the series or its cast, led by Christine Baranski, Cush Jumbo and Rose Leslie]. I felt like, \u2018Get on your own two feet. Do your thing.\u2019 Because if Alicia had come in, in the first season, it would have been [all] about Alicia and The Good Wife. And now it\u2019s their show.\u201d\n\nMargulies, however, does not rule out a future cameo on The Good Fight, which was recently renewed for a third season (to bow in early 2019). Despite harboring \u201cuncomfortable\u201d feelings about \u201cgoing backwards\u201d in her career, the three-time Emmy winner \u2014 who\u2019s currently starring in AMC\u2019s new ultra dark dramedy Dietland \u2014 says, \u201cI never say never to anything, because I think that\u2019s silly.\u201d\n\nCase in point: She returned to ER for that show\u2019s final season. \u201cIt was one week and [George Clooney and I] had a blast,\u201d Margulies enthuses. \u201cIt felt so comfortable to get back into that relationship and those clothes and those lines and let these characters \u2014 who were such a part of American culture \u2014 come back. So I would never say never because I loved going back to ER.\u201d\n\nMargulies watched the Good Fight pilot and thought it was \u201cmagnificent.\u201d But she never made it to Episode 2 or beyond. \u201cI said to [franchise creators] Robert and Michelle [King] recently that it\u2019s hard for me to watch a law show right now, which is how I felt after ER,\u201d she admits. \u201cI couldn\u2019t watch another medical show, because you go right back into [the mechanics of shooting a show like that]. It just takes you out of the show. I\u2019ll binge watch it in a year or two.\u201d (With reporting by Kim Roots)", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4e0dc24f4a2640fceabdebef21a9d2e8?s=32&d=blank&r=pg",
