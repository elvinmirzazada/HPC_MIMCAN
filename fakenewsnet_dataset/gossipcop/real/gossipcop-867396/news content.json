The couple recently celebrated Honor's ninth birthday in June, and the proud parents took to Instagram to share sweet messages for their eldest daughter.\n\nAlba posted a heartwarming flashback photo from when Honor was a newborn, and wrote, \"The day you were born, I found my true calling in life. You turned my life and world right side up.\"\n\nWarren penned a touching note for his little girl, explaining, \"Having you has taught me how to appreciate the here and now. I can't afford to wish for tomorrow because I know I'll miss today. You are kind, thoughtful and fair. You are smart, creative and driven. You're not afraid to lead but more importantly you're not afraid to listen. Keep it up my champ! You're doing great. I love you. I'm so proud of you.\"\n\nAlba has even been a parenting mentor for her friend and \"Sin City\" co-star Jaime King when the 38-year-old actress was expecting her first son, James, with husband Kyle Newman.\n\n\"Jess Alba was always on speed dial for me,\" King said of the Honest Company founder, who is also the godmother to James. \"I didn't know what I was doing when I had my first child and I had to go back to work so soon. I was terrified but I always call her\u2026 I think in the lifestyle we have, it's very different and it's not as easy to navigate, and she does it so elegantly and seamlessly and so I'm very lucky.\"\n\nCheck out the video below for more adorableness from Alba's happy family.", "images": ["https://www.cbsnews.com/assets/live_icons/flyout-live-cbs-sports-hq@1x.png",
