According to those reports, in fact, the Queen enjoyed the series though clucked her tongue, predictably at some of the \u201cheavily dramatized\u201d historical liberties. The Crown star Claire Foy didn\u2019t trust the rumors, telling Vanity Fair: \u201cI will believe it when I see it is all I\u2019ll say.\u201d Well perhaps after this year\u2019s Christmas speech in which the Queen appears to have included a cute little nod to Season 2, Foy will believe she has a royal fan.\n\nIn the fifth episode of the most recent season of The Crown, Foy\u2019s version of The Queen gives a disastrous and stiff speech to workers at a car factory. At the time and as depicted in the episode, royal critic Lord Altrincham suggested one solution to the Queen\u2019s communication difficulties was to televise her annual Christmas message\u2014which she has done ever since. In this year\u2019s speech, many suspect, the Queen paid direct homage to that Season 2 plot.\n\nThe Queen opened by saying: \u201cSixty years ago today, a young woman spoke about the speed of technological change as she presented the first television broadcast of its kind. She described the moment as a landmark. Six decades on, the presenter has \u2018evolved\u2019 somewhat, as has the technology she described.\u201d Don\u2019t let the third person fool you, the Queen is talking of herself here, and of a moment Foy embodied beautifully for Netflix.\n\nNow it\u2019s entirely possible that someone else\u2014savvy to the show\u2014slipped that reference in on the Queen\u2019s behalf. But whether authored by Elizabeth herself or someone close to her, the acknowledgment of The Crown was a hit with audiences.\n\nX content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6566170fa07f97a6dc41374c/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a2c40cf8ae8fd2b3a999a9d/1:1/pass/t-Adolf-Hitler-Duke-and-Duchess-of-Windsor.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-12-26%2520at%252012.20.59%2520PM.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a14c7dc99135b2b9a688407/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Queen-Elizabeth-Prince-Philip-70th-SS02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a26ff63cbb3bf3297923353/1:1/pass/Princess-Margaret-Lord-Snowdown-Relationship-SS16.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a2f53ca577ffb294a25322e/1:1/pass/the-crown-season-3.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660f10fa28999da8edabc8/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a14c7dcaba4653ae2347b46/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Queen-Elizabeth-Prince-Philip-70th-SS03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-26%20at%2012.20.59%20PM.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1c4461724b4c6e320e9432/1:1/pass/t-Vanessa-Kirby-1217-Vanities.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a14c7dc821fe67c49623a77/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Queen-Elizabeth-Prince-Philip-70th-SS01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/656510d0affa7b4408631071/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-26%20at%2012.20.59%20PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Joanna Robinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/12/does-queen-elizabeth-watch-the-crown-christmas-speech-season-2", "title": "Did the Real Queen Elizabeth Just Prove She Watches The Crown?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "A sneaky Season 2 reference made its way into her Christmas speech.", "id": "5a42ac2df504972c1f3e6a8e", "keywords": "real queen elizabeth,claire foy,the crown,season,christmas speech", "news_keywords": "real queen elizabeth,claire foy,the crown,season,christmas speech", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a42ac2df504972c1f3e6a8e", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"A sneaky Season 2 reference made its way into her Christmas speech.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-26%20at%2012.20.59%20PM.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-26%20at%2012.20.59%20PM.png\"}", "og": {"description": "A sneaky Season 2 reference made its way into her Christmas speech.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-26%20at%2012.20.59%20PM.png", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Did the Real Queen Elizabeth Just Prove She Watches The Crown?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/12/does-queen-elizabeth-watch-the-crown-christmas-speech-season-2"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-12-26T21:14:16.153Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-26T21:14:16.153Z", "author": "Joanna Robinson"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "A sneaky Season 2 reference made its way into her Christmas speech.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-26%20at%2012.20.59%20PM.png?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Did the Real Queen Elizabeth Just Prove She Watches The Crown?"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a42afa777bfbd53e1f5cc33/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-26%20at%2012.20.59%20PM.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XVWGYmrXjH0?ecver=2"], "publish_date": 1514322856.153, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
