The 54-year-old released a statement about her decision to depart on Wednesday, which comes before the series' current season, its 10th, finishes airing. The cast has completed filming, however, having taped the reunion special earlier this month.\n\n\"After six seasons on Bravo\u2019s [Real Housewives of New York City], I have decided to return to what I do best \u2014 journalism and producing,\u201d Carole writes. \u201cI am sure this does not come as a surprise to any of the viewers, all of whom have been supportive, encouraging, and kind.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s current season has largely focused on Carole\u2019s falling out with one-time bestie Bethenny Frankel. The duo has been locked in a fight over growing pains in their friendship since the season premiere, though it\u2019s never been made totally clear what their fight is about exactly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to leave frenemies behind,\u201d Carole notes in her statement, seemingly a nod to Bethenny. The timing of Carole\u2019s exit announcement is somewhat poetic, as she once joked that the summer of 2018 would be her \u201clast great summer.\u201d\n\nThe former ABC news producer and author, who has penned both a memoir and a novel, joined RHONY in its fifth season after a major cast overhaul, which saw the exits of original stars Jill Zarin and Alex McCord. At the time, Carole wasn\u2019t the typical Housewife, a young widow who came from the world of hard news.\n\n\u201cMy original curiosity about reality television has waned over the years,\" Carole\u2019s statement continues. \u201cI am focusing on TV and writing projects that better suit my more steady temperament. I have worked with amazing producers, made great friends \u2026 I will remember this entire experience with delight, humor, and a veracious accuracy. Next.\u201d\n\nCarole appeared to further address her exit on Instagram, sharing a post that simply said, \"Didn't change, just learned,\" which might be a response to unsupportive viewers.\n\nBravo has not revealed if any other cast changes will be made ahead of RHONY\u2019s 11th season. The current lineup includes Ramona Singer, Luann de Lesseps, Sonja Morgan, Dorinda Medley and Tinsley Mortimer, in addition to Carole and Bethenny.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-07%2Fpic_rhony_bethenny.jpg%3Fh%3D9153bea5&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-07%2Fnup_183067_0217.jpg%3Fh%3Dc7ba77b4&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fet_andyrhony_030918.jpg%3Fh%3Dd1cb525d&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/nup_183067_0217.jpg?h=c7ba77b4", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-06%2F1280_rhony_cruise.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/nup_183067_0217.jpg?h=c7ba77b4", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/why-carole-radziwill-says-shes-leaving-real-housewives-of-new-york-city-106720", "title": "Why Carole Radziwill Says She\u2019s Leaving \u2018Real Housewives of New York City\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/nup_183067_0217.jpg?h=c7ba77b4", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 54-year-old reality star announced her exit from the series on Wednesday.", "title": "Why Carole Radziwill Says She\u2019s Leaving \u2018Real Housewives of New York City\u2019", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/why-carole-radziwill-says-shes-leaving-real-housewives-of-new-york-city-106720", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 54-year-old reality star announced her exit from the series on Wednesday.", "twitter": {"description": "The 54-year-old reality star announced her exit from the series on Wednesday.", "title": "Why Carole Radziwill Says She\u2019s Leaving \u2018Real Housewives of New York City\u2019", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/why-carole-radziwill-says-shes-leaving-real-housewives-of-new-york-city-106720", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/nup_183067_0217.jpg?h=c7ba77b4", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Why Carole Radziwill Says She\u2019s Leaving \u2018Real Housewives of New York City\u2019 | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, The Real Housewives, The Real Housewives of New York City, Carole Radziwill", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
