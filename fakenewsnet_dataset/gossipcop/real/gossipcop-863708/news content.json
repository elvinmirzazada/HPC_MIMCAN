In the photo, as the outlet noted, Bookout was standing next to her husband, Taylor McKinney, and looking to be sporting a baby bump.\n\nAs fans can see in the photo shared below, Bookout looked to be round in her midsection as she held her husband\u2019s hand and placed her other hand halfway into her pocket.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Insider, Maci Bookout was caught photoshopping her midsection weeks ago while celebrating Halloween with her family and never addressed why she did so. She\u2019s also shared a couple of images in which a baby bump was possibly on display.\n\nAfter Bookout shared her most recent suspicious photo, fans began commenting on the post with questions about her potential pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIs that a baby bump?\u201d one person asked.\n\n\u201cWhen are you due?\u201d asked another.\n\nMaci Bookout has remained completely silent in regard to the online rumors regarding her alleged baby bump but over the past several months, she\u2019s made it clear that she is not at all opposed to expanding her family with husband Taylor McKinney.\n\nIn September, during an interview with Us Weekly magazine, Maci Bookout confirmed she and her husband Taylor McKinney are planning to adopt at some point in the future.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely still wanting to adopt. We don\u2019t really have, like, a timeframe or, like, an exact answer,\u201d she said months ago. \u201cI feel like when we know to start the process, we will start it, but for now we\u2019re happy with where we\u2019re at.\u201d\n\nBookout and McKinney currently share two children, 3-year-old Jayde and 2-year-old Maverick, and Bookout is also mom to 10-year-old Bentley, who she shares with former boyfriend Ryan Edwards.\n\n\u201cJayde and Maverick are just Jayde and Maverick. They\u2019re gonna be \u2013 Oh god, I feel bad for the world. Maverick got his first haircut \u2013 had to say bye to the man bun. Sad about that, but I mean, really they\u2019re a trip,\u201d Bookout gushed.\n\nAs for a future pregnancy, Bookout hasn\u2019t said a whole lot, other than she\u2019s open to the idea if it was what her husband wanted.\n\nTo see more of Maci Bookout and her family, tune into new episodes of Teen Mom OG Season 8, which air this and every Monday night at 9 p.m. on MTV.", "images": ["https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/inquisitr_cross.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v3/assets/search-icon.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Cronin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5202729/teen-mom-ogs-maci-bookout-looks-to-have-a-baby-bump-in-new-instagram-photo", "title": "\u2018Teen Mom OG\u2019 Star Maci Bookout Looks To Have A Baby Bump In New Instagram Photo", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Maci Bookout is facing new rumors, which suggest the Teen Mom OG star is expecting her fourth child.
