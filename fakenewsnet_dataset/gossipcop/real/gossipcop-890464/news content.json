The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived at the region separately. Camilla returned from a private holiday, while Charles flew in on a RAF Voyager flight.\n\nIt was a rare moment for the pair, who have only been spotted kissing in public twice: at a polo match in 2005 and before their marriage at a Somerset House reception in 2001. They are touring the region at the request of the Government. The trip serves as an important event leading up to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London next year.\n\nAfter being welcomed by a ceremony of military pomp and pageantry, Charles and Camilla paid their respects to the fallen victims of Singapore's war. They headed to the Cenotaph memorial where they observed a minute's silence with other dignitaries, serving personnel and military veterans.\n\nCharles offered a wreath with the blooms shaped into the Prince of Wales' feathers. He also left a handwritten card in his black lettering with the words: \"In grateful remembrance of your service and sacrifice \u2014 Charles.\"\n\nOver the years, their relationship made headlines and raised several eyebrows. The duo reportedly met in mid-1971 and dated for two years before calling it quits. They had been in an on-and-off relationship for several years, despite the fact that they were both married to different people at the time. Prince Charles was famously married to Princess Diana, while Camilla was wife to Andrew Parker Bowles.\n\nThey both eventually got divorced from their respective spouses and have been together since. Charles and Camilla were married on April 9, 2005.", "images": ["https://cdn.christianpost.com/images/cache/image/13/18/131819_a_66_66.jpg",
