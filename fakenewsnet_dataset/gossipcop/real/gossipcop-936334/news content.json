Gomez met a ton of fans and managed to make another good joke at her Met Gala spray tan that drew a lot of critical tweets because it didn't photograph well on the red carpet. \"I fixed it from Met Gala,\" she quipped of her bronze glow to fans complimenting her appearance.\n\nGomez's first joke about the tan was posted three days after the Met Gala. \"Me when I saw my pictures from MET,\" she wrote with a shrug emoji and footage of her running away.\n\nSelena Gomez at the Met Gala. Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nA source made it clear to People then that Gomez was joking only about the tan and hair, not her dress. \u201cIn person, she honestly felt great but not everything looks the same as it does in person,\u201d the source explained. \u201cShe was just clapping back at people who were commenting on her tan and hair and wanted to make a joke about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nGomez herself shared several videos of herself meeting fans yesterday on her Instagram story. She changed her hair again for the event, making it long with extensions. She appears to still be wearing her cross necklace from the Met Gala, too.\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images", "images":
