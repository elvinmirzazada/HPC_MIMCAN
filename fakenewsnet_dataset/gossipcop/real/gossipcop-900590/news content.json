Singing Christmas Carols with my girl @KellyRowland to the RockStar Patients of @SeattleChildrens. @WhyNotYouFDN #StrongAgainstCancer,\" Ciara captioned a slideshow of her and Rowland rocking out with some of the kids.\n\nCiara and Rowland, both sporting Santa hats with their names on it and matching white sweatshirts, clearly had a great time bringing much-needed smiles to the hospital's patients.\n\n\"What a sweet time cutting the ribbon with Princess Pascuala, handing out Kindles and #deliveringsmiles with @Amazon! @SeattleChildrens @WhyNotYouFDN,\" Ciara captioned another pic, before sharing a special video of herself and Rowland singing \"Jingle Bells\" for a patient named Erin.\n\n\"Thank you so much to @ciara & @seattlechildrens For having me! The smiles I saw yesterday made my heart smile! I had so much fun!!! Can't wait to do it again!\" Rowland wrote on Instagram on Saturday. \"XO.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Ciara has paid a visit to Seattle Children's Hospital.
