Not words I would use to describe u,\" on Tuesday before sharing a handwritten note that appears to be written by Chelsea after she left home.\n\n\"She's 20...not a teen...she is married and pregnant...she doesn't want anything to do with me...great stop...doing interviews go live ur life,\" Rosie wrote in another tweet. \"We have been here before Chelsea...u wanna go a few rounds in public...seems so...Michelle's death = money 4 Chelsea.\"\n\nRosie's ex-wife, Michelle Rounds, died unexpectedly at her home last week. Rosie and Rounds tied the knot when Chelsea was a teenager.\n\n\"I let go...I walked away...and she still does interviews...'do u see me mommy'... I see u Chelsea...hurting people in ur family...over and over,\" Rosie continued, before replying to one user begging her to \"delete these tweets.\" \"No hope I will not...not delete...not regret...she uses the public...she responds only in public...and now I will too.\"\n\n\"Oh honey I am not breaking down I am standing up to tabloid bullsh*t to my vengeful child to the endlessness of this insanity,\" she wrote to another follower, after sharing childhood videos and photos of Chelsea.\n\nThe 55-year-old actress continued to speak out on Wednesday morning, writing, \"What will u do...with no tabloids to call...no one to blame...but u...u child...u...same...same same.\"\n\nSee more on Rosie and Chelsea's tumultuous relationship in the video below.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-06%2Fet_rosiedaughter_062116_1280.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-06/1280_rosie_odonnell_chelsea_541900858_062116.jpg", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2Frosie_odonnell_chelsea_odonnell_gettyimages.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-06%2F1280_rosie_odonnell_chelsea_541900858_062116.jpg&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2Frosie_o_donnell_gettyimages-450303892.jpg%3Fh%3D4a1d0011&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-06/1280_rosie_odonnell_chelsea_541900858_062116.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/rosie-odonnell-responds-vengeful-child-chelseas-recent-interview-u-wanna-go-few-rounds-public-87719", "title": "Rosie O'Donnell Responds to 'Vengeful Child' Chelsea's Recent Interview: 'U Wanna Go a Few Rounds in Public?'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-06/1280_rosie_odonnell_chelsea_541900858_062116.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Chelsea revealed on Tuesday that she is pregnant and that Rosie 'will not have a part in this child's life.'", "title": "Rosie O'Donnell Responds to 'Vengeful Child' Chelsea's Recent Interview: 'U Wanna Go a Few Rounds in Public?'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rosie-odonnell-responds-vengeful-child-chelseas-recent-interview-u-wanna-go-few-rounds-public-87719", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Chelsea revealed on Tuesday that she is pregnant and that Rosie 'will not have a part in this child's life.'", "twitter": {"description": "Chelsea revealed on Tuesday that she is pregnant and that Rosie 'will not have a part in this child's life.'", "title": "Rosie O'Donnell Responds to 'Vengeful Child' Chelsea's Recent Interview: 'U Wanna Go a Few Rounds in Public?'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rosie-odonnell-responds-vengeful-child-chelseas-recent-interview-u-wanna-go-few-rounds-public-87719", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-06/1280_rosie_odonnell_chelsea_541900858_062116.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Rosie O'Donnell Responds to 'Vengeful Child' Chelsea's Recent Interview: 'U Wanna Go a Few Rounds in Public?' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Rosie O Donnell", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
