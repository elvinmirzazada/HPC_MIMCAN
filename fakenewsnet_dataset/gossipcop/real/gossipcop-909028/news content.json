I\u2019m Dave Chappelle. And I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America. Sorry for the interruption. Please continue.\u201d\n\n[protected-iframe id=\u201d4c8cd86ea0882275590e0a5e05f886bb-46934866-65121066\u2033 info=\u201dhttps://players.brightcove.net/769341148/r1La1160g_default/index.html?videoId=5721266188001\u2033 frameborder=\u201d0\u2033 allowfullscreen=\u201d\u201d height=\u201d500px\u201d width=\u201d500px\u201d]\n\nW-O-W!

As Lamar rapped, each of the dancers fell to the ground as gunshot sounds played over the performance. A few minutes later, Lamar would take home the Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Performance for his song \u201cLoyalty,\u201d featuring Rihanna.\n\nWatch the entire performance
