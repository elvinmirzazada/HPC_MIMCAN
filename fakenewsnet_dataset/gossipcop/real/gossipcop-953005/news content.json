{"url": "https://people.com/royals/prince-george-fifth-birthday-coin/", "text": "Prince George, who\u2019s turning 5 on Sunday, is receiving a very special gift!\n\nThe Royal Mint just announced that in honor of George\u2019s birthday on July 22, it will issue a \u00a35 (about $6.50) commemorative coin, available to the public for purchase. The coin features an image of St. George, the patron saint of England, and a dragon. According to legend, the dragon, who lived nearby St. George\u2019s town, would attack the locals, so St. George, a knight, tamed and killed it. The coin, also embossed with the year 2018, is part of a Royal Mint annual set called The Progress of a Prince.\n\nThe legend of St. George and the dragon has been used on royal coins for centuries, according to the Royal Mint, and deliberately invokes courage and the triumph of good over evil as a tribute to the prince on his birthday. On Prince George\u2019s second birthday, the Royal Mint issued a similar coin. Prince George is third in line to the throne\n\nThe Royal Mint\n\nThe Royal Mint\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Prince George Wore Pants for the First Time at Royal Wedding (He\u2019s Only Allowed to Wear Shorts!)\n\nMatt Holyoak/Camera Press/REDUX\n\nPrince George has had a busy summer leading up to his birthday. Just last week, he attended the christening of his little brother, Prince Louis, and stole the show with his big grin in the official portraits. And just a few weeks before, he watched from the sidelines as his dad played in a charity polo at Beaufort Park and attended Trooping the Colour. He was also a page boy at the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/DExjTPk7mwSiJeleZ0XdqWNPS58=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(684x0:686x2)/christening1-67813aecac2a4d09a2b73c946127b03b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/dQ4WIj6wLsfSxne7-90o0zYwz1o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1059x452:1061x454)/royals-George-Charlotte-Louis-031823-2000-9770f78e8952495da126c60dfac374f3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/wXiHLowJ-7Mo642zSFPvxb2oyXs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(281x0:283x2)/prince-george-2-1-ccb69967792549faba3faaa4d8a0cd7d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/MBk2D8Gc8w7OFE72hNydo-xnxIU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/king-charles-royal-maundy-service-040623-6-18d493f8110141b8b06daafbd132a7ab.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/nGggjWO-9sVTMhSi4rWzPyuTcQc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(374x389:376x391)/king-charles-princess-charlotte-112822-056e59a544974895a80ce5d8d7590268.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/_MOBavoQL-pDvPumNyeTei-h1MQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/king-charles-portriat-0512202350b-98a5122af22348b5be96989dbd3ffd53.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/kfuJaXy-VHNWqcStJ6q52yJwjmU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/prince-harry-meghan-markle-3-09409890bfa44a57a159bebbf2df94d6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Br64YQMcMrMIpTQjiFqXqR0tn-E=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x358:941x360)/Royals-Easter-Outing-040923-04-2000-2fc735c17f8048d0a211a7fb1f9afd31.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-gS60FJgj5i0brFAFsZf2iPVBko=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/princess-of-wales-prince-louis-032123-1-8dffc6b557c64919be2817a089bf6b62.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Aowi3Jca1tUKLxQ3vS-t2c8gvGE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(899x385:901x387)/Royals-Easter-Outing-040923-01-2000-f7ba329e2e6644b58d18a9079853beae.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zUYng5ZemSS1XmNNBm_HYS3cesE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x19:751x21)/meghan-1-1-03b3c610ddfd4871a1d7d00c6599a309.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/I5YMo5jsw-Zw_ey4lyM2QRUmgBs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/king-charles-meghan-markle-prince-harry-9922-1604143c620941e99175aa8343de0a1e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/VgkgPlUXo4yLl4NLf2dHJcyEyPs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(899x412:901x414)/Princess-Charlotte-050223-01-c1c0a2b1522246a38eecfd86570a1bf1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7GuPu4fZBfjFVLpDvkP5iOWdfeE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x389:676x391)/prince-louise-050623-e6175f3ed6484c8aabe8dcd22b1a228f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/uFzIZcT8H5-Sn4lyH-K_-yaOUsA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/camilla-queen-consort-king-charles-iii-coronation-balcony-050623-2-6bc08589ddd44cf2b1dc224253336fb0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0TqU-lex4wlVzVPCEvUI1Ca8HiQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(779x0:781x2)/prince-george-1-2000-f2f8eb0df77d46999406c0169e0f1e35.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/DUihaYXABJfYmZA1X9yXU1Vsk6s=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/prince-philip-2-2000-3d8274ff84f34d54b63703016966632a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8QfGh5bMm3fdua3LdAm67KQzgac=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x505:981x507)/Prince-Louis-5th-Birthday-042223-01-2000-87c73d8361914e8f9c9723ea1c1a4fc9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/u8wcfywJZiAphFkDkxwOOK8bO_0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/prince-george-1-3-1de00b226c2740d0bed95ebbccf915cb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/0TqU-lex4wlVzVPCEvUI1Ca8HiQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(779x0:781x2)/prince-george-1-2000-f2f8eb0df77d46999406c0169e0f1e35.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maura Hohman", "Maura Hohman Is A Former News Writer At People.
