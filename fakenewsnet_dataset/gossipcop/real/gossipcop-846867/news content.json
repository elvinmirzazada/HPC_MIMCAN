Mazza (Pittsburgh, PA USA) - See all my reviews\n\nThis book is not only humorous, but also educational. A diagram of the digestive system and other visual aids help to drive home the science of farts. The book is written in a matter-of-fact, totally nonjudgmental tone. The text is supplemented by drawings that have a quirky charm to them. I suppose that some self-appointed watchdogs of \"cultural purity\" will whine and pout about a book that celebrates the fart as a joyous, and even noble, part of life. But for the rest of us, \"The Gas We Pass\" is a treasure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29 of 34 people found the following review helpful: kids book that deals frankly with the mystique of gas, November 14, 2003 , November 14, 2003 By A. Ryan \"Merribelle\" (Westminster, CA USA) - See all my reviews\n\nWith a frank and straightforward style, The Gas We Pass explains in layman's terms the reason our bodies produce gas, how we expel it and why this is a healthy, natural thing. A variety of people and animals are helpfully illustrated eating and farting. There is no sense of shame or mockery in the subtext, which helps children to avoid associating gas with jokes or rudeness. The drawings are a bit amateurish and simple, but they complement the text nicely. In all, not an exciting read, but it does explain this bodily function well for children. To this day my now five year old boy never tells fart jokes.\n\n-Andrea, aka Merribelle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 of 8 people found the following review helpful: The Story of Farts, November 5, 2004 , November 5, 2004 By Bonnie Sayers \"autismfamily\" (Los Angeles, CA) - See all my reviews\n\nThis review is from: The Gas We Pass: The Story of Farts (My Body Science) (Paperback)\n\n\n\nThe book begins with the boy and father getting flown to the ground due to the force of the fart that erupted from this huge Elephant, \" BAAAROOMM\". They were knocked on their butts with the boys' hat being removed from his head due to the force, since Elephant farts are really big.\n\n\n\nThe illustrations are amusing, yet one page I found disturbing and not so much because the boy is standing up in the tub having his penis visible, but the fact that his father is also in the tub. Different cultures do things other ways so I am not sure if this is or was common back in Japan during the 1970s. The reason this illustration of the tub is shown in The Gas We Pass: The Story of Farts, has to do with what happens when you fart while in water. The bubbles rise with the boy looking behind him to see about five bubbles coming out of his rear moving toward the top of the water level. However the father is sitting in the back of the tub and his four bubbles look like they are coming from his stomach, so maybe he burped, although the text states, \" People fart too,\".\n\n\n\nThere are lines around the father in many of the illustrations showing emotions of some kind, perhaps embarrassment from the noises his body emits. His parents each BURP! after the meal while the boy and a pet animal let loose with a fart. There is an illustrated adult body chart that shows the internal organs explaining the path of air and food.\n\n\n\nAnother illustration shows the man holding his nose after cleaning up a rather stinky mess from a lion at the zoo. Every time we go to the zoo we see animals poop droppings waiting to be removed. Too bad the illustration of the lion makes him look not too happy after releasing his fart.\n\n\n\nThis is a silly and educational book for kids to joke about and get comfortable asking questions while perusing the pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare your thoughts with other customers: See all 69 customer reviews...", "images":
