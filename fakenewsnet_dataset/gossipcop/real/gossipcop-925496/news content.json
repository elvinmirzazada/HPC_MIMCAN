TMZ has learned.\n\nBrian appeared on season 7 of \"Road Rules\" back in 1999. His family tells us he was found dead in his Pennsylvania home last Thursday. They believe it was heart failure, and tell us he had a history of arrhythmia.\n\nThe family says the death was not drug or alcohol related -- and, as far as they know, no substances were found in the home.\n\nBrian was 23 years old when he competed on \"Road Rules.\" He didn't win the grand prize of $43k, but he competed on 13 different \"missions\" over the course of 15 episodes while shooting in Mexico, Costa Rica and the United States.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/85/4by3/2023/11/28/85299c59a419494c866f9d7f7afaaca7_md.jpg",
