More specifically, she carried them with her: Lively had a Judith Leiber clutch custom-made with the Reynolds family crest.\n\nIf you look closely, you'll see that Lively's rhinestone-embellished handbag has intricate scenes depicted on either side. On the front, it's classic \"sacred heart\" iconography behind a veiled woman, in keeping with the theme of this year's Costume Institute exhibit, \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\"; on the other, there's a riff on a medieval family crest, which, at the very center of a scroll, reads \"Reynolds.\"\n\nHere's a close-up of both sides of Lively's clutch.\n\nCourtesy of Judith Leiber", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/654a3b45fb5370f1075fdfa4/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed392865d05a333a2d8c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Seamless%2520Sacred%2520Heart%2520Back%2520MET.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed39295117594719a052/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Seamless%2520Sacred%2520Heart%2520Front%2520MET.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed39295117594719a051/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-955783218.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/65526dd28afddb43b3f4146b/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f3c61d01a66b5bdeb03d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-955783218.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/643ace19d62c4e9721df1f4a/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/653fba10234d1d68faa3a117/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed391d01a66b5bdeb037/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-955778036.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Andrea Park"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/blake-lively-met-gala-2018-outfit-hidden-message", "title": "The Hidden Message You Probably Missed in Blake Lively's Met Gala 2018 Outfit", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "At the 2018 Met Gala, Blake Lively carried a clutch decorated with the initials of her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and their daughters, James and Ines.", "id": "5af1ed396cb7e538be078c41", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5af1ed396cb7e538be078c41", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"At the 2018 Met Gala, Blake Lively carried a clutch decorated with the initials of her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and their daughters, James and Ines.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed391d01a66b5bdeb037/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed391d01a66b5bdeb037/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Ryan Reynolds and the couple's daughters were with her in spirit.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "You Probably Missed the Sweet Family Tribute in Blake Lively's Met Gala Outfit", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/blake-lively-met-gala-2018-outfit-hidden-message"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-05-08T19:30:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-05-08T19:30:00.000Z", "author": "Andrea Park"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Ryan Reynolds and the couple's daughters were with her in spirit.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "You Probably Missed the Sweet Family Tribute in Blake Lively's Met Gala Outfit"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525807800.0, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
