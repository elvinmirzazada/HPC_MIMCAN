The former race car driver proposed to the 26-year-old Virginia Beach native during the live finale on Tuesday, March 6, with yet another Neil Lane engagement ring, and we\u2019ve got exclusive details on how Lauren B.\u2019s sparkler compares to the one Luyendyk gave Becca K.\n\nFor his original proposal to Kufrin in Peru, Luyendyk met with celebrity jeweler Neil Lane to select a 4-carat ring. While we didn\u2019t see the Bachelor star meet with Lane for his second go around, we know the ring he presented to Burnham weighed in slightly smaller at 3.65 carats.\n\nRelated: \u2018Bachelor\u2019 and \u2018Bachelorette\u2019 Engagement Rings Through the Years See all the engagement and promise rings ever given on the 'Bachelor' and 'Bachelorette' TV shows!\n\nAs Us Weekly previously reported, Kufrin\u2019s sparkler \u2014 which she returned to Luyendyk when he blindsided her with a breakup in January \u2014 was a platinum set diamond halo ring that featured an additional set of smaller diamonds surrounding the center stone. The band was also completely covered in diamonds.\n\nRelated: \u2018The Bachelor\u2019: All the Details on the Engagement Ring From Season 22 Well, the season 22 of the Bachelor has been quite the journey for Arie Luyendyk Jr. who started out dating 29 women on national television. He whittled his choice down to two women (Becca Kufrin and Lauren Turnham) and proposed to one of the ladies \u2014 and as we reported, later broke it off with [\u2026]\n\nSources tell Us that Burnham\u2019s rock, meanwhile, features a cushion cut diamond accented by two baguette stones with tiny gems surrounding it on all sides. There are also micro-pave stones akin to chips laid into the band \u2014 about 170 in total \u2014 but they don\u2019t go all the way around.\n\nWhile Burnham\u2019s bling certainly looked blinding on TV, these subtle differences mean it is likely worth less than the $80,000 Kufrin\u2019s was estimated to cost.\n\nThank You!
