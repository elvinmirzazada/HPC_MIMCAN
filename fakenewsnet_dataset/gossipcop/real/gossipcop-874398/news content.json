We must talk about it so that we remember how sad, horrific and tragic these moments are.\n\n\u201cTo the people of Spain and Barcelona, I just want to add to the rest of the world outpouring of love and give our thoughts for you.\u201d\n\nJames Corden addressed the terror attack in Barcelona with an emotional message on his show.\n\nThe terror attack occurred when the driver of a rental van charged through a busy street in the Spanish city that was packed with pedestrians. Dozens of people were injured, in addition to the deaths.\n\nThe harrowing act of terror was carried out hours after an explosion took place in a house roughly 60 miles away in an incident law enforcement officials say was related. Four people have been arrested in connection to the attacks.\n\nCorden ended his powerful message Thursday evening by paying tribute to the victims.\n\n\u201cWe are thinking about the victims and their families on what must be unimaginable day of horror for them,\u201d he said.\n\nFellow CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert shared a similar message on his program Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cThis is heartbreaking reminder that evil is real, and that the United States is not alone in fighting it,\u201d Colbert said after sending his thoughts to Barcelona.", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/08/18/45MZRUD42K4BYEQC6EWULKCXPI.jpg?w=1024&h=670"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/08/18/45MZRUD42K4BYEQC6EWULKCXPI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sblendorio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/08/18/james-corden-on-barcelona-we-cant-let-terror-attacks-become-accepted-as-normal/", "title": "James Corden on Barcelona: We can\u2019t let terror attacks become accepted as \u2018normal\u2019", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "The late-night host also honored the victims of Thursday's horrific act of terror.", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "James Corden on Barcelona: We can\u2019t let terror attacks become accepted as \u2018normal\u2019", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/08/18/james-corden-on-barcelona-we-cant-let-terror-attacks-become-accepted-as-normal/", "description": "James Corden honored the victims of Thursday\u2019s horrific terror attack in Barcelona and stressed the importance of not allowing these attacks to be accepted as the norm.
