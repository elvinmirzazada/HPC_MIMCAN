News as she walked the red carpet at the Los Angeles premiere of her upcoming thriller The Beguiled.\n\nThe actress, who turns 50 on June 20, added, \u201cI\u2019ve already been to Australia and saw my mom and it\u2019s too far for her to travel but my sister is coming over with all her children. She has six kids.\u201d\n\nKidman and Urban share two daughters, Sunday, 8, and Faith, 6. She also has two adult children, Isabella, 24, and Connor, 22, from her marriage to Tom Cruise.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it for me,\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t need any big parties; I just need my family around me. If I have my family around me I am happy.\u201d\n\nFrom Coinage: See Where 6 Stars Were Before They Were Famous\n\nBut for the jet-setting Oscar winner, just having a day off would be a gift. Last week, Kidman successfully pulled a red carpet hat-trick, stepping out in support of three events in three days.\n\nShe was at the Hammerstein Ballroom on for the 2017 CFDA Awards, then to London\u2019s Berkeley Square Gardens for the Glamour Women Of The Year awards and finally the CMT Awards in Nashville, where she cheered on Urban and Carrie Underwood during their duet, \u201cThe Fighter.\u201d She also watched her husband win three different awards.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/will-smith-family.jpg?crop=609px%2C168px%2C858px%2C574px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/nicole-kidman6.jpg?w=450", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/tom-felton.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/joe-alwyn.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/brad-pitt1.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1332.7428571429px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/julia-stiles2.jpg?crop=2px%2C31px%2C1303px%2C872px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/nicole-kidman6.jpg?crop=0px%2C24px%2C2817px%2C1481px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/ben-stiller-dodgeball.jpg?crop=166px%2C0px%2C1667px%2C1115.3023809524px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/carrie-fisher-house-tour-gma.jpg?crop=79px%2C0px%2C834px%2C557.98571428571px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/george-clooney1.jpg?crop=165px%2C103px%2C1597px%2C1068px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/nicole-kidman6.jpg?crop=0px%2C24px%2C2817px%2C1481px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614220308/http://people.com/movies/nicole-kidman-reveals-her-50th-birthday-plans-with-divine-husband-keith-urban-and-kids-i-just-need-my-family/", "title": "Nicole Kidman Reveals Her 50th Birthday Plans with 'Divine' Husband Keith Urban and Kids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1143086910", "description": "\"[I want] to hang with my divine husband and my kids and my sister,\" Kidman told E!
