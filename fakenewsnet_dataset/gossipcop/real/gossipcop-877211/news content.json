It's time to burrow into your oversized fuzzy sweaters and wear the same pair of blue jeans Monday through Friday. Fall fashion means figuring out how to layer without looking like an overstuffed penguin and revisiting your favorite transitional-weather gear, from chunky ankle boots to classic trench coats. Ahead, we'll show you how to easily recreate street-style stars' and stylists' fall outfits with minimal effort.\n\n\n\nEntrench It In\n\nWe all know and love a great trench coat for fall. For a fresh take in 2023, opt for a leather version paired with low-rise denim. The edgy look is cool-girl-approved by Doja Cat, who wore the outfit in her \u201cAttention\u201d music video, plus celebrity stylist Aisha Rae. \u201cMy go-to fall outfit is an oversized leather trench jacket, white ribbed tank, and flare low-rise denim or oversized baggy vintage denim with a leather boot or pointy heel,\u201d she says.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nLavish in Luxury\n\nIn 2023, we\u2019ve seen a shift away from trendy, of-the-moment pieces to quality closet staples, or what the fashion world has dubbed \u201cquiet luxury\u201d dressing. While it\u2019s not so much a trend but rather a style aesthetic, the allure of quiet luxury is that it\u2019s steeped in timeless pieces that can be worn year after year. For a fall look, Rae says to think of muted tones, tailored slacks, crisp white button-ups, trench coats, and loafers, and ballet flats.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nLayer It On\n\nFall weather is notoriously unpredictable. One minute, it\u2019s nice and cool, and the next, it\u2019s hot and stuffy. That\u2019s why the art of layering is essential in your fall outfits, says Stitch Fix stylist Gillian McHattie. \u201cTo ensure you\u2019re prepared for unexpected temperature swings, I suggest investing in a light outer layer, like a denim jacket that can be worn for extra warmth over your look,\u201d she says.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nSweater Dress It Up\n\nA failsafe fall outfit is also the easiest: a sweater dress and knee-high boots. Sweater dresses are warm, stylish, and easy to accessorize. All you need is a neutral pair of knee-high boots and your favorite jewelry for this combo. Knee-high boots also work with a knitted mini dress, but when the temps start to dip, the best practice is usually the lower the hemline, the better.\n\n(Image credit: Tyler Joe )\n\nSuit Up\n\nFind a good pantsuit set, and you're ready for any work event or fancy dinner party. The two-piece look is so easy to wear (I like to layer a crop top or tee underneath), and you can rock it with sneakers, mule pumps, boots, or flats. Best of all, you can wear the coordinates separately or together, like this Fashion Week attendee did.\n\n(Image credit: Tyler Joe )\n\nPolished for the Office\n\nA fall outfit for the office doesn\u2019t need to be complicated. McHattie\u2019s go-to office look is easy to replicate. She recommends, \u201cReach for your favorite pair of denim, add a lightweight knit sweater in an eye-catching color on top, and finish off the ensemble with an oversized blazer for a complete look that\u2019s perfect for the office.\u201d\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nPlay With Proportions\n\nA trend Stitch Fix has dubbed Proportion Play is one we anticipate to be huge this fall,\u201d says McHattie. \u201cThis trend is all about embracing oversized, voluminous silhouettes that can be paired with more fitted items to balance the proportions.\u201d We recommend taking after style star Emili Sindlev and going with a giant blazer and fitted skirt. On the flip side, a voluminous skirt and teeny tiny top would work just as well.\n\n(Image credit: Tyler Joe )\n\nEmbrace Apple Girl Autumn\n\nThanks to the runways of fall 2023, we\u2019re seeing the fashion equivalent of TikTok\u2019s \u201cstrawberry girl summer\u201d this fall, dubbed \u201capple girl autumn\u201d by Stitch Fix. Mchattie explains, \u201cApple girl autumn will be marked with pops of red sprinkled throughout people\u2019s wardrobes in a variety of traditional fall textures.\u201d To embrace the trend, add some candy red to your look in the form of hosiery as this fashion week did, or go with a red handbag or shoes.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nSlip On a Slip\n\nSlip dresses are the ultimate seasonless outfit. Wear them alone during the spring and summer, then come fall and winter, go crazy with layering. Opt for a thin turtleneck underneath and a trench coat, or we especially love Pernille Teisbaeck's grungy leather jacket and moto boots combo.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nDouble the Denim\n\nWe all thought Britney and JT's denim was a bit too much in 2001, but now an all-denim look is the way to go. It's effortlessly cool and so easy to put together. Just pair your favorite jean jacket or shirt with some slouchy jeans, and you're good to go. You can even throw on a long denim skirt for a look mainly of the moment.\n\n(Image credit: Tyler Joe )\n\nWear a Dress Over Jeans\n\nMy favorite fall combination is a dress over jeans because I'm not a fan of tights. (They always rip!) This simple combination ensures you can wear your Free People summer dress and fall jeans without picking favorites. Regarding what kind of denim you should wear underneath, go for a straight or slim fit with a cropped or cuffed hem for extra style points.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nThink Wide\n\nYear after year, we\u2019re seeing denim trends move in favor of wider-legged styles. McHattie says Stich Fix sales on wide-leg pants have doubled this year, so now\u2019s as good a time to try the style as any. \u201cMy favorite way to style loose denim or trousers is with a fitted bodysuit or a boxy cropped tee,\u201d McHattie adds.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nGo Grunge\n\nRemember when we all wore too much eyeliner, Hot Topic was our stomping grounds at the mall, and Avril Lavigne was our style icon? Well, Rae says that aesthetic is making the rounds in the fall outfits of Gen-Zers, and we\u2019re here for it. \u201cMini plaid tennis skirts, chunky black studded belts with silver chains, oversized wide-leg trousers, and band t-shirts we\u2019ll be seeing trending this fall.\u201c\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nBreak Out Your Summer Skirt\n\nPause! Don't pack away your summer skirts yet. You can rework them for fall in several different ways: 1. Find a sweater thin enough to tuck into your skirt, 2. Wear a pair of tights underneath your skirt, 3. Style with the ankle or knee-high boots of your choice. Top with your favorite transitional jacket, and voil\u00e0! Your skirt is now ready for #OOTD photos at the pumpkin patch.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nAdd a Pop of Barbie Pink\n\nFall color trends for 2023 point to neutrals like muted grey and caramel brown, but that's not to say Barbiecore hot pink won't be sticking around for the season. \"We will be seeing the color pink more this fall after the hit movie \"Barbie\" with all the Barbie brand deals and partnerships from this summer,\" says Rae. \"Pops of pink will be everywhere!\" With an outfit full of neutral tones, add some color with a hot pink bag or shoes.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nGet Matchy Matchy\n\nMatching sets are the holy grail for lazy dressers since they require zero thought. Just throw on the top and matching bottoms, and you're ready. For chillier temps, go with pants and a blazer, or when the weather teeters back to warm (as it often does in the fall), opt for a matching skirt set. It doesn't get easier than a matching set.\n\n(Image credit: Tyler Joe )\n\nAccessorize a Jumpsuit\n\nJust like dresses, jumpsuits are a one-and-done outfit. You just have to throw it on, and you're ready to go out the door. It also couldn't be easier to elevate a jumpsuit\u2014throw on your favorite boots and belts and top it all off with a structured bag, and you've got a trendy outfit with minimal effort.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nGo All Black\n\nWhen in doubt, go all black. No matter the season, black is undoubtedly chic (although we may not recommend dressing head-to-toe black on a hot, sunny day). To make your look more attractive, mix up your textures on top and bottom, such as a furry coat worn with subtly-striped trousers.\n\n(Image credit: Tyler Joe )\n\nMake It Sporty\n\nDon't be afraid of turning your athleisure into a bonafide style moment. I promise you can be comfy and stylish at the same time. Just throw on your favorite track pants and add a chic blazer. The outfit combo may be unexpected, but it's still so cool.\n\n(Image credit: Tyler Joe )\n\nWear Your Button-Down With a Sequin Skirt\n\nGive your beloved button-down shirt a new life on the weekend with a shimmery skirt like this sequin number. You'll look instantly dressy for whatever going-out plans you have. If your office dress code is more lax, you might even be able to get away with this look come Monday morning.\n\n(Image credit: Tyler Joe )\n\nMeet the Stylists\n\nAisha Rae Social Links Navigation Celebrity Stylist Aisha Rae starting her career in New York City and now living in Los Angeles as a bi-coastal stylist extends her services in television, commercial, celebrity, and editorial.
