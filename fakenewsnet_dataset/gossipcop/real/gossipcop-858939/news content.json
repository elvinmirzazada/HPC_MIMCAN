Check out the biggest moments from the dramatic reunion below.\n\nRelated: Teen Mom Stars, Then and Now It\u2019s been quite a journey for the cast of Teen Mom. The series launched in December 2009 as the first spinoff from MTV\u2019s 16 and Pregnant. The debut season followed the lives of Maci Bookout, Catelynn Lowell, Amber Portwood and Farrah Abraham, who all experienced very different journeys during their teen pregnancies. On season 5, [\u2026]\n\nMaci Thinks Ryan Is Using Again\n\nMaci and Ryan each got their chance to talk about yet another tumultuous year attempting to coparent. Maci has been asking her ex to take a drug test nearly all season so he could see their child, but said she doesn\u2019t believe he is clean.\n\nHowever, Ryan completely disagrees. \u201cI wonder if she believes the lies she tells?\u201d Ryan muttered backstage.\n\nHe talked about his struggle with rehab, admitting that he ended his treatment early and hasn\u2019t really done any post-rehab therapy to help control his addiction. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how I was going to get out and actually stay clean,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nRelated: Stars Who Have Battled Mental Health Demi Lovato, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jon Hamm, Carrie Fisher, and Ashley Judd are among the many celebrities who've admitted to struggling with depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder\n\nWhen it was time for the two to come together onstage, Ryan wouldn\u2019t have any of it. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting out here with her,\u201d he said. Hopefully, he calms down during part two so they can try to work out some of their problems.\n\nAmber Discussed Her Relapse\n\nAmber Skyped in to talk about her life, including her dramatic breakup from Matt. She was in such a dark place after being \u201cmentally and physically\u201d abused by him for years that she stumbled in her sobriety and started drinking again. \u201cI definitely was trying to drown my sorrows,\u201d Amber said.\n\nAlso, she gushed about Andrew Glennon, the father of her soon-to-be born baby, adding that he is her soul mate and, in a way, saved her life. \u201cHe really picked me up before I started doing drugs again,\u201d Amber said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Andrew, I don\u2019t even know if I would be here right now.\u201d\n\nCatelynn and Maci Diss Farrah\n\nMaci and Catelynn were the only two moms physically at the reunion, so they got a chance to discuss Farrah Abraham\u2018s exit from the show without fear of being attacked by their former costar.\n\n\u201cI feel like she\u2019s always wanted to go down the direction she\u2019s going down so if that\u2019s what she wants to do then that\u2019s probably what she needs to stay doing,\u201d Catelynn said.\n\nMaci was not as diplomatic and said it was so much \u201cnicer\u201d to do the reunion without Farrah there, adding that they also \u201cweren\u2019t really allowed\u201d to talk to Farrah\u2019s daughter. Someone is still bitter!\n\nCatelynn Talks About Her Depression\n\nCatelynn discussed her difficult year \u2014 her miscarriage, her suicidal thoughts and being in treatment away from her family.
