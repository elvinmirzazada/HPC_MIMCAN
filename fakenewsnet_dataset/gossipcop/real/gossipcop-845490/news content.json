At the time, the singer also admitted to having smoked marijuana and taken prescription medication.\n\nThat arrest came amidst a spate of legal trouble for the young Biebs, who also faced charges that year for egging a neighbor's home in Calabasas, California, and dangerous driving during a date with Selena Gomez, in his hometown in Canada.\n\n\n\nNEWS: Justin Bieber Gets Giant Eagle Tattoo On His Stomach\n\nThankfully, Bieber seems to have kept himself largely out of trouble and on the right side of the law more recently. Instead, he's focusing on his Purpose world tour -- and there may even be some new music in the works, according to snaps the singer shared to social media earlier this month.\n\nTake a peek at what the Biebs is teasing in the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2023-11/Eddie_Murphy_GettyImages-1808819136_300.jpg?h=6c83441f", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-655139.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-655725.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-654516.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-655243.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-655554.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-655189.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-655244.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-654339.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-654685.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-655706.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2023-11/DWTSsemifinals_GettyImages-1808574360_300.jpg?h=04d92ac6", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-655506.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-655521.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-654503.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-654517.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-655655.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/et_0423_SocialStudy4_720.png.jpg", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/et_0423_SocialStudy4_720.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-654501.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-655245.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-655098.png"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/et_0423_SocialStudy4_720.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lynda Brendish"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/215881_justin_bieber_looks_back_at_2014_arrest", "title": "Justin Bieber Looks Back at 2014 Arrest: 'Thank God I'm Not Where I Used to Be'", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "Biebs is in a much better place now!", "keywords": "News, Justin Bieber", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/215881_justin_bieber_looks_back_at_2014_arrest", "title": "Justin Bieber Looks Back at 2014 Arrest: 'Thank God I'm Not Where I Used to Be'", "description": "Biebs is in a much better place now!", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/et_0423_SocialStudy4_720.png", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "description": "Biebs is in a much better place now!", "title": "Justin Bieber Looks Back at 2014 Arrest: 'Thank God I'm Not Where I Used to Be'", "creator": "Lynda Brendish", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/215881_justin_bieber_looks_back_at_2014_arrest", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/et_0423_SocialStudy4_720.png"}, "Generator": "Drupal 9 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
