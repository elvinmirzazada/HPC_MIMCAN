William Hutchinson of the Palm Springs Police Department tells ET that the incident in question happened around 9 p.m. at the Saguaro Hotel.\n\nPalm Springs Police Department via Getty Images\n\nThe 46-year-old actor -- who has had numerous run-ins with the law in the past, including four arrests in 2015 -- allegedly pulled the woman's arm and then her hair after getting into an argument.\n\nPolice tell ET that the woman has two other protective orders against Brendon in both New York and Florida. The order allows Brendon to be near the woman, but prohibits him from threatening, harassing, injuring or assaulting her.\n\nBrendon was released from custody on Oct. 12 on a $50,000 bail bond, according to booking records. He is scheduled to appear in court on Nov. 28.\n\nET reached out to Brendon's rep, who had no comment.\n\nIn December 2015, the actor plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief at the Saratoga Springs City Court in New York after allegedly choking his girlfriend in a hotel room three months earlier.\n\nThe judge reportedly ruled that Brendon, -- who has long struggled with substance abuse and depression -- would not serve jail time pending completion of drug and alcohol counseling and avoiding trouble with the law for a year.\n\nFor more on Brendon's battle with depression and addiction, which he opened up about to Dr. Phil in 2015, check out the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-09/bill_cosby_mugshot_2018.jpg?h=9cbee7f4&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fnicholas_brendon_gettyimages-463105548.jpg%3Fh%3D854a7be2&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/nicholas_brendon_gettyimages-463105548.jpg?h=854a7be2", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-09%2Fbill_cosby_mugshot_2018.jpg%3Fh%3D9cbee7f4&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2015-10%2F640_nicholas_brendon_173470599.jpg&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/nicholas_brendon_gettyimages-463105548.jpg?h=854a7be2", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-star-nicholas-brendon-arrested-for-alleged-domestic-violence-against-89499", "title": "'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' Star Nicholas Brendon Arrested for Alleged Domestic Violence Against Girlfriend", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/nicholas_brendon_gettyimages-463105548.jpg?h=854a7be2", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The actor was arrested in Palm Springs last week on charges of domestic violence and violating a protective order.", "title": "'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' Star Nicholas Brendon Arrested for Alleged Domestic Violence Against Girlfriend", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-star-nicholas-brendon-arrested-for-alleged-domestic-violence-against-89499", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The actor was arrested in Palm Springs last week on charges of domestic violence and violating a protective order.", "twitter": {"description": "The actor was arrested in Palm Springs last week on charges of domestic violence and violating a protective order.", "title": "'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' Star Nicholas Brendon Arrested for Alleged Domestic Violence Against Girlfriend", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-star-nicholas-brendon-arrested-for-alleged-domestic-violence-against-89499", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/nicholas_brendon_gettyimages-463105548.jpg?h=854a7be2", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' Star Nicholas Brendon Arrested for Alleged Domestic Violence Against Girlfriend | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Nicholas Brendon", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
