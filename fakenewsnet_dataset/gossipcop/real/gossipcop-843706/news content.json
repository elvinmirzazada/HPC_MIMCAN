From the piles of Dove bar soap and rows of body wash to the expansive lotion and scrub selections, we're pretty sure Cardi's at-home drugstore will have everyone answering her question with a resounding \"yes.\"\n\n02 of 29 GWYNETH PALTROW Gwyneth Paltrow/Instagram; Inset: Amy Sussman/Getty In addition to being stocked with all her Goop skincare goodies, the wellness guru's minimal medicine cabinet contains plenty of other \"non-toxic and clean\" essentials. Some standouts: the Vintner's Daughter Active Botanical Serum, Harklinikken Hair Extract, OLAS Mouthwash, Jao Goe Oil Body Oil and Kosas Kosasport Lip Balm.\n\n03 of 29 JANUARY JONES January Jones/Instagram; Presley Ann/Getty While her son was sick with strep throat, the actress purged products in her beauty collection to narrow it down to two (very packed!) medicine cabinets. \"I feel way lighter,\" she said on Instagram. Among her favorites that made the cut: iS Clinical Cleansing Complex, iS Clinical Active Serum, Sisley Paris Black Rose Facial Oil, Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Concentrate, Dermalogica Sleep Cocoon and multiple Sisley Paris moisturizers.\n\n05 of 29 KYLIE JENNER KIM KARDASHIAN/Instagram; Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images To no one's surprise, Kylie Jenner keeps plenty of Kylie Cosmetics and KKW Beauty products front and center on her makeup counter (including the Kylie Cosmetics Burgundy Extended Palette, KKW Beauty Contour Palette and KKW Beauty Baking Powders), but that's not all she loves. Kylie appears to use a combination of the Beautyblender Bounce Foundation and Too Faced Born This Way Foundation as her base. She also gravitates towards the Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance Palette and holds onto her makeup artist Hrush Achemyan's Tarte palette (which was a limited edition launch a few years ago).\n\n07 of 29 CHRISSY TEIGEN Chrissy Teigen/Instagram; Inset: Getty Chrissy stocks her shower with six essentials: Ouai Shampoo and Conditioner, Olaplex Bond Perfector No. 2, Ouai Scalp & Body Scrub and two bottles of iS Clinical's Cleansing Complex.\n\n09 of 29 KATHERINE HEIGL Thoseheavenlydays.com; Inset: Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage Katherine recently discovered Eminence skincare, and hasn't stopped using it thanks to the glowing results she's seen. \"The line isn't cheap, but it is well worth it since the products really do what they advertise,\" she said on her blog, where she revealed her favorite beauty finds. Her top picks include the Clear Skin Probiotic Cleanser, Bright Skin Licorice Root Booster, Bamboo Firming Fluid, Bright Skin Moisturizer and Bearberry Eye Repair cream. Besides her one-brand skincare regimen, she's currently obsessed with the IT Cosmetics pressed powder, Fenty Beauty's shimmer stick and Anastasia Beverly Hills' brow pencil.\n\n10 of 29 LEA MICHELE Lea Michele/Instagram; Getty Lea's pre-performance beauty essentials include an Artis brush and beautyblender to apply her makeup, the Stila Convertible Color Dual Lip & Cheek Palette for a pop of color, a Wander Beauty dual-sided bronzer and illuminator and her trustee Beachwaver curling iron.\n\n11 of 29 JESSICA ALBA Jessica Alba/Instagram; Inset: Broadimage/REX/Shutterstock The soon-to-be mom of three keeps her nighttime ritual low key when she's on the road: she hydrates her body with her own Honest Organic Body Oil ($9.95), freshens up with Lavinila Labs natural deodorant ($14) and brushes her teeth with her gold Quip toothbrush ($40).\n\n12 of 29 KIM KARDASHIAN Source: Kim Kardashian/Instagram; Inset: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Kim Kardashian stores her makeup just like the rest of us \u2014 in a cluttered drawer. The star shared a snap of her go-to preoducts with the caption \"When did I become this person?\" Her makeup stash features her iconic KKW Beauty Creme Contour and Highlighter kit and if you look closely there seems to be what looks like a new addition to her line: a KKW Beauty dual-sided powder brush (middle right). Could this mean the next product we'll be dying to get our hands on will be a powder? A few other of her faves include: Kylie Cosmetics Kylighters, Kylie Cosmetics Take Me on Vacation KyShadow, Tarte Shape Tape Concealer, and Benefit Cosmetics Hoola Matte Bronzer.\n\n13 of 29 KIM KARDASHIAN (CONT.) Source: Kim Kardashian/ Snapchat; Inset: Buckner/WWD The reality TV star has a daily two-hour glam sesh, so you know she's not just slapping on sunscreen and running out the door.

But when it comes to her personal makeup stash, she doesn't discriminate. The star shared a peek at what she keeps stocked on her vanity (spoiler, it's a lot of blushes): Illuminate by Ashley Tisdale cream blushes and powder highlighters, multiple blushes by NARS, the Too Faced Love Flush blush in I Will Always Love You, Anastasia Beverly Hills' Modern Renaissance palette and concealer by the brand, Benefit's Hoola bronzer, Urban Decay's Naked Illuminated Powder, Tatcha's Luminous Dewy Skin Mist and plenty more.\n\n15 of 29 ASHLEY TISDALE Ashley Tisdale/Instagram;Inset: Tibrina Hobson/Getty And Ashley's secret to flawless skin? Besides water, these luxury essentials. \"My skincare, the most important thing besides water,\" she said on Instagram. Her ride or die favorites include plenty of products from La Mer (like The Moisturizing Soft Lotion, Cr\u00e8me de la Mer Moisturizing Cream and The Eye Concentrate), Sisley's All Day All Year Essential Day Care cream and products from dermatologist Christie Kidd's line.\n\n16 of 29 DREW BARRYMORE Drew Barrymore/Instagram As a self-proclaimed \"beauty junkie,\" we're not surprised to see the Flower Beauty founder's bathroom cabinet overflowing with products. A few standouts: the M-61 Power Glow Peel Pads, GlamGlow's Thirstymud Hydrating Treatment, Nivea Moisturizing Cr\u00e9me, SKII's Facial Treatment Essence and Cetaphil cleanser.\n\n17 of 29 CHRISTINA RICCI Christina Ricci/Instagram; Inset: Jamie McCarthy/Getty This actress calls her arsenal of skincare products her \"little soldiers,\" and we couldn't agree more.

The result? Lots of beach-friendly faves, including Sun Bum Beach Formula Conditioner, St. Tropez In-Shower Gradual Tan and more.\n\n19 of 29 LUPITA NYONG'O Lupita Nyong'o/Instagram; Inset: Getty \"The Bare Necessities,\" the Jungle Book star captioned the behind-the-scenes snapshot, featuring her fave Lanc\u00f4me products (she's one of many gorgeous faces of the French beauty giant) of the moment: a fuchsia-hued Lip Shaker, vibrant Shine Lover lipstick and chic palette.\n\n20 of 29 JOURDAN DUNN Jourdan Dunn/Instagram; Inset: Getty The secret to supermodel skin? A cocktail of high- and low-end products, according to Dunn. From London's cult fave Pixi Glow Tonic to the eco-friendly Tata Harper Purifying Cleanser, the model finds her complexion's balance in a variety of skin treats at every price point.\n\n21 of 29 ASHLEY TISDALE Ashley Tisdale/ Snapchat; Inset: JB Lacroix/ WireImage The actress just launched her very own makeup line with BH Cosmetics, Illuminate by Ashley Tisdale, so it makes perfect sense she has incorporated some of the collection's core products into her everyday beauty routine. Her current fave? The Beach Goddess Eye & Cheek palette, which she tops with a few coats of M.A.C Cosmetics In Extreme Dimension Lash Mascara.\n\n22 of 29 ROSIE HUNTINGTON-WHITELEY Rosie Huntington-Whiteley/Instagram; Inset: WENN \"I carry just enough to give me quick and easy results before landing,\" the supermodel told The Violet Files of her in-flight essentials, including floral favorites Santa Maria Novella Acqua di Rose, Chantecaille\u00b9s Rose de Mai moisturizer and By Terry Baume de Rose.\n\n23 of 29 WHITNEY PORT Source: Whitney Port/Instagram; Inset: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty How does the former The Hills star maintain her So-Cal glow?

When she's not relying on glam help from BFF and makeup artist Lauren Andersen, Alba gets red carpet-ready with her own kit, filled with the brand's Concealer Duo, Cr\u00e8me Blush and a sheer pink Truly Kissable Lip Crayon.\n\n26 of 29 LUCY HALE Lucy Hale/Instagram; Inset: Getty The drama of the Pretty Little Liars star's mega lashes starts before the first swipe, thanks to of a studded eyelash curler and a gilded tube of mascara.
