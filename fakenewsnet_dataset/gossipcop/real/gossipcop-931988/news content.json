This year, though, the party was shut down before it started.\n\nOn March 16, the Met Gala was indefinitely postponed. A new date has not yet been announced. The last time the Met Gala was postponed was in 2002, and that was because of the 9/11 attacks the prior year, The Hollywood Reporter's Lindsay Weinberg reported.\n\nDubbed the Oscars of the East, the Met Gala is an annual event, hosted the first Monday in May, which celebrates the Metropolitan Museum of Art's newest exhibition at the Costume Institute.\n\nLast year's theme was \"Camp: Notes on Fashion,\" and saw over 200 pieces on display, featuring high-end designers from Alexander McQueen and Karl Lagerfeld to John Galliano and Virgil Abloh. The exhibition focused on exaggerated fashion. \"Camp fashion can be humorous, ironic, or simply extreme in its nature,\" wrote Lauren Alexis Fisher for Harper's Bazaar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year's planned Met Gala theme was \"About Time: Fashion and Duration,\" and it was set to be sponsored by Louis Vuitton and Cond\u00e9 Nast.\n\nThe cost to make an appearance during fashion's biggest night out is a steep one, and the cost to make the event happen is even bigger. For a reported $30,000 per ticket, those who passed Wintour's approval can attend the roughly $3.5 million event.\n\nAnd that's just the beginning of all the money that goes into \u2014 and comes out of \u2014 what Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley refers to as \"the Super Bowl of fashion.\"\n\nTake an inside look at the money behind the Met Gala.", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5e6fd676c4854016e01e5862?width=700", "https://i.insider.com/5ae8d3a119ee8629008b4a2b?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5cd19704021b4c7d4e583edc?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5cd194f8021b4c0a3b6179a4?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/privacy-options.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5cd18f67021b4c6cf536fa55?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/rebrand/newsletter-bull.png", "https://i.insider.com/5cd18eec021b4c08183e734c?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5af1b2dd19ee8626008b49a0?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/newsletters/insider-today-logo.png", "https://i.insider.com/5cd18fc9021b4c5ec779b786?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5cd19124021b4c728f398b9a?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5cd1968b021b4c0ac3694189?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5cd19310021b4c7312021e14?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5cd18df5021b4c085e6a0953?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=lifestyle", "https://i.insider.com/5cd1949b021b4c73a146fd0a?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5ae8ce5619ee8628008b4766?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5cd18dab021b4c5e251174c8?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5cd190c1021b4c6d3b362d33?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5cd19207021b4c74f36daa7b?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5cd1960e021b4c79265f9693?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5eb069a042278d14f36d1786?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5eb069a042278d14f36d1786?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower", "Dominic-Madori Davis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/met-gala-2018-theme-cost-ticket-dress-jewlery-2018-5", "title": "The party of the year for the fashion world was scheduled to take place today.
