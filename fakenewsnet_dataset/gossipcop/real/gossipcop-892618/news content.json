Barnes accused the actor \u201cof implied inappropriate behavior,\u201d according to Deadline.\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon Studios, the production company behind the Jill Soloway-created dramedy, confirmed to the outlet that they have launched an investigation.\n\n\u201cAnything that would diminish the level of respect, safety and inclusion so fundamental to our workplace is completely antithetical to our principles,\u201d Soloway told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWe are cooperating with the investigation into this matter.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Jeffrey Tambor Dedicates His SAG Award to Transgender Men and Women\n\nThe allegations against Tambor come more than a month after the former head of Amazon Studios, Roy Price, resigned following a sexual harassment claim that was brought against him.\n\nIn mid-October, The Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Isa Hackett \u2014 daughter of author Philip K. Dick and executive producer of Amazon series Man in the High Castle \u2014 in which she alleged Price propositioned her at San Diego Comic-Con in 2015.\n\nHackett said she was \u201cinspired\u201d to go public with the incident following the \u201cbraver\u201d women who came forward with accusations against disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein.", "images":
