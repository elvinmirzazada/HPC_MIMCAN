We are making progress,\u201d he reiterated.\n\nCBS however once again did not greenlight any new shows fronted by a woman. Senior EVP Thom Sherman \u2014 also new to his post \u2014 reminded that a year ago there were \u201cseveral female-led\u201d pilots (that didn\u2019t move forward), before adding: \u201cI feel confident that we will be successful\u201d in improving that representation.\n\nSpeaking of diversity, Kahl was asked to revisit Hawaii Five-0\u2018s big shake-up. Grace Park and Daniel Dae Kim parted ways with the show in late June, when their reported request for salary parity with series leads Alex O\u2019Loughlin and Scott Caan were not met. In a Facebook post about his \u201cdifficult choice not to continue,\u201d Kim told fans, \u201cThe path to equality is rarely easy.\u201d In response, showrunner Peter M. Lenkov said that H50 had been \u201cextremely generous and proactive in their renegotiation talks,\u201d offering \u201cunprecedented raises, but in the end they chose to move on.\u201d\n\nKahl echoed that at TCA, saying, \u201cWe love both those actors and did not want to lose them. We made very, very strong attempts to keep them,\u201d offering \u201can awful lot of money.\u201d But the reality, with long-running dramas, he said, is \u201csometimes you lose cast members.\u201d As the CSIs, Grey\u2019s Anatomy and SVU have all experienced, \u201cAt some point there\u2019s some cast turnover.\u201d", "images":
