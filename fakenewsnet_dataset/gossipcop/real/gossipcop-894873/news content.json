What is your opinion regarding this?\"\n\nI feel everyone in the world should have a right to be a parent.

What lesson will you take back with you?\", to which Chhillar responded:\n\nThese days that I have spent with my fellow contestants has been the most dynamic period of my life. The only thing that was certain during the whole experience was uncertainty. The one belief that I would take back with me is that, yes...I can change the world. When I entered Miss India, there was only passion. However, through this journey, I acquired a vision in life. That vision and the belief that I can change the world, is something I'm going to take back with me.[19][20]\n\nShe later went on to win the contest's main title Femina Miss India World 2017, in the finale event venued in Yash Raj Film Studio, on 25 June 2017.

When you talk about salary, I don't think it's just about cash, but the love and respect that you give to someone. My mother has been the biggest inspiration in my life. All mothers, they just sacrifice so much for their kids. So, I believe the profession which deserves the highest salary, respect and love should be of a mother.[27][28]\n\nOn 18 November 2017, Chhillar was crowned Miss World 2017 by outgoing titleholder Miss World 2016, Stephanie Del Valle from Puerto Rico in the finals in Sanya, China.
