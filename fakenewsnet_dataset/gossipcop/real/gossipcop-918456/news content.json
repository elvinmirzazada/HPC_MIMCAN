It said she loved to sing, so my mom who raised me would find any way to let me perform.\u201d\n\nYoung says she spent her youth in Asheville, North Carolina, learning ballet and tap dancing and performing at school and church.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale, Young \u2013 who grew up with the first name Amy \u2013 spent a few years doing theater in New York before making the move to Los Angeles in 2000 to pursue TV and film work.\n\n\u201cWhen I went to join the Screen Actors Guild, there was already an Amy Young so I had to register under a different name,\u201d says Young. \u201cI tried to become Susanna or Violet or something fabulous, but it just didn\u2019t feel like I could carry the ruse off.\u201d\n\nSo the actress turned to her family for inspiration.\n\n\u201cMy first [adoptive] dad died when I was 15, and his best friend, Bill, did all the dad stuff with me, so I did a mushing of our names,\u201d Young says. \u201cI felt like I could get away with it because I\u2019m Southern.\u201d\n\nAfter years of hopping from project to project, Young was given the opportunity to audition for the role of Mellie on Scandal. The character only had a few lines in the pilot episode, but Young says she showed up at the first table read for the season excited to work.\n\n\u201c[Creator Shonda Rhimes] came around afterward and told everyone what their arc would be for that first season. She got to me, and I was so happy. Then she told me she thought I\u2019d be in about three episodes. She wanted to write a presidential divorce,\u201d Young recalls.\n\n\u201cI died inside when I heard that. But I kept a smile on my face and showed up to work every day. At some point, they decided it was fun to write stuff for me,\u201d continues Young, who has also released an album of cover songs called Far Away So Close. \u201cI\u2019m having such a good time. I don\u2019t want it to ever end.\u201d\n\nFor more of Young\u2019s story, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Why Bellamy Young Said Olivia Pope Would Be
