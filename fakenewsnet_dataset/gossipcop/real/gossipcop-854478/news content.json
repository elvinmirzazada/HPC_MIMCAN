She\u2019s back for this season\u2019s Bachelorette premiere, but don\u2019t expect any topless photo shoots or whipped cream shenanigans \u2014 she\u2019s just there to give some advice to leading lady Rachel Lindsay as she prepares to embark on her journey to find love.\n\n\u201cI was lucky to come out of Nick\u2019s season with amazing friends,\u201d gushes Lindsay, 31, in a sneak peek at Monday\u2019s premiere first shared by E! News. \u201cThey know exactly what I went through, they know what it\u2019s like to go through this process, so their advice to me is crucial going into tonight.\u201d\n\nLindsay then sits down with a few of her fellow Bachelor alums, including Olympios, Raven Gates, Alexis Waters and Kristina Schulman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nervous to meet the guys,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019m nervous just for the whole thing to kick off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like you need to totally let your feelings be in control of all of this,\u201d advises Olympios. \u201cYou need to give them all a chance and let your feelings be like, \u2018Yep!\u2019 or \u2018Nope!\u2019 \u201d\n\nWaters \u2014 who famously showed up in a dolphin costume on Nick Viall\u2018s season \u2014 also has an important piece of advice for Lindsay.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t judge anybody if they come in a costume,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause they might be the most amazing person ever.\u201d (She\u2019s not wrong.)\n\nFROM PEN: Nick Viall on His \u2018Emotional Rollercoaster\u2019 Proposal to Vanessa Grimaldi\n\nAs for Lindsay? She promises to do her best to keep an open mind.\n\n\u201cOne of my fears is that I might let someone go who I didn\u2019t give a fair chance to,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019m trying so hard to not get in my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that I was extremely skeptical,\u201d she says, reflecting on her time on Viall\u2019s season. \u201cI had a date week five, but Raven had a date week four. And I\u2019ll never forget this \u2014 I wanted to ask advice, and you were so forthcoming. Your advice to me was: \u2018Rachel, you just have to let yourself fall.\u2019 That was a turning point for me. That\u2019s when I started to be open and vulnerable.\u201d\n\nStay tuned!
