Kate Middleton has \"safely delivered a son\" at 11:01 a.m. London time (around 6:01 a.m. ET), Kensington Palace announced. The baby weights 8 lbs, 7 oz. Prince William was present for the birth. Middleton and the new prince are \"both doing well,\" according to the palace.\n\nRelated Story What Name Will Royal Baby Boy Have?\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal post, 4:35 a.m.: Kensington Palace announced on April 23 that Kate Middleton has gone into labor, and has been admitted to the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital in London.\n\nThe Telegraph is reporting that \"shortly after 8.20am, Kensington Palace said the Duchess travelled to the hospital by car and was in the 'early stages of labour.' Royal watchers will be expecting a swift delivery.\"\n\nThe child will be fifth in line to the throne, following four-year-old big brother, Prince George (who is third in line) and two-year-old big sister Princess Charlotte (who is fourth).\n\nKensington Palace first announced that the Duchess of Cambridge was expecting in September 2017. \"The Queen and members of both families are delighted with the news,\" the statement read.\n\nAt the same time, the palace revealed that Middleton was suffering from Hyperemesis Gravidarum, acute morning sickness, which forced her to sit out of a few royal and personal events, including Prince George's first day of school.\n\nAfter a brief hiatus, the Duchess returned to her royal obligations in October (and debuted a tiny baby bump). Since then, she'd participated in a number of public engagements, including an official tour to Sweden and Norway, the BAFTA Awards, and her first official event with Meghan Markle. Middleton had her last working day before giving birth on March 22, when she kicked off her maternity leave.\n\nMiddleton on her last working day before maternity leave Getty Images\n\nThe new little royal also marks the sixth great-grandchild for Queen Elizabeth II. The seventh is also expected to arrive this year, as the Queen's granddaughter Zara Tindall and her husband Mike are expecting their expecting their second child.\n\nCongratulations to the ever-growing royal family! We wonder if we'll see William and Kate's Little one at the royal wedding next month.\n\nWant more royals?
