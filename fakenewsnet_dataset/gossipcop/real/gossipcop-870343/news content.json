No big deal, but I created another human being and then delivered him into the world at 12:30am Thursday morning. Timmy and I named the little man Sonny and I\u2019m in love. Over the next few blog posts I\u2019ll tell you all about the entire day, the following days at the hospital and bringing him home, but for now I just want to talk about how I\u2019m feeling.\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard mothers give the same speech about how life changing the love for your baby is, and it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t believe it or anything, but I guess I couldn\u2019t actually connect to those exact feelings until the doctor placed Sonny onto my chest. I love him and feel protective over him, but more than anything, I\u2019m just like obsessed. I can\u2019t stop looking at him, or thinking about him when I am in another room. It\u2019s a bit like getting a toy you really really wanted as a child. There was all the anticipation and build up, and then you open it and you love it. Unlike the toy, however, I am obviously never going to get sick of Sonny, and he poops. All kidding aside, my heart just grew to accommodate all this extra love I now have to give. I don\u2019t care if this is sappy or trite and I don\u2019t want to say that I love him more than anything ever because I love Timmy and my family. It\u2019s not about loving him more than something else I love. It\u2019s just awesome. I can\u2019t wait to watch him change and grow and take on my traits and Timmy\u2019s. I could go on forever, so I\u2019ll stop now, but get ready for a lot more Sonny talk coming soon.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/http://whitneyport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FullSizeRender-8.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/http://whitneyport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Whitney-Port-Pregnant-with-Hand-on-Belly-90x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/http://whitneyport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/featured-image-hospital-bag-625x480.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/http://whitneyport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/palmsbg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/http://whitneyport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_0950.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1027127517407895&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/http://whitneyport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/http://whitneyport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gugu-Concierge-90x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/http://whitneyport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FullSizeRender-8-90x70.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/http://whitneyport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Gugu-Concierge-625x480.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/http://whitneyport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Whitney-Port-Pregnant-with-Hand-on-Belly-625x480.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/http://whitneyport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/featured-image-hospital-bag-90x70.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808im_/http://whitneyport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FullSizeRender-8.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170801011808/http://whitneyport.com/2017/07/31/meet-our-son/", "title": "Whitney Port Announces Birth of First Child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "I am so happy to share the news that last Thursday, Tim and I welcomed our new son!
