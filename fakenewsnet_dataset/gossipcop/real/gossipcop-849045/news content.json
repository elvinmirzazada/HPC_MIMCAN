Massive musical numbers, topless Adam Devine, and the weirdest Stranger Things/Get Out crossover you could possibly imagine, it was Awards Show insanity at its finest.\n\nBut just because you got your fair dose of fun on-screen, doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t a load of loopiness happening off-screen. Luckily, we were on the ground to bring you all the backstage, behind-the-scenes gossip. Like these golden nuggets\u2026\n\nThe venue is haunted\n\nSpeak to any LA local and they\u2019ll happily tell of the city\u2019s many, many ghost stories. A lifetime of fame, fortune and famouses has led to all manner of tragedies, and so it\u2019s unsurprising to hear many of its buildings are supposedly haunted.\n\nA quick natter to any of the attendants working at The Shrine, this year\u2019s venue for the MTV Movie & TV Awards, and you\u2019d be regaled with all manner of ghostly stories. Ghosts of actors gone past wandering the halls, and eerie noises late at night, we were ready to channel our inner Ghostbuster HARD.\n\nAlas, we didn\u2019t see, hear or even smell a thing.\n\nWho knows? This time next year, we may see the paranormalecho of a topless Adam Devine running around the halls.\n\nTyler Posey would date Logan\n\nBefore the entire red carpet was shut down due to an impromptu hailstorm (more on that later), we played a fun/stupid/amazing Movie & TV Awards-inspired game of Would You Rather. It included such genius questions as \u2018Would You Rather Date Logan Or Beauty and the Beast\u2019s Beast?\u2019.\n\nTyler Posey is literally all of us.\n\nNoah Cyrus rehearsed in her lounge wear\n\nWe were privy to watch Noah Cyrus prep for her awesome performance of XXXX. As amazing as her voice was the fact she was bouncing around preparing in bright pink lounge wear.\n\nTurning up to work in our PJs (or close enough) is our literal spirit animal.\n\nAsia Kate Dillon is gallantry goals\n\nDuring the red carpet, the heavens opened up and hailstones rained down with aggressive abandon. We were chatting to Billions star Asia Kate Dillon at the time, who gracefully pulled our poncho over our heads as we struggled to survive the downpour.\n\nBeautiful, smart AND kind. MARRY US.\n\nSodden celebrity regroup\n\n10 minutes after the heavens opened and it was soon clear the weather wasn\u2019t going anywhere. As such, all the press and celebrities regrouped in the nearby cover of the venue\u2019s car park. It was a surreal, amazing sight to see a bunch of famouses (including Barb from Stranger Things, Alaska from RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, and Tyler Posey all soaked, huddling undercover.\n\nAmazing.", "images": ["https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:692bcfc3-9e71-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=webp&height=180&width=320&crop=true", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:692bcfc3-9e71-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true"], "top_img": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:692bcfc3-9e71-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.mtv.co.uk/news/pttcs2/5-things-you-wont-see-on-tv-2017-mtv-movie-tv-awards", "title": "5 Things You Won\u2019t See On TV: 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards", "meta_data": {"app_version": "dbbe19806-3279-2023-11-29", "robots": "noydir,noodp, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, maximum-scale=2", "theme-color": "#87b6c0", "msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Celebs in a hailstorm downpour, Asia Kate Dillon being THE BEST, and more...", "original-source": "https://www.mtv.co.uk/news/pttcs2/5-things-you-wont-see-on-tv-2017-mtv-movie-tv-awards", "search": {"title": "5 Things You Won\u2019t See On TV: 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards", "description": "Celebs in a hailstorm downpour, Asia Kate Dillon being THE BEST, and more...", "imageUrl": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:692bcfc3-9e71-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true", "imageHeight": 540, "imageWidth": 960, "url": "/news/pttcs2/5-things-you-wont-see-on-tv-2017-mtv-movie-tv-awards", "contentType": "Article", "bucketName": "Article", "labelName": "News", "contentDate": "2017-05-08T04:48:52.000Z"}, "og": {"site_name": "MTV", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:692bcfc3-9e71-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "title": "5 Things You Won\u2019t See On TV: 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards", "description": "Celebs in a hailstorm downpour, Asia Kate Dillon being THE BEST, and more...", "url": "https://www.mtv.co.uk/news/pttcs2/5-things-you-wont-see-on-tv-2017-mtv-movie-tv-awards", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Celebs in a hailstorm downpour, Asia Kate Dillon being THE BEST, and more...", "title": "5 Things You Won\u2019t See On TV: 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards", "image": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.co.uk:692bcfc3-9e71-11ed-84c2-164563049251?quality=0.7&gen=ntrn&legacyStatusCode=true&format=jpg&width=1200&height=630&crop=true"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.mtv.co.uk", "summary": ""}
