In the 1 minute teaser, she explains how difficult it is juggling her efforts on family life and music.\n\n\u201cMaking an album\u2026 it\u2019s so many moving pieces. It\u2019s a lot of pieces. The studio sessions, and you write the songs, and then you have to finish the songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s in New York and someone\u2019s in Philadelphia, and maybe there\u2019s a choir in Philadelphia. Then, it\u2019s photo shoots. Video shoots,\u201d she explained in the trailer.\n\nShe goes on to explain that there is so much more behind-the-scenes action that fans will be able to see in the documentary and how she manages her busy lifestyle. The film will be available to stream via Apple Music October 13th.\n\nI made a thing with @AppleMusic! It\u2019s a documentary about #BeautifulTrauma \u2013 Check out this trailer pic.twitter.com/NfQeRwG7Sa \u2014 P!nk (@Pink) October 5, 2017\n\nBut Pink isn\u2019t stopping there though as she has released another new song: \u201cWhatever You Want\u201d from Beautiful Trauma, which comes out October 13th as well. But the lyric video has been released and fans are already loving it.\n\nThe Grammy award winner has already teased fans with two tracks: \u201cWhatever You Want\u201d and \u201cBeautiful Trauma\u201d. Both singles sound so good and got us all excited for the new album.\n\nCongratulations to the singer for her new tour, single AND documentary.
