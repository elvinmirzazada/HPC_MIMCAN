To consider the wardrobe that Kim, Khlo\u00e9, Kendall, Kylie, Kourtney, and Kris have combined among them is downright mind-blowing. We can probably agree that we'd jump at an opportunity to raid any one of their walk-ins, which lucky for them is their sisterly birthright.\n\nThrough the years of KUTWK, we've watched them all swap, steal, share and squabble over clothes just like all female family members do. But what's it like to \"borrow\" from your mom and sister when everything they own is seriously expensive, if not one-of-a-kind? And when they have so many clothes and bags and shoes that they might not even notice something was missing if you snatched it? Is the Kardashian kloset-sharing experience anything like our own?\n\nIn a recent interview with People Style, Kendall Jenner dished on all the juicy details, including which sisters have the best selection of what pieces and who is the worst about sharing her clothes.\n\n\"Khlo\u00e9 has the best shoe selection and she's my size,\" the model revealed. \"Kourtney has good statement pieces. Kim has amazing things you could never find [elsewhere].\" Jenner also admitted to occasionally dipping into her mother Kris's collection of diamond jewelry.\n\n\"Everyone's very generous,\" she said.\n\nWell, almost everyone.\n\n\"We're all super-generous minus Kylie,\" Jenner clarified with a laugh. \"Kylie and I always fight over clothes. It's, like, a problem. But it's because we grew up together and we just grew up fighting over clothes.\"\n\nWho could forget their infamous throw-down before the ESPYs when Kendall boldly attempted to borrow one of Kylie's \"favorite brown dresses\"? (It's worth noting that we can't recall ever seeing Kylie wear a brown dress.)\n\nBut then it was Kylie who swiped Kris's vintage neon Body Glove swimsuit for a quick trip to Mexico. (Typical youngest child move.)\n\nSeems like the Kardashian women are pretty similar to the rest of us when it comes to the rules and emotions involved in opening your closet to others\u2014except it's Balmain they're borrowing/loaning and not a $10 tee from Forever 21.", "images": ["https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/search.f1c199c.svg",
