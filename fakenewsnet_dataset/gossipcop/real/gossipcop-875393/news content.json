Other video shows the president and the first lady wearing dark sunglasses walking out of what some say was Malia's dorm and getting into a SUV as a crowd of onlookers cheer.\n\nMalia Obama smiles as she boards Air Force One before departing from Andrews Air Force Base on April 7, 2016 in Maryland.

With so many people preoccupied with the solar eclipse and the official freshman move-in day taking place Tuesday, the Obamas\u2019 presence on campus drew less attention.\n\nIn a photo posted online by the Daily Mail, Malia is seen outside the dorm the next day wearing a black outfit and white sneakers holding a bottle of water while chatting with what appears to be a group of students.\n\nRelated: Malia Obama to Attend Harvard University\n\nJust like the Bush daughters attended the former colleges of their parents \u2014 Jenna, the University of Texas at Austin like their mother and Barbara, Yale University like their father \u2014 Malia is also keeping a college tradition in the family. Both Barack and Michelle Obama received their law degrees from Harvard. Caroline Kennedy, daughter of former president John F. Kennedy is also a graduate of Harvard.\n\nMalia had reportedly toured six out of eight Ivy Leagues and other schools, but her parents say they encouraged her to not choose a college because of the name.\n\n\u201cOne piece of advice that I\u2019ve given her is not to stress too much about having to get into one particular college,\u201d former president Obama said at a town hall in Des Moines, Iowa on college affordability in 2015.\n\nMalia Obama's hair flies into the air as a cold wind hits her and President Barack Obama while descending the steps of Air Force One upon their arrival at O'Hare Airport in Chicago on April 7, 2016.

Mrs. Obama has said Malia is interested in being a filmmaker. She interned with HBO\u2019s \u201cGirls\u201d and she also worked as a production assistant on Halle Berry\u2019s show, \u201cExtant.\u201d\n\nMalia was 10-years-old when she came into the national limelight after her father was elected the first Black president in 2008. After growing up in the White House, she is starting a new chapter as a young woman away from her parents and Washington.\n\nRelated: Barack Obama and Joe Biden Save the Future in \u2018Barry & Joe: The Animated Series\u2019\n\nFormer president Obama is known to get emotional when talking about his daughters growing up. In an interview with Ellen DeGeneres in 2016, Obama joked he would be wearing \u201cdark glasses, sobbing\u201d at Malia\u2019s graduation. He declined an invitation to speak at Malia\u2019s graduation in 2016, because he said he would be emotional.\n\nThe first day of fall classes at Harvard is August 30, 2017.\n\nFollow NBCBLK on Facebook, Twitter & Instagram", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170824104832im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_34/2130891/170823-malia-obama-ac-813p_99f708cb9b86046d8df612b849bf5b10.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170824104832im_/https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/today-logo-site-nav.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170824104832im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_14/1488661/ss-160407-tip-02_93d6a5475eba0f4e1620fbfa6a88b99f.nbcnews-ux-600-480.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170824104832im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_14/1488661/ss-160407-tip-02_93d6a5475eba0f4e1620fbfa6a88b99f.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170824104832im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_34/2130891/170823-malia-obama-ac-813p_99f708cb9b86046d8df612b849bf5b10.nbcnews-fp-360-360.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170824104832im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_34/2130891/170823-malia-obama-ac-813p_99f708cb9b86046d8df612b849bf5b10.nbcnews-ux-600-700.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170824104832im_/https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/images/transparent-placeholder.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170824104832im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_34/2130891/170823-malia-obama-ac-813p_99f708cb9b86046d8df612b849bf5b10.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chandelis R.
