And turns out, she also slyly debuted her husband Kanye West\u2018s long-awaited Yeezy Season 6 collection.\n\nThe Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star, 37, revealed she wore a total of nine Yeezy outfits on Tuesday. \u201cMy schedule was so busy, I ended up in nine different Yeezy outfits in one day,\u201d Kardashian explained on her website and app.\n\n\u201cFor each look, I wanted to stick with neutral vibes,\u201d she added.\n\nLest you think Kim tired herself out styling all those looks, don\u2019t worry: She had an assist from CR Fashion Book editor Carine Roitfeld, long a friend of the family\u2019s. Kardashian thanked the editor on Twitter after tweeting out photos from her fashion parade, and added, \u201cAnd I love [my hometown of] Calabasas for being my runway!\u201d\n\nSplash\n\nSplash News\n\nLooking for more style content?

He\u2019s a notorious workaholic, so balancing both that work \u2013 which is extremely important to him \u2013 and the rigors of the tour every night, it really wore him out.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Kardashian and West will be looking forward to welcoming their third child together via surrogate next year.", "images":
