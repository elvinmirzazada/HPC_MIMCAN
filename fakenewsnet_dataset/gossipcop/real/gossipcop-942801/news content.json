People was first to report the news.\n\nAlliegro revealed that she was pregnant in an interview with Daily Mail in September of last year, but at the time said she didn\u2019t want O'Donnell to be a part of her baby's life. The expecting mother, who was reported missing by O'Donnell in 2015 (she was later found at the house of another man), said she and O'Donnell didn't \"have a relationship anymore\" and she didn't think \"it [could] be mended.\"\n\n\"I've always wanted a family and I'm looking forward to it. But Rosie will not be in my child's life -- and no, I do not feel sad about that to be honest,\" Alliegro said. Both O'Donnell and her daughter have been vocal about their tumultuous relationship.\n\nFollowing Alliegro's comments, O'Donnell responded by taking to Twitter and writing, \"She's 20...not a teen...she is married and pregnant...she doesn't want anything to do with me...great stop...doing interviews go live ur life. We have been here before Chelsea...u wanna go a few rounds in public...seems so...Michelle's death = money 4 Chelsea.\"\n\nIn another interview with Inside Edition last year, Alliegro recalled how the last time she and O'Donnell got in an argument, \"We ended up screaming at each other and I left the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I never really got along with her and then once she kicked me out, I was just kind of done,\u201d she added.\n\nSee more on their complicated relationship in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2Fgettyimages-687477320.jpg%3Fh%3D6b7011a3&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-06%2F1280_rosie_odonnell_chelsea_541900858_062116.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-06%2Frosie_o_donnell_gettyimages-950606828.jpg%3Fh%3D93e29675&w=1024&q=100", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-06/gettyimages-988303756.jpg?h=25a2d821&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/rosie_o_donnell_gettyimages-950606828.jpg?h=93e29675"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/rosie_o_donnell_gettyimages-950606828.jpg?h=93e29675", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/rosie-odonnell-says-shes-reconnected-with-pregnant-daughter-chelsea-103891", "title": "Rosie O'Donnell Says She's 'Reconnected' With Pregnant Daughter Chelsea", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/rosie_o_donnell_gettyimages-950606828.jpg?h=93e29675", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 56-year-old talk show host confirmed that her 20-year-old daughter is expecting a baby.", "title": "Rosie O'Donnell Says She's 'Reconnected' With Pregnant Daughter Chelsea", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rosie-odonnell-says-shes-reconnected-with-pregnant-daughter-chelsea-103891", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 56-year-old talk show host confirmed that her 20-year-old daughter is expecting a baby.", "twitter": {"description": "The 56-year-old talk show host confirmed that her 20-year-old daughter is expecting a baby.", "title": "Rosie O'Donnell Says She's 'Reconnected' With Pregnant Daughter Chelsea", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rosie-odonnell-says-shes-reconnected-with-pregnant-daughter-chelsea-103891", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/rosie_o_donnell_gettyimages-950606828.jpg?h=93e29675", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Rosie O'Donnell Says She's 'Reconnected' With Pregnant Daughter Chelsea  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Rosie O Donnell", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
