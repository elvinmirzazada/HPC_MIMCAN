Though they don\u2019t mind making the occasional appearance on each other\u2019s social media accounts, they have avoided publicly wearing wedding rings -- or the accessories went unnoticed.\n\nTurns out, Sparks met her husband\u2019s family before she met him! The singer was introduced to them at an event in February and was made aware that the aspiring model wanted to move out to California. That's when Sparks\u2019 mother and Isaiah\u2019s mom put the two into a group text chat.\n\n\u201cMy mom was trying to get [Jordin] to talk me out of moving to L.A. because she\u2019s experienced the industry out here,\u201d Isaiah explained. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, \u2018We want you guys to date.'\u201d\n\nThings, however, started to move quickly after the pair met in person.\n\n\u201cA couple days after we had actually met, I was like in my head \u2018That\u2019s going to be my husband! That\u2019s my husband right there,'\u201d Sparks said, noting she discussed not moving in until they made things official. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with him, I feel comfort and safety and calm and peace, and those aren\u2019t things that I normally felt. So it was a little wake-up call for me.\u201d\n\nThe spouses eloped in Hawaii with a small group of friends, and were shocked to learn just a month later that Sparks was pregnant.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really crazy because everything changes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cOnce we got over the initial shock of it, now again just like it is with the marriage, to be able to share that this amazing thing is happening, it\u2019s such a great thing. We did this together!\u201d\n\nFor more from Sparks, watch the clip below!", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2Fjordin_sparks_853841174.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/jordin_sparks_dana_83061866.jpg?h=692786f3", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2Fjason_momoa_lisa_bonet_gettyimages-494393752.jpg%3Fh%3D4fb58977&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2022-03/Billie_Lourd_GettyImages-1057181318_1920.jpg?h=b8626526&width=640"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/jordin_sparks_dana_83061866.jpg?h=692786f3", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jordin-sparks-secretly-marries-dana-isaiah-announces-shes-pregnant-first-child-91022", "title": "Jordin Sparks Secretly Marries Dana Isaiah, Announces She's Pregnant With First Child!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/jordin_sparks_dana_83061866.jpg?h=692786f3", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The couple reportedly eloped in Hawaii over the summer.", "title": "Jordin Sparks Secretly Marries Dana Isaiah, Announces She's Pregnant With First Child!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jordin-sparks-secretly-marries-dana-isaiah-announces-shes-pregnant-first-child-91022", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The couple reportedly eloped in Hawaii over the summer.", "twitter": {"description": "The couple reportedly eloped in Hawaii over the summer.", "title": "Jordin Sparks Secretly Marries Dana Isaiah, Announces She's Pregnant With First Child!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jordin-sparks-secretly-marries-dana-isaiah-announces-shes-pregnant-first-child-91022", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/jordin_sparks_dana_83061866.jpg?h=692786f3", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Jordin Sparks Secretly Marries Dana Isaiah, Announces She's Pregnant With First Child! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Jordin Sparks", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 42, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
