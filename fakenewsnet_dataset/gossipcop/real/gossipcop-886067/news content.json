That's when I felt like, 'OK, I gotta get my life together. What am I gonna do?' I pushed that on myself at a younger age than the average kid because at the time my family had lost our home. I've always been more mature for my age, so I was already understanding what they were going through. And I just thought, 'How can I help them?'[16]\n\nShe initially attended public school, though had to undergo home schooling due to issues with bullying.[16] She claimed that at one point she was jumped by multiple girls while in the restroom, and was a frequent target due to her jobs in the entertainment industry.[17]\n\nGomez appeared in the short film El Tux (2008) as Claudia G\u00f3mez and as Nina in the Discovery Channel television film La estaci\u00f3n de la Calle Olvera (2008).[18][19] She became a member of a girl group named G.L.A.M. in 2009,[20] and later joined B.C.G., a duo with G.L.A.M. member Cristal G.[21] She filmed a music video as part of G.L.A.M. for a song titled \"JellyBean\" in 2009.

I was 100 percent in. She has so much personality and her voice just pops out of the speakers. Then I met her and discovered she could also sing and play the guitar and I thought, 'This is even better.' Then I found out she could write and it was like, 'What else are you going to tell me, that you're also Van Gogh?' Her potential is limitless.\"[17] Shortly after signing with the label, Gomez began work on her debut album.[1]\n\n2012\u20132015: Commercial success with music and acting [ edit ]\n\nGomez performing in 2013.\n\nIn August, while working on her debut album, Gomez released her first song, \"Problem\", featuring will.i.am, which was subsequently remixed into \"Problem (The Monster Remix)\" in September, for the Sony Pictures Animation film Hotel Transylvania; the song served as a promotional single and also appeared in the movie's end credits.[22] Gomez and will.i.am filmed a music video for the song; it features Gomez wandering around a hotel with wil.i.am walking out of the walls while scenes from the movie also appear.[1] She was featured on Australian singer Cody Simpson's song \"Wish U Were Here\", serviced as the second single from his debut studio album on August 7.[23] She worked with British singer Cher Lloyd on the song \"Oath\", originally written by Gomez, released on October 2 as the fourth single from her debut album.[24] The single had some commercial success, becoming Gomez's first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[25] The track was later certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting sales of 500,000 copies in the country.[26] She also worked with Brazilian singer Michel Tel\u00f3 on a remix of his cover of the song \"Ai Se Eu Te Pego\", released on his UK EP on October 14.
