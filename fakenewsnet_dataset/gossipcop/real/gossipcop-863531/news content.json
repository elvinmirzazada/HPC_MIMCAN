But something went awry, as Jones took to her Twitter yesterday to express her anger.\n\n\u201cWow was such a great night at the BET awards,\u201d she posted. \u201cBut then had THE WORST STAY @RitzCarlton DO NOT STAY THERE!! THEY DONT LIKE BLACK PEOPLE!!\u201d\n\nThe Ritz-Carlton\u2019s official Twitter account expressed their dismay at Jones\u2019 tweet, replying with the following response:\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that the Ritz-Carlton has been accused of discrimination. In 2015, the North Carolina Attorney General\u2019s office investigated the luxury hotel chain\u2019s Charlotte location for potentially discriminating against Black people by adding a 15 percent surcharge to customers bills during a CIAA conference.\n\nThis also isn\u2019t the first time the Saturday Night Live star has publicly expressed her concerns. Last summer, Jones also took to Twitter to express that no designer would dress her for the premiere of Ghostbusters, which the comedian starred in.", "images": ["https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1498251449/GettyImages-699506884.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1498251449/GettyImages-699506884.jpg?width=1280", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/rgb-TAG-Registered-80px.png", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/themes/essence/assets/images/footer-bg-202209.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1498251449/GettyImages-699506884.jpg?width=1280", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.essence.com/celebrity/leslie-jones-ritz-carlton-they-dont-black-people/", "title": "Leslie Jones Slams The Ritz-Carlton, Claims 'They Don\u2019t Like Black People'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, shrink-to-fit=no", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"image": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1498251449/GettyImages-699506884.jpg?width=1280", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Leslie Jones Slams The Ritz-Carlton, Claims 'They Don\u2019t Like Black People'\r\n | Essence", "description": "Leslie Jones Slams The Ritz-Carlton, Claims 'They Don\u2019t Like Black People'", "url": "https://www.essence.com/celebrity/leslie-jones-ritz-carlton-they-dont-black-people/", "site_name": "Essence"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1498251449/GettyImages-699506884.jpg?width=1280", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Leslie Jones Slams The Ritz-Carlton, Claims 'They Don\u2019t Like Black People'\r\n | Essence", "site": "@essence", "label1": "Est. reading time", "data1": "1 minute"}, "description": "The Saturday Night Live comedian accused\u00a0the luxury hotel chain of racism and discrimination.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/essence", "modified_time": "2020-10-26T17:54:58+00:00", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "fb": {"pages": 68771922854}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cropped-ESSENCE-ICON_512-2a-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.essence.com", "summary": ""}
