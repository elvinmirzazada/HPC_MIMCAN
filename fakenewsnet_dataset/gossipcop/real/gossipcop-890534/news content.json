She famously left home at 18 to make it as a dancer, and burst on the scene in 1991 as one of the Fly Girls on Fox\u2019s In Living Color, the hit comedy series. She quickly parlayed her luminous beauty, talent, and sheer workaholism into a series of starring roles, including Marisa in Maid in Manhattan, which grossed more than $150 million worldwide.\n\nOf their first date Lopez recalls, \u201cI don\u2019t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. . . . He was nervous, and it was really cute.\u201d\n\nBeing a movie star wasn\u2019t enough for Lopez. She also released a string of hit albums and became a fashion icon. In 2003, she signed a lucrative endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton. \u201cNow it\u2019s odd if you\u2019re a celebrity and you don\u2019t serve as the spokesperson for a brand,\u201d says Benny Medina, her longtime manager, whom Lopez credits with seeing the potential of celebrities as brands long before it was commonplace. \u201cBut back then there were plenty of snarky comments.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Lopez was granted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the following year she became the first female artist to receive a Billboard Icon Award; her net worth has been estimated at more than $300 million. \u201cThere are people who put their feet in other people\u2019s footsteps,\u201d says Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, who was once Lopez\u2019s agent and is now a partner in her production company. \u201cJennifer had no footsteps in front of her, so much of the terrain had to be forged.\u201d\n\nThere was a cost, Lopez learned. \u201cWhen you have that type of success at a young age you have to navigate it, almost survive it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the first Latin actress to ever make $1 million from a role, and you feel, Oh God, I have to do something great all the time.\u201d There were the inevitable flops (most prominently Gigli, her movie with then boyfriend Ben Affleck) and three failed marriages, the last of which was with Marc Anthony, the father of her twins.\n\nAnd so her story isn\u2019t just about astounding achievement but also about personal growth and resilience. \u201cI was eviscerated,\u201d she recalls about the press on Gigli. \u201cI lost my sense of self, questioned if I belonged in this business, thought maybe I did suck at everything. And my relationship [with Affleck] self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.\u201d\n\nShe has also conquered what was once her biggest fear: being alone. Last August, she broke up with dancer Casper Smart in an effort to learn how. \u201cShe\u2019s a seeker,\u201d says her close friend Leah Remini, the actress and anti-Scientology activist. \u201cShe\u2019s always trying to improve herself, her relationships, be a better friend, a better daughter, a better mother, a better person. She\u2019s not closed-minded.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654a761b69c700a1da9899f3/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655e1c34dfbc7ec08fbe1406/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f36396ddf784604d17e8eb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss06.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e545ba52f252468160b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639525b7a40d71fd1638/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655bd5f51fdc217b5d22c9a6/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e5225b7a40d71fd1688/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f363955ba52f25246815cd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639540dfcc68ac21c0d3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5847108b9dee4a361369e3fe/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639540dfcc68ac21c0d4/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639616ff751cf425ef2c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss05.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655e54b5bdc5e91f203294b4/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e545ba52f252468160b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Bethany Mclean", "Mario Testino", "Jessica Diehl"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-cover-story", "title": "J-Rod!
