Bunheads will be available on December 14, Agent Carter is available now, and Cougar Town will be available next year.\n\nThe other new shows are Revenge (which will exclusive to Hulu after a lengthy stint on Netflix), Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers\u2019 The Catch, Freeform\u2019s Shadowhunters, \u201890s sitcom Blossom, and the Eric McCormack-starring Perception. Other than Revenge, which is coming on December 7, all of those shows are either available now or will be available next year. The other big get for Hulu is Designated Survivor, which is now exclusively available on Hulu.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.avclub.com/bunheads-agent-carter-and-cougar-town-are-heading-to-1820863368", "title": "Bunheads, Agent Carter, and Cougar Town are heading to Hulu", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "QDPLbDJXTQNT0n69mvNADCeRmwnbkYyL20OKJAVCKq8", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW", "description": "Hulu\u2019s gradual takeover of the streaming world continues, with Disney and ABC granting it the rights to a good selection of new-ish and classic-ish shows.
