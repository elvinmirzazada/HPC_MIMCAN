That\u2019s right, the sequel is almost upon us, which means it\u2019s time to watch even more hilarious Deadpool shenanigans. After teaming up with Celine Dion for an amazingly hilarious music video, Deadpool now hired David Beckham to promote the upcoming Deadpool 2 movie. Also, to apologize.\n\nIn the first Deadpool movie, Deadpool insults the former soccer player in one of the film\u2019s hilarious scenes. \u201cYou ever heard David Beckham speak?\u201d Deadpool says. \u201cIt\u2019s like he mouth-sexed a can of helium.\u201d\n\nBeckham is watching that particular scene in the new clip when a deluge of Deadpool apologies assault him. First it\u2019s text messages, and when those don\u2019t work, Deadpool himself comes to Beckham\u2019s home.\n\nWhen all else fails, Ryan Reynolds, in full Deadpool gear and with a soccer t-shirt on top, offers Beckham tickets to the upcoming World Cup. The fact that he\u2019s wearing what appears to be a Canadian soccer team shirt with the name Deadpool and number 2 on it is just glorious.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to not watch Italy play the Netherlands,\u201d he tells the soccer star, mentioning two countries that recently failed to qualify for this summer\u2019s tournament.\n\nBeckham accepts the apology with a huge twist. In his opinion, Reynolds should really apologize for a slew of movies he made before Deadpool. The whole thing is hilarious, and you can watch it in full below:\n\nThe movie launches next Friday in cinemas around the world.", "images": ["https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DC-Studios-Logo.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=360&h=203&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/themes/bgr-2023/assets/images/pmc-logos/the-hollywood-reporter-white-hr.svg", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/deadpool-david-beckham-promo.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=950&h=390&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/chris-smith-avatar.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=50", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/themes/bgr-2023/assets/images/pmc-logos/variety-white-hr.svg", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/deadpool-david-beckham-promo.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/themes/bgr-2023/assets/images/jonathan-geller-bgr-show-footer.jpg", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/themes/bgr-2023/assets/images/pmc-logos/billboard-white-hr.svg", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/themes/bgr-2023/assets/images/pmc-logos/pmc-white.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/1013bc3efebd417594984a1c0f0298eb/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/themes/bgr-2023/assets/images/pmc-logos/deadline-white-hr.svg", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/apple-wwdc-2023-ios-17-reality-111.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=360&h=203&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AdobeStock_194080021.jpeg?quality=82&strip=all&w=360&h=203&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rsz_griselda_s1_e1_native_00_28_21_11r.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=360&h=203&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GTA-5.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=360&h=203&crop=1", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-203220h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/rsz_extraction_2_upscaled_01_15_23_10_r.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=360&h=203&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/themes/bgr-2023/assets/images/pmc-logos/rolling-stone-white-hr.svg", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/apple-card-bgr.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=360&h=203&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AdobeStock_284114653.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=360&h=203&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/chris-smith-avatar.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=56", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/themes/bgr-2023/assets/images/pmc-logos/robb-report-white-hr.svg"], "top_img": "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/deadpool-david-beckham-promo.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Smith", "Jacob Siegal", "Andy Meek", "Jos\u00e9 Adorno", "Joshua Hawkins"], "canonical_link": "https://bgr.com/entertainment/deadpool-2-david-beckham-promo-viral/", "title": "Deadpool apologizing to David Beckham is the best thing you\u2019ll see all day", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "kctgBmR1DISoVtm-j4irQggAvxPPJ7Xqsxbd5Jj3ELc", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Deadpool apologizing to David Beckham is the best thing you\u2019ll see all day", "description": "We\u2019re in the final stretch, Deadpool fans.
