The Australian actress and her husband, Bobby Cannavale, are expecting their second child. Byrne shared the happy news yesterday on Australian website DavidJones.com saying, \"I\u2019m a little tired but feeling good. Everyone was very sweet on set today, and you always get a little bit more attention when you\u2019re pregnant, which is fabulous.\"\n\nThe set Byrne was referring to is the upcoming project Juliet, Naked, a dramedy based on the book by Nick Hornby. As fans of the actress know, this isn't exactly her first foray into humor; Byrne memorably stared in Bridesmaids and Neighbors. She also appeared in the X-Men franchise films, and held a key role in HBO's adaptation of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks alongside Oprah Winfrey.\n\nByrne and Cannavale are already parents to son, Rocco, who was born in February 2016. And while we'll just have to wait to hear whether Rocco will be getting a baby brother or sister, there's no doubt that with a toddler already in the house, the expectant mother will indeed need a little extra attention.", "images": ["https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/account-avatar.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/64fcfb7bbc014127dcb11a79/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6557a0d4d7e38056bd5e8d08/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/655ab8d339413b7262240ce1/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/599b0450f0b0e21484d34492/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/00-lede-rose-byrne-and-bobby-cannavale-are-expecting-baby-number-two.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/589146377edfa70512d634bd/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/64419061a22b7272aab1fc8e/master/h_120%2Cc_limit/WEDDING-LINK-BANNER.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/599b045cb08d341ce626c6b5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-tout-rose-byrne-and-bobby-cannavale-are-expecting-baby-number-two.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/655e849c440a42ae58908b2d/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo-header.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/618a7732d1ad0068cc0d3d0a/4:3/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/599b045cb08d341ce626c6b5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-tout-rose-byrne-and-bobby-cannavale-are-expecting-baby-number-two.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/rose-byrne-pregnant-second-baby-bobby-cannavale", "title": "Rose Byrne Is Pregnant With Her Second Child", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Actress Rose Byrne and husband, Bobby Cannavale, who are already parents to son, Rocco, are expecting their second child.", "id": "599b031b517ced1a8fc5fd25", "keywords": "announcements", "news_keywords": "announcements", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "599b031b517ced1a8fc5fd25", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Actress Rose Byrne and husband, Bobby Cannavale, who are already parents to son, Rocco, are expecting their second child.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/599b0440068a3216afff9ef1/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-tout-rose-byrne-and-bobby-cannavale-are-expecting-baby-number-two.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/599b0440068a3216afff9ef1/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-tout-rose-byrne-and-bobby-cannavale-are-expecting-baby-number-two.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Actress Rose Byrne and husband, Bobby Cannavale, who are already parents to son, Rocco, are expecting their second child.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/599b045cb08d341ce626c6b5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-tout-rose-byrne-and-bobby-cannavale-are-expecting-baby-number-two.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Rose Byrne Is Pregnant With Her Second Child", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/rose-byrne-pregnant-second-baby-bobby-cannavale"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-08-21T16:25:58.545Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-21T16:25:58.545Z", "author": "Vogue"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "Actress Rose Byrne and husband, Bobby Cannavale, who are already parents to son, Rocco, are expecting their second child.", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/599b045cb08d341ce626c6b5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-tout-rose-byrne-and-bobby-cannavale-are-expecting-baby-number-two.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Rose Byrne Is Pregnant With Her Second Child"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/599b045cb08d341ce626c6b5/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/00-social-tout-rose-byrne-and-bobby-cannavale-are-expecting-baby-number-two.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503332758.545, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
