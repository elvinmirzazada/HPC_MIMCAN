Ayr\u2019s backstory for the shirt is that it \u201cwas a banker on Wall Street until she cashed out and started a new career as a florist on Nantucket.\u201d I thought that was the right description once I tried it myself after requesting it from the brand \u2014 it has a look that falls somewhere between vintage Ralph Lauren and Ina Garten\u2019s Hamptons uniform.\n\nThe Oxford cotton that the button-down is made of \u2014 which the company says is milled in Italy \u2014 has a pleasing weightiness without feeling too heavy. Iva Pawling, founder of Richer Poorer, explains that its appearance of a classic starched shirt betrays how soft it really is. It\u2019s nicely opaque and not sheer; at most you might see, say, a lacy black bra peeking through. That keeps it from feeling too buttoned-up. \u201cI feel put together but not trying too hard, polished but not preppy,\u201d Pawling says.\n\nThe shirt also features a boxy but not-too-big silhouette. Kate Sokolov, co-founder of Social Goods, previously praised it for being big-bust-friendly. Unlike other button-downs that sometimes don\u2019t close all the way, Sokolov uttered an immediate \u201cOh, this is great!\u201d once she tried hers on. I sized down per her suggestion (I usually have to size up for button-downs) to get a more tailored classic cut. But if you\u2019re looking for a looser fit, go with the size you usually take.", "images": ["https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/product/strategist-tested.svg",
