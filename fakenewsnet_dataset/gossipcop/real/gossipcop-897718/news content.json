The new mom showed off her post-pregnancy weight in a mirror selfie on Wednesday, while also detailing how she kept her pregnancy \u201cdrama free.\u201d\n\n\u201c1 week postpartum \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd,\u201d she wrote in the caption. \u201cI gained a total of 22 lbs during my entire pregnancy. With the help from nursing along with training, & eating well during my pregnancy i must say it was all belly weight. \ud83d\ude1c\u201d\n\n\u201cI remained stress/drama free & kept positive energy around me on a regular basis..for the sake of my health & Zo\u2019s,\u201d she continued. \u201cI say this to say I\u2019m super proud of the progress that I\u2019m making to get back on my feet taking it one day at a time..baby is good, life is good! \ud83d\ude0a#WCW #TheNaturalWay.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kevin Hart and Eniko Parrish Share First Photo of Son Kenzo\n\nWhile Parrish said her pregnancy was stress-free, her family did face turmoil before their newest member arrived.\n\nBefore their son was born, Hart, 38, apologized to his wife and family on Instagram after he became the target of an alleged extortion attempt that included a \u201csexually provocative\u201d video of the comedian and another woman.\n\nA source told PEOPLE at the time that Parrish \u201cis fully cooperating with the law enforcement investigation\u201d in regard to her husband\u2019s alleged extortion scandal.\n\nDespite seeking peace for her pregnancy, the cheating allegations took a toll on her, a second source told PEOPLE previously.\n\n\u201cShe has been hounded by the press, and is very upset,\u201d the source said.\n\nKenzo is the couple\u2019s first child together. Hart is also a father to son Hendrix, 10, and daughter, Heaven, 12, whom he shares with ex-wife Torrei Hart.", "images":
