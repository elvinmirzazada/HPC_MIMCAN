He shows up later in the episode in his adult version (Andrew J. West) on a motorcycle, where he collides with Cinderella (Dania Ramirez).\n\nKitsis pointed out that the show would introduce a new version of Alice in Wonderland, who will be different from the one that fans met in the short-lived spinoff \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Wonderland.\u201d\n\nColin O\u2019Donoghue (Hook) said that the new season has a very different feel on set for the cast.\n\n\u201cIt almost feels like we\u2019re all starting the show afresh together,\u201d the actor said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like we\u2019re starting over.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d returns to ABC on Friday, Oct. 6.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Barbie-Split.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/San-Diego-Comic-Con-2023-Saturday-and-Sunday.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Once-Upon-a-Time.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Comic-Con-2023-Party-Report.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Once-Upon-a-Time.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SDCC-Cosplay-El-Chapulin-Colorado.png?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Once-Upon-a-Time.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Gajewski", "Andi Ortiz", "Ross A.
