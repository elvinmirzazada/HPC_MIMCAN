Olivia Newton-John is on her road to recovery after fighting breast cancer for the second time. The actress spoke to the Today show in Melbourne, Australia in an interview shared on Thursday, September 21 \u2014 and said being diagnosed with the disease has taught her just how strong she really is.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Health Scares Trista Sutter, Selena Gomez, Ellen DeGeneres and more stars have opened up about their unexpected illnesses and injuries \u2014 read more\n\nAfter 25 years in remission, Newton-John\u2019s cancer came back four months ago, causing her to postpone her tour. \u201cI thought I had sciatica. It was painful to walk,\u201d the singer revealed. \u201cI thought it was that. I was still performing. I would kind of grit my teeth, take a couple aspirin and go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving it happen again, I thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019ve done it before, I got through this before and I can do it again,\u2019\u201d the \u201cI Honestly Love You\u201d songstress said. \u201cOf course, you have fear. That\u2019s only natural. But my positive outlook is a decision. I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say I have dark moments and negative moments, I\u2019m human. But on a general scale, I tend to see the glass is half full.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cPhysical\u201d singer doesn\u2019t read into prognosis and statistics because it can be really \u201cdepressing,\u201d saying: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be one of those statistics, I\u2019m going to be fine. I\u2019ll probably deal with this in my life as an ongoing thing. I think that you can live with cancer like you can live with other things if you take care of yourself.\u201d\n\nRelated: Compare the 1978 'Grease' Cast to the 2016 Stars of 'Grease: Live' Compare the 1978 cast of 'Grease' (Olivia Newton-John, John Travolta and Stockard Channing) to the new stars of 'Grease Live' (Julianne Hough, Aaron Tveit and Vanessa Hudgens) in these side-by-side photos!\n\nThe Grammy winner has learned to combine chemotherapy with other types of treatments such as natural supplements, massages, yoga and music therapy. After dealing with it the first time around, the star opened the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Center where she helps other patients and their families with their recovery. She said, \u201cWithout that experience, I wouldn\u2019t have grown and had the desire or the passion to help other people who are going through it and the compassion to understand what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re going through cancer.\u201d\n\nThe actress, 68, credits her recovery with the love and support from her daughter, Chloe Rose Lattanzi, and husband, John Easterling, but also in part due to medical marijuana. \u201cPeople have this vision from the \u201960s of people just sitting around and getting stoned. It\u2019s not about that,\u201d she said. \u201cThis plant is a healing plant. I think we need to change the vision of what it is because it helped me greatly and it helps with pain and inflammation.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars \u2014 They're Just Like Us! They may live in the spotlight, but these stars have no problem doing every day tasks\n\nDespite her cancer diagnosis, Newton-John has maintained a positive attitude: \u201cI think it taught me that I was stronger than I thought I was. Because even though you have a team around you and people helping you, really, in the end, it\u2019s up to you. Believe you can do it and go through it. It made me stronger.\u201d\n\nThank You!
