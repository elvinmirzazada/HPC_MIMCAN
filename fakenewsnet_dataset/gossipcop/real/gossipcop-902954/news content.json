They were very low-key and dressed casually,\" the source continued. \"They rang in the New Year together and enjoyed watching fireworks over the ocean.\"\n\nPer a second source, \"Justin had a great New Year's Eve with Selena. He is looking forward to 2018 with her. It was a special evening shared with a few close friends in a beautiful place.\"", "images":
