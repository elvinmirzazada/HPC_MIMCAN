DeMille award, the 68-year-old actress praises her \"barn burner\" speech. As for whether Streep would endorse Winfrey for president, she responds, \"Where do I send the check?\"\n\nThe nine-time Golden Globe winner didn't stop there! Further gushing over Winfrey's speech, she adds, \"You realize how we thirst for that. We really want that kind of elevated, aspirational, can-do, optimistic attachment to the principles of our country.\"\n\nAlso during the show, Streep accepts a challenge to embody some of Hanks' most iconic movie roles. He did the same, and hilariously donned a Julia Child wig in an attempt to impersonate the actress' portrayal of the cook in Julia & Julia.\n\nIn addition to Streep backing her, Winfrey was also endorsed by another Golden Globe winner. Lady Bird star Saoirse Ronan told ET's Nancy O'Dell that she thinks the Queen of Talk is a \"perfect\" presidential candidate.\n\n\"Oprah for president!\" she exclaimed. \"Seriously, I think she'd be amazing.\"\n\nRonan added, \"I mean, we know she's incredible. I loved the speech.\"\n\nCheck out more of ET's exclusive interview with the 23-year-old actress:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/hanks_streep_901540740.jpg?h=6bd92f54", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fhanks_streep_901540740.jpg%3Fh%3D6bd92f54&w=1024&q=100", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fet_gg_biglittlelies_intv_010718.jpg%3Fh%3Dd1cb525d&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-01/timesup_getty902403226.jpg?h=fc268305&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Foprah_vidpic_010818_1280.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2F1280_oprah_winfrey_gettyimages-902753374_0.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/hanks_streep_901540740.jpg?h=6bd92f54", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/tom-hanks-has-meryl-streeps-vote-run-vice-president-oprah-winfrey-93913", "title": "Tom Hanks Has Meryl Streep's Vote to Run for Vice President With Oprah Winfrey", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/hanks_streep_901540740.jpg?h=6bd92f54", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 'Post' stars appeared on Tuesday's episode of 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show.'", "title": "Tom Hanks Has Meryl Streep's Vote to Run for Vice President With Oprah Winfrey", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tom-hanks-has-meryl-streeps-vote-run-vice-president-oprah-winfrey-93913", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 'Post' stars appeared on Tuesday's episode of 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show.'", "twitter": {"description": "The 'Post' stars appeared on Tuesday's episode of 'The Ellen DeGeneres Show.'", "title": "Tom Hanks Has Meryl Streep's Vote to Run for Vice President With Oprah Winfrey", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tom-hanks-has-meryl-streeps-vote-run-vice-president-oprah-winfrey-93913", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/hanks_streep_901540740.jpg?h=6bd92f54", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Tom Hanks Has Meryl Streep's Vote to Run for Vice President With Oprah Winfrey | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Ellen Degeneres, The Ellen Degeneres Show, Oprah Winfrey", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
