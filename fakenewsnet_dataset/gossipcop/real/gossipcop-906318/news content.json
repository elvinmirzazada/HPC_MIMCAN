Brown/Getty Images\n\n\"TCA today for @stepupseries! Im all about this look,\" she later posted on Instagram.\n\nRivera re-filed for divorce from Ryan Dorsey in December after filing to dismiss the order in October. Things got heated between Rivera -- who originally filed for divorce in November 2016 -- and Dorsey in November before she was arrested in Kanawha County, West Virginia, for domestic battery against the actor.\n\nDorsey later spoke out about Rivera's arrest, asking that their family's privacy be respected during this \"difficult time.\" Court documents obtained by ET in December show that the pair reached a custody agreement over their 2-year-old son, Josey, agreeing to share 50/50 joint custody.
