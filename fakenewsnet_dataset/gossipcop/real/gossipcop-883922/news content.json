A growing roster of celebrities are stepping up to humiliate themselves for a good cause: John Oliver, Judd Apatow and Sarah Silverman are just a few famous faces sharing their awkward years as part of the #PuberMe challenge, launched when Nick Kroll and Stephen Colbert shared photos from their teen years.\n\nColbert\u2019s AmeriCone Dream Fund has offered to donate $1000 for every awkward picture tweeted and/or Instagrammed by a celebrity with the #PuberMe and #PuertoRicoRelief hashtags. The money will go to One America Appeal, an organization started by five living former American Presidents to encourage their fellow citizens to support recovery efforts from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\n\nIn a time when people in power, particularly in the U.S. should be reaching out and helping Puerto Rico and the Caribbean in the wake of devastation left by Hurricane Irma and Maria instead of tweeting negativity, many are stepping up and doing what they can for relief \u2014 including celebrities. Many are using their platform to send money and aid. Jennifer Lopez donated $1 million and continues to support while Beyonce lent her voice to a remix of J Balvin and Willy William\u2019s \u201cMi Gente\u201d with the proceeds from the song going to hurricane relief efforts.\n\nThe #PuberMe campaign is a positive and lighthearted way to bring awareness and aid to Puerto Rico and everyone affected by the recent hurricanes.\n\nAfter Colbert and Kroll shared their pics, others started rolling in. This included enjoyable snapshots of Kroll\u2019s Oh Hello and Big Mouth co-star John Mulaney and Sarah Silverman. Judd Apatow\u2019s is reminiscent of Freaks and Geeks while Steve Martin\u2019s is very\u2026beardy.\n\nNick Kroll asked me to post a pic of my awkward stage, but I never had one. So here's me lookin' cool as hell! #PuberMe #PuertoRicoRelief pic.twitter.com/UC9a7XtjZa \u2014 Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) September 28, 2017\n\nThank you Stephen. In return, here's me trying to look like a tough guy because I hadn't yet hit #puberme. #PuertoRicoRelief pic.twitter.com/WAzZ6kk6qb \u2014 nick kroll (@nickkroll) September 28, 2017\n\nThe talk show crew didn\u2019t waste any time sharing theirs. John Oliver is sporting some serious David Koresh glasses while Samantha Bee reminds us of the magic that was Sun-In and Liz Claiborne. James Corden smolders while he rocks some gently feathered hair and then there\u2019s a pic of Conan O\u2019Brien that you will never be able to unsee.\n\nDebbie Harry, Yvette Nicole Brown, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Monica Lewinsky, and Kumail Nanjiani were brave to share crucial moments during their hair journeys.\n\nInstagram Photo\n\nThen there\u2019s this pic of Weird Al Yankovic using a silly straw to drink out of a coconut. He actually looks kind of cool.\n\nClark Gregg is not wearing a bowtie. That bowtie is wearing Clark Gregg.\n\nAny excuse to share the moment this curtain supporting beast was unleashed \u2018pon da laaaadieees. #PuberMe https://t.co/2SSs13yaqP pic.twitter.com/lUvk6l7AMj \u2014 Clark Gregg (@clarkgregg) September 29, 2017\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda practically wins the #PuberMe challenge with this video.\n\nWe could barely recognize Ryan Seacrest and Andy Cohen in these pics.\n\nInstagram Photo\n\nThese snaps of Reese Witherspoon, America Ferrera, Aidy Bryant and Gina Rodriguez are just too adorable to be awkward.\n\nInstagram Photo\n\nInstagram Photo\n\nAnd here are some other #PuberMe pics that are sure to remind us that celebrities went through awkward phases just like us.\n\nIf it\u2019ll help #PuertoRicoRelief I\u2019ll happily #PuberMe, but all my adolescent pics are 100% awesome: https://t.co/VngrzRrlzu\u2014\n\nPatton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 29, 2017\n\nInstagram Photo\n\nInstagram Photo\n\n.@NickKroll & @StephenAtHome asked me to post a photo from an awkward age to support #PuertoRicoRelief. Here\u2019s one I took last year #PuberMe pic.twitter.com/6ccgSwNoBB \u2014 Mike Bloomberg (@MikeBloomberg) September 28, 2017\n\nHey @StephenAtHome I'm not a huge celebrity but I'm willing to play if it helps PuertoRico #PuberMe Puffy Hair and Teeth. pic.twitter.com/rhsx4nGcUX \u2014 Audra McDonald (@AudraEqualityMc) September 30, 2017\n\nI checked with @StephenAtHome, and he said a #PuberMe from me would count for #PuertoRicoRelief, so here's me w my cousin Judith: pic.twitter.com/qBGTrZHa3Y \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) September 30, 2017\n\n@StephenAtHome #PuberMe #Puerto Rico Relief Hollywood High.
