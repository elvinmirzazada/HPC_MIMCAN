That anger wasn't sexy or sustainable. That our hearts were still broken from trying so hard to fix it but no longer uncertain about whether or not we could. The finality nearly killed me, and I remember muttering, \u2018But what if we still went on dates?' He laughed sadly. \u2018Whatever you want.'\"\n\nDunham said that she and Antonoff decided that he would stay in their apartment while she would temporarily move in with her parents. It wasn't until months later that she finally got her own place. The actress revealed that though she \"used to love solitude,\" after her first relationship in college, \"the independence I had so prized was replaced with a mourning that could be sated only by consistent male company.\"\n\nIt wasn't until a friend expressed concern over going out to dinner alone that Dunham realized that she hadn't eaten by herself in ages. \"For an exquisite moment, rather than mourn the loss of my partner, I mourned the loss of my bravery. I used to have no problem staring into the face of the hostess when I said, \u2018Just one for dinner, thank you,'\" she said.\n\nEventually, the 31-year-old tested herself by taking baths, reading books, taking herself out to a restaurant and finally taking a walk alone in the country. She learned to \"tolerate herself,\" but also mentioned a possible new relationship.\n\n\"Someone would be coming over soon, the electric current of new romance in the air,\" she wrote. \"But I was still defining myself by what I had lost.\" Dunham then came up with things she liked to do alone, with a few ground rules: \"Do not mention work, work dinners, or masturbation.\"\n\n\"[I'd say] \u2018I'm good, just chugging along,'\" she revealed of what she'd say when friends checked in on her. \"But if I were being honest I'd answer them by saying that my heart could still ache for one home as I returned to myself in another.\"\n\nSee more on Dunham in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2F1280_gettyimages-634812938.jpg%3Fh%3D00cffbef&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-11/eto_news_daily_pete_ariana_110118.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/1280_gettyimages-634812938.jpg?h=00cffbef", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2F1280_lena_dunham_gettyimages-902434880.jpg%3Fh%3D2e976bc2&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fjack_antonoff_gettyimages-852661386.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2F1280_lena_dunham_jack_antonoff_gettyimages-633607398.jpg%3Fh%3D05e51c2a&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/1280_gettyimages-634812938.jpg?h=00cffbef", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/lena-dunham-opens-up-about-mourning-her-breakup-with-jack-antonoff-102144", "title": "Lena Dunham Opens Up About 'Mourning' Her Breakup With Jack Antonoff", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/1280_gettyimages-634812938.jpg?h=00cffbef", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The former 'Girls' star split with Antonoff in January, but is just starting to learn to be alone again.", "title": "Lena Dunham Opens Up About 'Mourning' Her Breakup With Jack Antonoff", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/lena-dunham-opens-up-about-mourning-her-breakup-with-jack-antonoff-102144", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The former 'Girls' star split with Antonoff in January, but is just starting to learn to be alone again.", "twitter": {"description": "The former 'Girls' star split with Antonoff in January, but is just starting to learn to be alone again.", "title": "Lena Dunham Opens Up About 'Mourning' Her Breakup With Jack Antonoff", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/lena-dunham-opens-up-about-mourning-her-breakup-with-jack-antonoff-102144", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/1280_gettyimages-634812938.jpg?h=00cffbef", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Lena Dunham Opens Up About 'Mourning' Her Breakup With Jack Antonoff | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Lena Dunham, Jack Antonoff, Splits", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
