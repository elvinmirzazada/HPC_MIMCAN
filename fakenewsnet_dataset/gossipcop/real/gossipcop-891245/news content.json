And arguably the buzziest one of them all is the Jordan Peele-led reboot of the classic science fiction series \u201cThe Twilight Zone.\u201d\n\nSo how did CBS All Access, a small but growing player in the high-stakes streaming wars, land the Oscar-winning writer and director of \u201cGet Out\u201d? \u201cWe actually had heard that Jordan was such a fan of the original series that he credits it to some extent with his interest in becoming an artist,\u201d Julie McNamara, executive VP, original content, CBS All Access, told TheWrap. \u201cHaving heard that, we pursued a conversation with him to see if that\u2019s something he would be interested in.\u201d\n\nIt won\u2019t be the first, or even second time the series has been rebooted. There have been two prior revivals of the classic series. The first aired for 110 episodes on CBS in 1985, and a second version, with Forest Whitaker in Rod Serling\u2019s famous role, ran for 43 episodes on UPN in the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cI personally have heard probably 10 different pitches on rebooting \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 over the years,\u201d continues McNamara, adding that none of them \u201chit the mark\u201d as a reason to bring the show back. That is, until Peele walked through that door.\n\n\u201cIt happens to coincide with a moment in the culture that feels specifically ripe for this show to come back,\u201d she said, likening \u201cGet Out\u201d to a two-hour episode that would feel right at home in Serling\u2019s original version. \u201cIt feels like right now Jordan\u2019s point of view on the world is very welcome through the use of this franchise.\u201d\n\nPeele echoed that thought when the project was announced last year: \u201cToo many times this year it\u2019s felt we were living in a twilight zone, and I can\u2019t think of a better moment to reintroduce it to modern audiences.\u201d\n\nPeele will not only executive produce the series, he\u2019ll host and narrate it as well. Principal photography began on Oct. 1 and McNamara said they\u2019re about to start production on the third episode. Sanaa Lathan and Adam Scott have been announced as the show\u2019s first two cast members, each starring in separate installments.\n\nThe title for Scott\u2019s episode \u2014 \u201cNightmare at 30,000 Feet\u201d \u2014 appears to be a reimagining of one of the most popular episodes of the original series\u2019 run. That episode, \u201cNightmare at 20,000 Feet,\u201d starred William Shatner as Bob Wilson, the only passenger on an airline flight to notice a hideous creature lurking outside the plane. Richard Donner (\u201cSuperman,\u201d 1978) was the episode\u2019s director, which was based on a short story of the same name by \u201cI Am Legend\u201d author Richard Matheson. It aired on Oct. 11, 1963.\n\nLathan\u2019s episode, meanwhile, is titled \u201cRewind.\u201d\n\nSerling created the original series, which ran for 80 episodes from 1959 to 1964, and used socially conscious storytelling to explore the human condition and culture of the times. The new series, which will debut sometime next year, is produced by CBS Television Studios in association with Peele\u2019s Monkeypaw Productions and Simon Kinberg\u2019s Genre Films. Peele and Kinberg serve as executive producers along with Win Rosenfeld, Audrey Chon, Carol Serling, Rick Berg and Greg Yaitanes.\n\n\u201cIn a really healthy way, it both scares him and exhilarates him to be taking this on,\u201d said McNamara. \u201cHe really reveres it.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/seinfeld-rewatchable-tv.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tim-Baysinger.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Cher-Fallon.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Tim-Baysinger.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/And-Just-Like-That-Sex-and-the-City-1.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jordan-peele-twilight-zone.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jordan-peele-twilight-zone.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Chelsea-Handler-and-Dolly-Parton.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jordan-peele-twilight-zone.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tim Baysinger", "Ryan Mach", "Loree Seitz", "Dessi Gomez", "Tv Reporter", "Tim.Baysinger Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/how-cbs-all-access-landed-jordan-peele-for-its-twilight-zone-reboot-get-out/", "title": "How CBS All Access Landed Jordan Peele for Its \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 Reboot", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How CBS All Access Landed Jordan Peele for Its 'Twilight Zone' Reboot - TheWrap", "description": "Programming chief tells TheWrap she's \"heard probably 10 different pitches on rebooting\" the classic sci-fi series", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/how-cbs-all-access-landed-jordan-peele-for-its-twilight-zone-reboot-get-out/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jordan-peele-twilight-zone.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-11-01T19:01:18+00:00"}, "author": "Tim Baysinger", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Tim Baysinger", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "How CBS All Access Landed Jordan Peele for Its \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 Reboot", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/how-cbs-all-access-landed-jordan-peele-for-its-twilight-zone-reboot-get-out/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-11-01T12:01:18-07:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Tim Baysinger", "parsely-tags": "adam_scott, cbs, cbs-all-access, jordan_peele, rod-serling, sanaa-lathan, twilight_zone", "article-tags": "adam_scott, cbs, cbs-all-access, jordan_peele, rod-serling, sanaa-lathan, twilight_zone}", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "news, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1541098878.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
