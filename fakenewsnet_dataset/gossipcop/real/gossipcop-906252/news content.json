Bloom celebrated his birthday with his father Colin at his side, who couldn\u2019t have looked more proud, cheering his son from the sidelines.\n\nHappy birthday Orlando!", "images": ["https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/c-324x235.png", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/shutterstock_editorial_14095570bb-scaled-e1694590840416-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9640561qi-1024x686-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/logo_transparent_background_small.png", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/9908329hl-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Depositphotos_153815706_original.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/5283354c33f9f50fe7ebd4bcbbf0f3f8-e1701075298121-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Depositphotos_153815706_original-696x1039.jpg"], "top_img": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Depositphotos_153815706_original.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zoe Grace"], "canonical_link": "https://omgcheckitout.com/orlando-bloom-celebrates-birthday-leonardo-dicaprio-race-cars-morocco/", "title": "Orlando Bloom Celebrates Birthday with Leonardo DiCaprio and Race Cars in Morocco", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Orlando Bloom celebrated his 41st birthday with Leonardo DiCaprio by attending the third race of the Formula E season in Marrakesh, Morocco on Friday.
