This year, we basked in all kinds of greenery, and 2016 found us floating back and forth between the equally dreamy rose quartz and serenity. This year, Pantone suggests a year filled with the rich and regal Ultra Violet.\n\nAccording to Pantone, \u201cUltra Violet suggests the mysteries of the cosmos, the intrigue of what lies ahead, and the discoveries beyond where we are now. The vast and limitless night sky is symbolic of what is possible and continues to inspire the desire to pursue a world beyond our own.\u201d Purple/violet is known to be a spiritual, and religious color, that calms and aids in balancing one\u2019s life and overcoming obstacles. It is also the color of royalty, courage, and justice. In a time where we need courage, leadership, and the ability to overcome obstacles, this color proves to be right on point.\n\nPantone also points out that the color \u201csymbolizes experimentation and non-conformity, spurring individuals to imagine their unique mark on the world, and push boundaries through creative outlets.\u201d This beautiful shade of purple is also a reminder of great musicians. Selena, Prince, Jimi Hendrix, and David Bowie all used the color as part of their image.\n\nFortunately, this fierce color is not reserved for musical geniuses. Ultra Violet is a fun color you can wear right now. It is a jewel-toned pop of color that will jazz up any neutrals in your wardrobe, and a nice fall-and-winter-friendly choice when you want to try something outside of burgundy, navy, dark green, or other such seasonal colors. If you\u2019re feeling bold, mix this color with other brights, like teal, cobalt blue, or yellow (purple and yellow are complimentary colors on the color wheel). For makeup, purple is a universally-flattering eye color; it also looks great as a bold matte lip, or a berry-hued manicure.\n\nPhoto: FashionLady\n\nReady to take the plunge into Pantone\u2019s Color of the Year?
