The Girls Trip star smiled as Streisand, who Haddish lovingly referred to as her \u201cbig sister,\u201d leaned in with her hand on her new pal\u2019s shoulder.\n\nBehind them, other partygoers helped themselves to the buffet of food \u2014 including Steisand\u2019s actor husband James Brolin \u2014 but the two stars were busy catching up on the latest musicians moving up the charts.\n\n\u201cJust so y\u2019all know I taught my big sister about @CardiB_ today,\u201d Haddish captioned the pic on Twitter.\n\n\u201cDid you teach her a verse too?\u201d asked a fan.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the comedian replied.\n\nSurprised fans were quite pleased to hear about the Haddish-Streisand friendship.\n\n\u201cI never knew until today how badly I need a Barbra Streisand/Tiffany Haddish buddy comedy,\u201d one Twitter user commented.\n\nI never knew until today how badly I need a Barbra Streisand/Tiffany Haddish buddy comedy \u2014 Bromona Quimby (@BromonaQuimby) November 26, 2017\n\nThere's too much amazing in one tweet!!!!! \u2014 Alp Ozcelik (@alplicable) November 26, 2017\n\nI NEED VIDEO. You can't just drop that bombshell and then twirl out the door. \u2014 Rachel Scheer (@bigElittleR) November 26, 2017\n\nHaddish is clearly a fan of the rapper, sending her a tweet that read, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d on Sunday.\n\nIt\u2019s been a whirlwind month for the red hot comedienne, who is gearing up to set out on her nationwide \u201cShe Ready\u201d tour.\n\nShe recently got to live out her childhood dream of hosting Saturday Night Live on Nov. 11. Between delivering the show\u2019s cold open and playing everything from a hilariously lackluster video game character to a way too frisky cat lady, the pressure to perform was at an all time high.\n\nRelated: Tiffany Haddish On the Time Jada Pinkett-Smith Called Her Out for Wearing Fake Designer Bag\n\n\u201cThat was the most stressful week!\u201d Haddish told PEOPLE exclusively, in her first interview following the show. \u201cI\u2019m about 7 lbs. lighter. I call it the SNL stress diet. I feel like I just had a baby!\u201d\n\nHaddish, this year\u2019s breakout star thanks to her hilarious role in the summer blockbuster Girls Trip, said she got a major pep talk from her A-list costars. \u201cBefore the show, Jada [Pinkett-Smith] told me \u2018You better tear it up, destroy it, represent for all of us!\u2019\u201d recalls Haddish. \u201cAnd Queen [Latifah] told me the same thing.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171127185036im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tiffany-haddish1.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C901px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127185036im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127185036im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/article-covers/3313_106804645_2016_05_02_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127185036im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tiffany-haddish1.jpg?w=901", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127185036im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127185036im_/http://people.com/img/sign-up-bg.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127185036im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tiffany-haddish1.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C901px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127185036/http://people.com/movies/tiffany-haddish-teaches-barbra-streisand-about-cardi-b/", "title": "Tiffany Haddish Hangs Out with 'Big Sister' Barbra Streisand \u2014 and Teaches Her About Cardi B", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Tiffany Haddish Teaches Barbra Streisand About Cardi B, Tiffany Haddish, Tiffany Haddish hangs out with barbra streisand, barbra streisand, cardi b", "news_keywords": "Tiffany Haddish Teaches Barbra Streisand About Cardi B, Tiffany Haddish, Tiffany Haddish hangs out with barbra streisand, barbra streisand, cardi b", "description": "If\u00a0Barbra Streisand drops a cover of \"Bodak Yellow,\" you can thank Tiffany Haddish for making that musical magic happen", "og": {"title": "Tiffany Haddish Hangs Out with 'Big Sister' Barbra Streisand \u2014 and Teaches Her About Cardi B", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127185036/http://people.com/movies/tiffany-haddish-teaches-barbra-streisand-about-cardi-b/", "description": "If\u00a0Barbra Streisand drops a cover of \"Bodak Yellow,\" you can thank Tiffany Haddish for making that musical magic happen", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127185036im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tiffany-haddish1.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C901px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://people.com/movies/tiffany-haddish-teaches-barbra-streisand-about-cardi-b/", "description": "If\u00a0Barbra Streisand drops a cover of \"Bodak Yellow,\" you can thank Tiffany Haddish for making that musical magic happen", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tiffany-haddish1.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C901px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127185036im_/http://people.com/movies/tiffany-haddish-teaches-barbra-streisand-about-cardi-b/", "title": "Tiffany Haddish Hangs Out with 'Big Sister' Barbra Streisand \u2014 and Teaches Her About Cardi B", "description": "If\u00a0Barbra Streisand drops a cover of \"Bodak Yellow,\" you can thank Tiffany Haddish for making that musical magic happen", "site": "@people", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171127185036im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tiffany-haddish1.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C901px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
