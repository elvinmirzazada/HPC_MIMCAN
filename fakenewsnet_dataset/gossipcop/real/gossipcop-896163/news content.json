Over the Thanksgiving holiday, Carey admitted to not feeling so well.\n\nAccording to the original scheduling, the tour should have kicked off on November 17, however, Carey will now officially take the stage December 2 in New York City.\n\nThe singer took to social media to announce the news to her fans.\n\n\u201cI hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving with loved ones; it\u2019s certainly nice to remember what we are grateful for! Like most, I\u2019m thankful for my overall health\u2026 for which I need a bit more time to get right. Doctors have ordered a few extra days of rest before I can finally fly to New York and take the stage for my Christmas Tour.\u201d Carey continued, \u201cWhile this news disappoints me to share, I am grateful to be on the mend and for the support from all of you \u2013 it means the world to me! See you from the stage soon darlings!
