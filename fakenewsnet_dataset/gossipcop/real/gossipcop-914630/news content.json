February 16 marks ten years since that fateful day Britney Spears hit rock bottom and shaved her head at Esther\u2019s Haircutting Studio in Tarzana, California. Take a look back at the pop princess\u2019 public breakdown, how she has since reclaimed her throne and all the moments in between in the video above, and detailed below.\n\nThe date was February 16, 2007. Spears, then 25, walked into the hair salon at approximately 7 p.m. and asked owner Esther Tognozzi to shave off her then-brunette locks, just one day after checking herself in and out of rehab. When Tognozzi refused, Spears (who was reportedly battling addiction, an undisclosed mental illness and in the midst of a bitter custody battle with ex Kevin Federline) took matters into her own hands, grabbing the buzzer and shaving off all her hair.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Britney Spears' Most Iconic Moments Britney Spears has gone through her fair share of highs and lows \u2014 click through to see the pop superstar's most iconic moments\n\n\u201cThe only emotions that she showed was when she said her mom [Lynne Spears] was going to be mad that she was doing this to her hair and she got a little bit teary-eyed,\u201d Tognozzi told Extra at the time. \u201cThen she all of a sudden realized what she did.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving the salon, a newly bald Spears headed to the Body & Soul tattoo parlor in Sherman Oaks, California, where she got inked on her hip and her wrist. When asked by an employee why she just shaved her hair off, Spears replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want anyone touching me. I\u2019m tired of everybody touching me,\u201d as Us Weekly reported at the time.\n\nThe pop superstar\u2019s longtime assistant, Felicia Culotta, wrote an email saying Spears\u2019 family and friends were trying to get her help, but she wouldn\u2019t hear of it. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much you can do to help a person,\u201d Culotta wrote. \u201cI cannot convince her in ANY way to love herself. \u2026 I cannot save her from herself, nor can I commit her to any type of treatment program against her wishes and will.\u201d\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Britney Spears' Us Weekly Covers Through the Years The comeback queen!

Days after buzzing her hair, she was photographed attacking a paparazzo\u2019s car with an umbrella, an image that instantly went global. That September, Spears took the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards, opening the show with a lackluster performance of her new single \u201cGimme More\u201d from her album Blackout.\n\nThe Grammy winner hit her breaking point in January 2008 when she was hospitalized on a 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold after refusing to turn her sons, Sean Preston, then 2, and Jayden James, then 14 months, over to Federline. Luckily, the incident set the stage for recovery.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: 2000s Pop Stars, Then and Now From Hilary Duff to Rihanna, our favorite 2000s pop stars have changed so much over the years \u2014 click through to see where they are now\n\nSpears regained visitation rights to her boys and released her chart-topping sixth album, Circus, in 2008. Her song \u201cPiece of Me\u201d won three VMAs that year, including Video of the Year. She continued to prove that she was still capable of releasing pop hits with her 2011 album, Femme Fatale. Spears found love again too. She got engaged to Jason Trawick in December 2011, but the couple called it quits in January 2013.\n\nIn 2012, the entertainer earned a seat on the X Factor judging panel, but left the now-defunct U.S. version of the singing competition after one season. A year later, she released what she called her \u201cmost personal album ever,\u201d the self-titled Britney Jean. The album led to Spears\u2019 hugely successful Las Vegas residency, Britney: Piece of Me, which has since grossed more than $100 million.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Britney Spears' Bikini Body Through the Years See Britney Spears' bikini body and swim style evolution, from 2001 to today in photos!\n\nLast year, Spears dropped her ninth album, Glory, which fans lauded as the singer\u2019s best in nearly a decade. To promote the record, she made a triumphant return to the VMAs stage, performing for the first time since 2007.\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
