According to the insider, the Vampire Diaries alum's busy schedule played a part in the decision.\n\n\"She's filming a lot,\" the source says.\n\nA rep for Dobrev couldn't be reached for comment.\n\nE! News, who first reported the news, reports that there \"hasn't been an official 'split' \" or any major fights between the two. According to the outlet, Powell \u2014 whose acting credits include Hidden Figures, Ride Along 2, and The Expendables 3 \u2014 is a \"very easy-going dude\" who avoids drama if he can.\n\n\"They are still seeing each other,\"a source told the outlet. \"But have cooled things off a little because of busy schedules.\"\n\nDobrev, 28, and Powell, 29, had been rumored to be dating since January after ringing in the New Year with friends in Texas. That same month, Powell was spotted at the Los Angeles premiere of Dobrev's film xXX: Return of Xander Cage, and they attended a Golden Globes afterparty together.\n\nHe was also at her La La Land-themed birthday party, where they recreated the signature pose from the Oscar-winning film.\n\nPEOPLE confirmed the two were dating after intimate photo booth pictures of them surfaced from Julianne Hough's stunning Idaho wedding to hockey player Brooks Laich on July 8.\n\nThe couple recently attended the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and InStyle's celebration of the 75th Anniversary of the Golden Globe Awards on Nov. 15.\n\nThough Dobrev arrived after Powell, who walked the red carpet solo, the two met up inside the soir\u00e9e and spent the evening at each other's side, leaving in the same car at the end of the night.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Can Nina Dobrev Go from No Makeup to Red Carpet Ready in 90 Seconds?\n\nThe duo spent the Thanksgiving holiday apart, and Powell told PEOPLE at the event that he would be returning to his ranch in Texas.\n\n\"Sometimes when your jeans get too tight, and the V's in your shirt get too deep, you've got to go back to Texas,\" he quipped, adding that he'd definitely be \"eating a lot.\"\n\n\"My body's going to come back looking very different,\" he said. \"I'll say Texas is good for the soul, but not good for the body.\"\n\n\"I'm going to come back [to Los Angeles] for probably a couple of weeks, and then I'm going to go back for Christmas and just decompress,\" he said. \"Spend some time on the ranch and try to be a man again. Sometimes L.A. it just pampers you too much. It just takes the masculinity out of you.\"\n\n\u2014 With reporting by MARIAH HAAS", "images":
