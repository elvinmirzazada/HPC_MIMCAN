It ended a year and a half of claims made by both the star and his former managers that captivated headlines.\n\n\u201cJohnny Depp is pleased to have achieved a settlement agreement with The Management Group following the legal action he took against the company in January 2017,\u201d an attorney for Depp says in a statement to PEOPLE. \u201cThe lawsuit taken out against The Management Group \u00adand the subsequent settlement is a further demonstration that Johnny is determined to take firm action to protect his personal and artistic reputation in the interests of his family and his career.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cFollowing the settlement, Johnny is pleased to be able to revert his full attention to his ongoing artistic endeavors, notably the second leg of the sold-out Hollywood Vampires global tour and the exciting launch of JK Rowling\u2019s Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, which will be released in theaters in November this year. Johnny extends his most sincere thanks and appreciation to the true supporters that have shown their loyalty to both him and his family over recent years.\u201d\n\nHarry Durrant/Getty Images\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean star sued his former business team at The Management Group (TMG) for $25 million in a fraud lawsuit in January 2017. TMG fired back with a cross-complaint the next month, claiming the actor lived an \u201cultra-extravagant lifestyle that often knowingly cost Depp in excess of $2 million per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford.\u201d\n\nDepp claimed in his initial complaint that his managers\u2019 negligence had cost him millions, but in their response, TMG painted him as a compulsive spender who blew his $650 million fortune on mansions, yachts, cars, collectables and booze.\n\nThe actor attempted to set the record straight on his spending in an expansive interview with Rolling Stone last month, where he upped the figures on some of the spending claims made by TMG.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insulting to say that I spent $30,000 on wine,\u201d Depp said, referring to the suit alleging that the actor spent that much on wine a month. \u201cBecause it was far more.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Lawsuit Claims Johnny Depp Is in Financial Crisis Due to Spending $2 Million a Month on \u2018Ultra-Extravagant Lifestyle\u2019\n\nHe also took issue with another TMG claim concerning the cost of shooting his friend and famed journalist Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s ashes out of a cannon. TMG claimed the send-off cost $3 million, but Depp puts the figure a tad higher.\n\n\u201cBy the way, it was not $3 million to shoot Hunter into the f\u2014\u2013 sky,\u201d Depp corrected. \u201cIt was $5 million.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Depp admitted the legal battle had taken a personal toll. \u201cMy son had to hear about how his old man lost all his money from kids at school, that\u2019s not right,\u201d he complained.", "images":
