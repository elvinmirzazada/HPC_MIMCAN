Kourtney innocently asked the firefighters of her suit.\n\n'Obviously,' laughed Khloe.\n\nDamsel in distress: Kris Jenner needed to be rescued by Kourtney during the exercise\n\nFirst responders: Khloe also took part in the exercise after growing frustrated with Kourtney\n\nThe pair then had to break through a locked door before Kourtney slowly decided on which kind of ladder to use as her mom shouted for help from inside.\n\n'Come on Kourt mom could be in there dying,' said Khloe as a coughing Kris emerged from the smoke for a breath of fresh air.\n\n'Dead. Someone died with how indecisive you were, someone just died,' Khloe chastised her sister to the cameras.\n\nJust died: Khloe joked that their mother just died due to Kourtney's indecisiveness\n\nEventually Kourtney decided on a roof ladder but that was not big enough and she slowly directed the firefighters to use a bigger one to get them up to the roof.\n\nBut when she got on top of the building Kourtney had forgotten her axe and needed a firefighter to bring it up to her.\n\nWhen it was retrieved she was made to hack her way through a wooden 'roof' with Khloe shouting for her to imagine it was Scott Disick.\n\nVisualization technique: Kourtney was urged to think about Scott Disick while breaking down a door\n\nThat seemed to do the trick and she crashed the axe through the wooden panelling.\n\nKourtney and a scared Khloe then had to climb back down from the roof on a ladder as Khloe yelled about how she hated heights.\n\nKourtney then entered the smoke-filled building but it was Khloe who snuck in and helped get Kris back to safety.\n\nUp there: The sisters climbed a ladder while rescuing their mother in the exercise\n\n'Is that what it's like guys, you cannot see? That was intense,' said a relieved Kourtney.\n\n'Don't you have a new found respect for firefighters? I just think that hey, you didn't rescue your mom,' Khloe teased her.\n\n'I was claustrophobic,' said Kourtney defensively before posing for pictures in her firefighting gear.\n\nExercise complete: Kourtney smiled while undergoing the exercise\n\nThe activity came about after Kim grew weary of Kourtney, telling her that she was 'the most annoying, indecisive person on the planet' as she tried on clothes for a potential New York trip.\n\n'I asked Kourtney months ago to come to New York for Fashion Week and she has still not given me a solid answer,' Kim told the cameras.\n\nBut her sister said she would not know until the last minute if she was going.\n\nMost annoying: Kim Kardashian was getting fed up with her older sister's inability to make a decision\n\n'Kourtney is truly the most indecisive person I have ever met in my entire life,' added a frustrated Kim.\n\n'I mean if you can't decide don't come,' Kim told her as Kourtney said she would make the trip.\n\nRob hit Gunnar Peterson's gym with life coach Jamel Davenport and told the fitness expert that he 'was not spoken for.'\n\nNo decision: Kourtney could not commit to going to New York Fashion Week with Kim\n\nThe father of one told Peterson that when he spent time with the baby his whole life 'went on lockdown mode, which is a good thing.'\n\n'In the past when I was super depressed I disconnected with literally everyone, but I am not going to go back to that dark place. I am just going to focus on being healthy and being in the gym and working every day and getting better lately,' said Rob.\n\nKim got aboard her private jet flight to New York for Kanye's fashion show only for Kourtney to cancel as they sat waiting for her to arrive.\n\nCelebrity trainer: Gunnar Peterson was working out Rob Kardashian\n\n'I felt like God was telling me not to come,' she told Kim on the phone.\n\n'You need some serious therapy, who would do a full fitting, pack a full bag and then not come?' said an exasperated Kim.\n\n'It is so annoying that you are this indecisive. Are you going to pay for half of this plane or are you now stiffing me with the whole bill?' Kim asked as Kourtney assured her she would cover her expenses.\n\nBailed out: Kim was annoyed as Kourtney bailed out at the last minute\n\nIn New York, Kim enjoyed high tea with her friend Simon Huck and told him she was was very happy with her 'great' new security team.\n\n'They are so on top of it,' she told him as they ate at the swanky Plaza Hotel.\n\nKim told her pal that Rob had called her and told him he planned 'to be chill' with Black Chyna on social media.\n\nCatching up: Simon Huck got the latest on Rob from Kim over dinner\n\n'I know that Rob really wants to keep his family together but I do think that this is a good path for them so that they are both happy. Everything is a life lesson and I just hope that they can be great parents and just have a good relationship,' she said.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Rob told his life coach that he wanted a friendship with his ex.\n\n'It kills me that we cannot at least speak and be friends,' he said.\n\nNot friends: Rob lamented not being friends with Blac Chyna\n\n'We should at least be able to have that relationship for the sake of our baby and each other. I love her as a friend and that is important to me to have that relationship.'\n\nHis coach told him that Rob had to be an inspiration to himself and a positive person to achieve that situation.\n\nKhloe then sat down with mom Kris for lunch and told her that she could no longer stand 'how f***ing annoying Kourtney is with just doing anything.'\n\nPractical joke: Kris and Khloe sent Kourtney on a wild goose chase to show her how it feels\n\n'After hearing how Kourt bailed on Kim for the New York thing, Kourt does not get that her lack of decision making does affect other people,' said Khloe.\n\nKhloe then rang her sister to mess with her and told her to drive to a string of different restaurants to meet them.\n\n'I'm making her just feel what it feels like when someone is that indecisive,' said Khloe as Kourtney drove around trying to find them.\n\nHungry driver: Kourtney drove around hungry as Khloe kept changing the destination\n\n'She sounds pissed, so I don't really know if this experiment is as funny as I find it to be,' said Khloe as Kris warned that Kourtney 'may kill you.'\n\nWhen Kourtney finally arrived she was not impressed at the 'wild goose chase.'\n\n'You had me driving around in circles because you thought it was funny? How is that going to teach me anything?' she said.\n\nNot funny: The mother of three did not think the prank was funny\n\nKris told her it was because her indecisiveness and Kourtney agreed that it was now 'debilitating.'\n\nIn Los Angeles, Rob left a dentist's office wearing a mask over his face but that did not prevent him from visiting Chyna on a photoshoot to support her.\n\n'I am really nervous, I really don't know what to expect,' he told the cameras as he arrived, still wearing his mask.\n\nMask on: Rob wore a mask after a visit to the dentist's office while talking to personal coach Jamel Davenport\n\nIt started badly as Rob and his life coach interrupted Chyna with no clothes on, leaving him feel immediately unwelcome.\n\n'Chyna is acting super-weird to me, there is just so much tension between Chyna and I. I have no idea how to be around her,' he told the cameras.\n\nRob later told the life coach that the experience 'did not make me happy or want to stay there.'\n\nBad timing: Chyna was not dressed when Rob dropped by to show support for her photoshoot\n\nFrosty meeting: Rob didn't stay long and felt like he overstayed his welcome quickly\n\n'Everything is just off, it bugs me and it's frustrating,' admitted Rob.\n\nIn New York, Kylie's pop up event was a huge success as thousands of her fans mobbed the store to meet her.\n\nKim showed up to support her sister and ended up giving away lip kits to the fans for her sister.\n\nShowing support: Kim showed support for Kylie at her new pop-up store in New York City\n\nAt Khloe's house she and best pal Malika set up activities to teach Kourtney to be a better decision maker.\n\n'This is just a little experiment to make you think fast, be decisive, get your s*** together and stop being the most indecisive human being of all time,' said Khloe.\n\nMalika tried to distract Kourtney while she had to make quick decision on what gifts to give family members on a white board.\n\nHelping hand: Malika tried to help Khloe teach Kourtney a lesson\n\nKhloe then held up cards and Kourtney had to make a decision on which one she preferred.\n\n'This is such a joke, just none of this is helpful and I am getting a headache,' complained Kourtney.\n\nKhloe then asked her if she wanted to get pregnant or not get pregnant.\n\nGame time: Khloe used a gift game to help Kourtney make decisions quicker\n\n'Who am I getting pregnant with? This is pointless,' said Kourtney.\n\nIn New York, Kim attended Kanye West's fashion show and assured him backstage how good she thought it would be.\n\nKim sat next to Vogue editor Anna Wintour as the show took place with the models seen inside a giant cube.\n\nFashion show: Kanye West met up with wife Kim before his fashion show\n\nFront row: Kim sat next to Vogue editor Anna Wintour during Kanye's fashion show\n\n'Kanye has worked so hard at this show and it was so great and visually exciting to see, it makes me so proud,' Kim told the cameras.\n\nIn Calabasas, Kris asked Rob about his relationship with Chyna.\n\n'Everything is fine. I am trying to just be peaceful. We just communicate really poorly, it is all dumb fights,' Rob told her.\n\nCandid conversation: Rob talked to his mother Kris about his strained relationship with Chyna\n\nHe then told his mom how much he admired her 'healthy' relationship with dad Rob Kardashian, even when they were no longer together.\n\n'We only remember the positive, there is never anything negative,' he told his mom.\n\n'We were better best friends than we were being married. It took us 18 years to realize that. He was mad, I was mad but after everybody settled down it was a conscious decision to be adults and to be inclusive,' she told Rob.\n\nWorking on it: The reality star said he was determined to establsih a relationship with Chyna for their daughter Dream\n\nRob told her 'it would kill me' if he could not establish that sort of relationship with Chyna.\n\n'I think for Rob to understand that it does take perseverance and determination to get to the place that Robert and I were, and still be willing to work things out with Chyna is truly remarkable,' said Kris.\n\n'I hope that Rob and Chyna truly find a way to get there.'\n\nKill him: Rob told Kris that it would 'kill' him if he was unable to work something out with Chyna\n\nRob and Chyna both took Dream for a doctor's visit and to get shots.\n\n'I hate that our relationship is a little uncomfortable but I am very committed to building that friendship between Chyna and I,' Rob said.\n\n'The type of relationship I had with my dad is what I want with my daughter and I am trying to be the best for baby Dream as everything I am doing is for her.'\n\nTender moment: Chyna and Rob took Dream to see a doctor and get some shots\n\nTo end the show Kourtney told her sisters she had taken steps to work on her issues.\n\n'Clearly my indecisiveness is affecting everyone. Doing all these exercises made me want to do something to be more decisive so last night I watched the Tony Robbins documentary and I feel like it helped me get to the root of it,' Kourtney announced.\n\n'Scott and I were very codependent and I just would always bounce every idea of him and also I am living a different life now where doing more for myself is like an option.\n\nLesson learned: Kourtney told her family that she was working on her issues\n\n'Now I am able to make my own decisions I want to make the best decisions and Tony Robbins taught me to make decisions from the heart and not the head and I had a million reasons to justify going to New York but in my heart it was telling me to stay home and I want to start listening.'\n\nKhloe told her sister that she was proud of her for taking steps in the right direction.\n\nIn a teaser for next week Kim told Kris that she had read Caitlyn Jenner's book.\n\nProud sister: Khloe was proud of Kourtney for taking steps in the right direction\n\n'Stop. And?' Kris asked her daughter.\n\n'Everything is always your fault,' she told Kris.\n\nKUWTK returns next week on the E! channel.", "images":
