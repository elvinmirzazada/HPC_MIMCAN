Check out Beth living her best life in that limo.\n\nRon Batzdorff/NBC Metz shares a hug with co-star Caitlin Thompson (Madison).\n\nWith just three new episodes left this season, there's lots to process: In addition to grieving our beloved Jack (Milo Ventimiglia), celebrating Kate and Toby's impending nuptials, worrying about Kevin (Justin Hartley) and his sobriety, and crossing our fingers for Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and Beth's new restoration business, we'll also see plenty more flashbacks of Jack and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) in happier times.\n\nRon Batzdorff/NBC Randall (Sterling K. Brown), Toby (Chris Sullivan) and Kevin (Justin Hartley) have a little Vegas-style fun.\n\nOne pic from the upcoming episode shows America's favorite couple holding each other close at what looks to be an anniversary party.\n\nRon Batzdorff Rebecca and Jack in happier times.\n\nIn other words, keep the tissues close \u2014 as usual.\n\n\"This Is Us\" returns to NBC at 9 p.m. EST on Tuesday, Feb. 27, and we can't wait!", "images":
