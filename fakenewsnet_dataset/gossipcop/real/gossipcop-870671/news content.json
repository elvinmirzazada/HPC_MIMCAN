The alleged drunk driver rounded a bend when he crossed his pickup truck into oncoming traffic and struck Macklemore\u2019s Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThe alleged drunk driver, who was not wearing a seatbelt, smashed his head into the windshield, leaving him briefly unconscious. He was taken to a local hospital for treatment, and was subsequently charged with a DUI.\n\nRelated Video\n\nOne of Macklemore\u2019s passengers was treated for a minor cut to the head, but all three people walked away from the accident.", "images": ["https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/godsmack-2024-north-american-tour.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip",
