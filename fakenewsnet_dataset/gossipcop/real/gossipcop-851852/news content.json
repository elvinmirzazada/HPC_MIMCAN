Scott's real name is Jacques Webster.\n\nDoug Norwood of Rogers, who represented Scott, said the case was resolved last month.\n\n\"They overcharged him,\" Norwood told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. \"They tried to get him for inciting a riot. The video did not show any of that.\"\n\nAfter the concert, the Rogers Police Department wrote on Facebook that Webster \"encouraged people to rush the stage\" during his show at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion in Rogers. He was taken to the Benton County jail.\n\nThe rapper \u2014 who became a father Sunday when Kylie Jenner of Keeping up with the Kardashians fame gave birth to their daughter \u2014 is reportedly required to pay $6,825.31 to two people who said they were injured at the May 13 performance. He also must pay $640 in court associated costs, one of his attorneys told the newspaper.\n\nNorwood told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he believes the charge can later be expunged from Scott's record.", "images": ["https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2018/02/06/162501751_Travis-Scott_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676", "https://media.arkansasonline.com/img/photos/2018/04/06/crime_copy.png", "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2018/02/06/162501751_Travis-Scott_t800.jpg?90232451fbcadccc64a17de7521d859a8f88077d", "https://media.arkansasonline.com/static/ao_redesign/dist/img/adg-logo.svg", "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/ao_redesign/dist/img/adg-logo-white-alt.svg"], "top_img": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2018/02/06/162501751_Travis-Scott_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Arkansas Online"], "canonical_link": "https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/feb/06/rapper-arrested-after-arkansas-concert-pleads-guil/", "title": "Rapper arrested after Arkansas concert pleads guilty to disorderly conduct", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A rapper who was arrested after his Arkansas concert in May has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.", "og": {"title": "Rapper arrested after Arkansas concert pleads guilty to disorderly conduct | Arkansas Democrat Gazette", "type": "article", "url": "/news/2018/feb/06/rapper-arrested-after-arkansas-concert-pleads-guil/", "image": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2018/02/06/162501751_Travis-Scott_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-06T15:37:55-0600"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@arkansasonline", "creator": "@arkansasonline", "title": "Rapper arrested after Arkansas concert pleads guilty to disorderly conduct", "description": "A rapper who was arrested after his Arkansas concert in May has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.", "image": "https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2018/02/06/162501751_Travis-Scott_t600.jpg?4326734cdb8e39baa3579048ef63ad7b451e7676"}, "category": "[News] /Root/News/arkansas, [News] /Root/News/Arkansas/crime, [News] /Root/News/Arkansas/northwest, [News] /Root/News/Arkansas/Northwest/crime,"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517868000.0, "source": "https://www.arkansasonline.com", "summary": ""}
