Writing for Australian news website, Honey, an exhausted Juliet Rieden told of how this tour has seen the royal couple gain an international seal of approval, while sending \u201c her circadian rhythms into meltdown.\u201d She said: \u201cAs a seasoned royal correspondent, I like to think I\u2019m well versed in the madness and mayhem of royal tours but this inaugural Commonwealth love-in with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had surprises at every turn and a pace that has sent my circadian rhythms into meltdown. \u201cIt started with a baby announcement that blind-sided us all. While the tabloids have been on bump watch since the couple announced their engagement, no-one really believed that Meghan would embark on a 16-day marathon tour with 76 engagements while pregnant. Even the UK royal watchers weren\u2019t in on this secret, which is saying something. \u201cOf course \u2018pregnant women works\u2019, is not the stuff of headlines, this is 2018 after all. But the royal couple weren\u2019t just touring Australia and New Zealand; Fiji and Tonga were an important part of the itinerary, nations beloved by Her Majesty who were aching for a royal visit, especially one from the House of Windsor\u2019s new super couple.\u201d\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry kickstarted their first royal tour as a married couple, landing in Sydney, Australia on Tuesday, October 16. But the determined duchess began the trip as she meant to go on, attending an engagement despite suffering from the \"double whammy\" of jet lag and pregnancy. She\u2019d woke up at 4.30am to do some yoga, telling a group at Bondi beach that yoga was \"so good for healing your mind\". Days later the crowd went wild for the duchess as Harry and Meghan received a joyous welcome at the delayed Opening Ceremony of the fourth ever Invictus Games. The pair still beamed with joy despite an electrical storm sparking chaos in Sydney earlier the same day.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex smiles during a visit to Tupou College\n\nHarry and Meghan on Bondi Beach in Australia\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry arrive in New Zealand\n\nBecome an Express Premium member Support fearless journalism\n\nSupport fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online, advert free\n\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-day\n\nFREE trial\n\nBut as Meghan started to flag and skipped some of the pair\u2019s planned engagements, so questions were raised as to whether the duchess would be able to visit Fiji and Tonga at all - with World Health Organisation advises against pregnant women travelling to those countries due to the Zika virus. After Harry faced a bumpy ride to Fraser Island to unveil a plaque alone, royal fans were certain that the duchess would pull out on a visit to Fiji altogether. But Ms Rieden praised Meghan for proving spectators wrong and going ahead with an \u201cincredible trip\u201d to Fiji and seemingly being \u201ctotally unfazed by the mozzies\u201d. The royal pair joined an exhibition with Princess Angelika of Tonga on the 11th day of the tour, who called the couple \u201can inspiration to the youth of the Commonwealth\u201d for \u201cshining a light on youth empowerment\u201d.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex congratulating the United States Wheelchair Basketball team after winning Gold\n\nThe couple at Consular House in Tonga on the first day of
