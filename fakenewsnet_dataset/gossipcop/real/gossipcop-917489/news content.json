Not just to sound adorable, but the truth is she gets me more than anyone else has ever gotten me,\u201d he gushed. \u201cAnd so she allows me to, for lack of a better term, bottom out for a second and get really scared.\u201d\n\nRichard Young/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThey share two daughters together, 4-year-old Hazel and 18-month-old Violet. The couple began dating in 2008, but The Office alum admitted he was starstruck by his famous girlfriend, despite being prohibited by Blunt to speak of their jobs while together.\n\n\u201cWhen we first started dating, that was weird,\u201d he said. \u201cI was definitely aware of [her fame], probably in a way that could have been extremely unhealthy if it wasn\u2019t for how insanely down-to-earth she was.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI remember being at my house and saying to her, \u2018So I just want to have this really honest conversation. I think you\u2019re one of the best act\u2014\u2019 I didn\u2019t even get out \u2018actress.\u2019 She went, \u2018No, no, no, no!\u2019 Very loud. We didn\u2019t have that conversation again for a really long time, and it saved our relationship.\u201d\n\nPlayboy\n\nKrasinski also touched on his thoughts about the #MeToo movement and how he realized he had never asked Blunt about her own experiences until the movement made it to the mainstream.\n\n\u201cWe definitely had the conversation once it blew up to the level that it did,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt terrible and borderline embarrassed that I hadn\u2019t asked her about it. I was like, \u2018Have you ever had a bad experience?\u2019 I think she said in Vanity Fair, like, \u2018I\u2019ve had my bum pinched a couple of times, but\u2026\u2019\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cFirst of all, I believe I can\u2019t add anything to the conversation. There\u2019s so much that has been said and is continuing to be said, and all the things that need to be said are at least out there and on the table now. What we actually piece through and how on to in that conversation, I think, is the most important now.\u201d\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page.

They\u2019re going through something they should really be talking about with each other and a therapist, and they can\u2019t. We not only thought the story was so unique and different that there was no way our marriage could supersede it, but that, weirdly, our marriage fit right in.\u201d", "images":
