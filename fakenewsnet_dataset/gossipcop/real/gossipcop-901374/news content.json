Dyrdek took to Instagram on Friday to announce the news, alongside his first photo as a family of four.\n\n\"She is an angel from heaven. She is absolute perfection. She is our princess. She is Nala Ryan Dyrdek,\" he captioned a slideshow of pics featuring his newborn daughter. \"So thankful for the strength of my amazing wife and grateful for our growing family.\"\n\nBryiana also shared her excitement over baby No. 2, writing, \"My heart has never been more full than it is right now. @robdyrdek thank you for being the most amazing and supportive husband and the best daddy in the whole world! Kodah, your sissy is so lucky to have you as her big brother and I am so, so proud of you! Nala Ryan Dyrdek, welcome to our family. You are loved beyond measure and there will never be a moment in your life that goes by where you aren't reminded of that \u2764.\"\n\nDyrdek tied the knot with Bryiana in 2015, and they welcomed their first child, son Kodah Dash Dyrdek, just one year later. The couple learned in June that they were expecting a baby girl.\n\nSee more on Dyrdek in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-09/1280_rob_dyrdek_bryiana_dyrdek_Getty497405302.jpg", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-09%2F1280_rob_dyrdek_bryiana_dyrdek_Getty497405302.jpg&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-03%2F1280_rob_dyrdek_instagram.jpg&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-09%2F1280_rob_dyrdek_bryiana_dyrdek_Getty497405302.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-05%2Frobbigobitnew_12810_hulu.jpg&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-09/1280_rob_dyrdek_bryiana_dyrdek_Getty497405302.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/rob-dyrdek-welcomes-baby-girl-wife-bryiana-find-out-her-name-93314", "title": "Rob Dyrdek Welcomes Baby Girl With Wife Bryiana -- Find Out Her Name!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-09/1280_rob_dyrdek_bryiana_dyrdek_Getty497405302.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The couple are already parents to 1-year-old son Kodah.", "title": "Rob Dyrdek Welcomes Baby Girl With Wife Bryiana -- Find Out Her Name!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rob-dyrdek-welcomes-baby-girl-wife-bryiana-find-out-her-name-93314", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The couple are already parents to 1-year-old son Kodah.", "twitter": {"description": "The couple are already parents to 1-year-old son Kodah.", "title": "Rob Dyrdek Welcomes Baby Girl With Wife Bryiana -- Find Out Her Name!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rob-dyrdek-welcomes-baby-girl-wife-bryiana-find-out-her-name-93314", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-09/1280_rob_dyrdek_bryiana_dyrdek_Getty497405302.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Rob Dyrdek Welcomes Baby Girl With Wife Bryiana -- Find Out Her Name! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Babies & Kids, Rob Dyrdek", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
