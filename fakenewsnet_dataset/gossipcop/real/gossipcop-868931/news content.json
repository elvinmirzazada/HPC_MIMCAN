And I\u2019m grateful for the words they said on the panel the other day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible to be grateful for the opportunity and respectful of the colleagues and the people that I work with, and maintain a steadfast sense of your self-worth,\u201d he said.\n\nKim made headlines last month when he and co-star Grace Park exited the CBS police drama, raising questions about the pay disparity between them and their white counterparts, Scott Caan and Alex O\u2019Loughlin.\n\nShortly after his exit was announced, Kim wrote a post on Facebook confirming that he and CBS \u201cweren\u2019t able to agree to terms on a new contract.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll end by saying that though transitions can be difficult, I encourage us all to look beyond the disappointment of this moment to the bigger picture,\u201d the post read. \u201cThe path to equality is rarely easy. But I hope you can be excited for the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d showrunner Peter Lenkov later said Kim and Park turned down \u201cunprecedented raises\u201d in leaving the show, which CBS executive Kelly Kahl echoed at the network\u2019s presentation last week.\n\n\u201cWe love both those actors and did not want to lose them. We made very, very strong attempts to keep them and offered them a lot of money to stick around. We wanted them to stick around \u2026 We tried our darndest to keep them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHawaii Five-0\u201d launched in September 2010 and is a reboot of the original series that signed off in 1980 after 12 seasons. It stars O\u2019Loughlin (Steve McGarrett), Caan (Danno Williams), Chi McBride (Lou Grover) and Jorge Garcia (Jerry Ortega). Masi Oka (Max Bergman) left the show during Season 7.\n\nWhen the show returns for Season 8 on Sept. 29, Kim and Park will be replaced by new series regulars Ian Anthony Dale, Meaghan Rath and Beulah Koale.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Reid-Nakamura.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Reid-Nakamura.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Daniel-Dae-Kim-Hawaii-Five-0.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/helena-bonham-carter-nolly-pbs.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/TheAfterparty_201_03336F-scaled.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Daniel-Dae-Kim-Hawaii-Five-0.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/friday-night-lights-connie-britton.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-afterparty-season-2.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Daniel-Dae-Kim-Hawaii-Five-0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reid Nakamura", "Natalie Oganesyan", "Tv Reporter", "Reid.Nakamura Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/daniel-dae-kim-says-hawaii-five-0-exit-matter-self-worth/", "title": "Daniel Dae Kim Says \u2018Hawaii Five-0\u2019 Exit Was a Matter of \u2018Self-Worth\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Daniel Dae Kim Says 'Hawaii Five-0' Exit Was a Matter of 'Self-Worth' - TheWrap", "description": "TCA 2017: Kim and Grace Park exited CBS police drama over pay disparity with white co-stars", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/daniel-dae-kim-says-hawaii-five-0-exit-matter-self-worth/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Daniel-Dae-Kim-Hawaii-Five-0.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-08-06T18:20:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-07T23:24:15+00:00"}, "author": "Reid Nakamura", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Reid Nakamura", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Daniel Dae Kim Says \u2018Hawaii Five-0\u2019 Exit Was a Matter of \u2018Self-Worth\u2019", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/daniel-dae-kim-says-hawaii-five-0-exit-matter-self-worth/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-08-06T11:20:13-07:00", "parsely-section": "report-from-tca", "parsely-author": "Reid Nakamura", "parsely-tags": "cbs, daniel_dae_kim, hawaii_five-0, the-good-doctor", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502043613.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
