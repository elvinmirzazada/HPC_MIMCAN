There's nothing nice about it. It's just hard.\"\n\nJolie has been battling a laundry list of health issues in recent years -- she underwent a preventative double mastectomy in 2013, had her ovaries removed in 2015 and also recently developed hypertension and a Bell's Palsy diagnosis.\n\n\"Emotionally it\u2019s been a very difficult year,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I have some other health issues. So, my health is something I have to monitor.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar winner added that remaining positive is crucial for getting through the tough moments.\n\n\u201cI feel sometimes that my body has taken a hit, but I try to laugh as much as possible,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe tend to get so stressed that our children feel our stress when they need to feel our joy. Even if you are going through chemo, you need to find the ability to love and laugh. It may sound like a postcard, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nThe actress says that while she has no immediate acting or directorial projects in the pipeline, she does plan to focus on life at home with her six children -- Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and 9-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.\n\n\u201cI am going to cooking classes,\u201d she shares. \u201cCooking is one of those things you do when you are settled in your life and you can take the time. But, somehow I am just very impatient and I am a little bit erratic. But I am getting into it now. I feel like, if I cook, the kids can all hang out. Although, they often take over and tell me that they can do it better.\u201d\n\nCooking aside, Jolie also hopes to spend time nurturing her mental health and well-being.\n\n\u201cI think now I need to rediscover a little bit of the old me,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we lose our way a bit. I have had a lot happen in my life, from certain people passing to health issues to raising the children. And it\u2019s been a very good time to absorb and develop and grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut maybe now that my kids are growing up, I am starting to realize that my own sense of play has been put on hold for a while,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd maybe them hitting their teens is going to bring out a little more fun in Mom. So maybe I am going back. It may be time.\u201d\n\nFor more on how Jolie is coping with her divorce from Pitt, watch the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-08%2Fet_showclip_bradangie_081017_1280.jpg&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-07%2F1280_angelina_jolie_brad_pitt_magazines.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/1280_angelina_jolie_getty698490282.jpg?h=c673cd1c"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/1280_angelina_jolie_getty698490282.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/angelina-jolie-says-she-doesnt-enjoy-being-single-its-not-something-i-wanted-86550", "title": "Angelina Jolie Says She 'Doesn't Enjoy Being Single': 'It's Not Something I Wanted'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/1280_angelina_jolie_getty698490282.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 42-year-old actress told the 'Sunday Telegraph' that she is \"just trying to get through.\"", "title": "Angelina Jolie Says She 'Doesn't Enjoy Being Single': 'It's Not Something I Wanted'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/angelina-jolie-says-she-doesnt-enjoy-being-single-its-not-something-i-wanted-86550", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 42-year-old actress told the 'Sunday Telegraph' that she is \"just trying to get through.\"", "twitter": {"description": "The 42-year-old actress told the 'Sunday Telegraph' that she is \"just trying to get through.\"", "title": "Angelina Jolie Says She 'Doesn't Enjoy Being Single': 'It's Not Something I Wanted'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/angelina-jolie-says-she-doesnt-enjoy-being-single-its-not-something-i-wanted-86550", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/1280_angelina_jolie_getty698490282.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Angelina Jolie Says She 'Doesn't Enjoy Being Single': 'It's Not Something I Wanted' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 42, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
