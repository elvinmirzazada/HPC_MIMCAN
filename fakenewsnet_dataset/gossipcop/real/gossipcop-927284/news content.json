Cardi was very much showing at the time, so Carter relied on tutus that night to hide her curves. As Carter explains, both the Moschino performance outfit, which melded a tutu and a peplum, and the super-voluminous oxblood-colored tulle Christian Siriano dress that she changed into afterward had people guessing whether Cardi was taking fashion risks or trying to hide something. \u201cI feel like we got through it,\u201d says Carter. \u201cToward the end there was a ton of speculation, but I don\u2019t think she wore anything that was like, \u2018Oh, my God, that\u2019s her baby bump right there!\u2019\u201d And while it was a nerve-racking few months, Carter came to revel in it: \u201cThe process leading up to it was stressful, but afterward, I was like, this is kind of fun,\u201d he says. \u201cI have one of the biggest secrets in fashion and music, and in culture more generally, and we\u2019re getting away with this every time. How cool is that?\u201d\n\nThe process also left Carter with a deeper understanding of what it\u2019s like for women in the public eye to try to keep parts of their lives private. \u201cWhen it was just a rumor, to see her being criticized online with people saying things like, \u2018You\u2019re stupid. Your career is over. Why would you get pregnant at the peak of your career?\u2019 I was just like, wow, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s fair that people try to make a call on when it is right or wrong for a woman to make a decision in regard to her own body,\u201d Carter says, pointing out that male rappers have children all the time with little fanfare. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine going through that as a woman on a platform that big and remain standing, sticking with my decision. It takes a strong person to stick with that. She should be able to be the biggest artist that she wants to be and also have a family.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/account-avatar.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5acfe4f879a08f0efd0f7228/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/01-cardi-b.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5acfe5106ce06d6cc9d93be4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/02-cardi-b.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6543e140edf87e30cfd741fd/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/654abc07aa83d795b9bcd44d/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/654e40dbe9bdec7dcd681914/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/654e5bffeab698685cbf28c0/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5acfe4c862056e0d048a7605/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-cardi-b.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6565063109ad44759cdd3263/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6564b85fa971373d8d075cd5/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6564aeed6d32738be2f6a2d1/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/us/logo-header.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6509ff2137c195a9087e37cc/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/655cbed9ade75c203b2064a8/4:3/pass/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/654d59fc9de2734db2c94616/master/h_120%2Cc_limit/00-DECEMBER-ISSUE.png"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5acfe4c862056e0d048a7605/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-cardi-b.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Rachel Hahn"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/cardi-b-pregnant-kollin-carter-stylist-baby-bump-reveal-conceal", "title": "How Cardi B and Stylist Kollin Carter Hid That Baby Bump", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "While the art of dressing a baby bump is tricky for anyone, it\u2019s entirely different for someone like Cardi B.", "id": "5acfe3ec62056e0d048a7603", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5acfe3ec62056e0d048a7603", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"While the art of dressing a baby bump is tricky for anyone, it\u2019s entirely different for someone like Cardi B.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5acfe4c59745dd7870e5a6bb/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-cardi-b.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5acfe4c59745dd7870e5a6bb/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-cardi-b.jpg\"}", "og": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5acfe4c862056e0d048a7605/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-cardi-b.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "How Cardi B and Stylist Kollin Carter Hid That Baby Bump", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/cardi-b-pregnant-kollin-carter-stylist-baby-bump-reveal-conceal"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-04-12T23:09:35.816Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-13T01:08:00.000Z", "author": "Rachel Hahn"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5acfe4c862056e0d048a7605/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-cardi-b.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "How Cardi B and Stylist Kollin Carter Hid That Baby Bump"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5acfe4c862056e0d048a7605/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/00-social-cardi-b.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523574575.816, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
