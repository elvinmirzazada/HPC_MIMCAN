The image in question, which shows the \u201cSorry Not Sorry\u201d singer out on the town with old Disney Channel friends, first surfaced on a fan Instagram account for the pop star Hayley Kiyoko.\n\nIn a comment first noticed by Buzzfeed, one follower called out the glass that Lovato holds in her right hand. The glass was apparently shaded out when the photo was shared by her other friends who accompanied her in the picture.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not tryna question Demi\u2019s sobriety bc I have a lot of respect for her,\u201d the commenter says in part. \u201cIt just seems weird that her best friends post this pic with it shaded and then Hayley who isn\u2019t rlly that close to Demi posts the one where you can see what she\u2019s holding?? Like tf is going on.\u201d\n\nLovato noticed the comment and posted one of her own, making it clear that she resented that implication that she had broken her sobriety. \u201cI don\u2019t have to defend anything but it was Red Bull,\u201d she fired back.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

It IS possible. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u201d\n\nThe news came months after the release of her acclaimed documentary Simply Complicated, in which she chronicled the daily struggles she experiences with her recovery. The candid film even began with Lovato admitting she was using cocaine for the majority of filming for her 2012 documentary Stay Strong.\n\n\u201cI was so honest in that documentary but I wasn\u2019t honest enough. And I think it was because I wasn\u2019t honest with myself,\u201d Lovato told PEOPLE in October. \u201cYes, I did touch on issues and certain things that were real and true but I think the biggest problem was I was lying to myself. And in this documentary, I\u2019m 1000 percent sober and I get to really explain myself and apologize to my fans. There wasn\u2019t anything that was off-limits.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something I definitely feel relief from,\u201d she added. \u201cBeing so honest and open and talking about subjects that I never talked about before is a big part of why I feel relieved \u2026 I feel like I got to really speak my truth.\u201d", "images":
