While the episode, titled \u201cThe Wedding,\u201d will feature some upbeat moments as Kate Pearson (Chrissy Metz) gets ready to marry her longtime love Toby (Chris Sullivan), emotions will run high as she walks down the aisle without her dearly departed dad (Milo Ventimiglia) by her side.\n\nBut now, promos for \u201cThe Wedding\u201d episode confirm that Jack will be back for his little girl\u2019s big day. The teaser for the This Is Us season 2 finale shows Jack Pearson in the present day, sporting gray hair, a salt-and-pepper goatee, and wire-rimmed glasses as he touches his wife Rebecca\u2019s (Mandy Moore) face and says, \u201cWhere\u2019d the time go, Bec?\u201d\n\nThis Is Us fans (and pretty much the rest of the universe) know that Jack Pearson died on Super Bowl Sunday in 1998 when he was 53 years old. The Pearson patriarch saved the family dog (and a pillowcase full of family belongings!) after a house fire, but he couldn\u2019t save himself. Complications from smoke inhalation did Papa Pearson in, and now Kate\u2019s wedding marks 20 years since his tragic passing.\n\nThe trailer for \u201cThe Wedding\u201d features a flashback of a younger Jack telling 10-year-old Kate (Mackenzie Hancsicsak): \u201cThe guy that gets to marry you, Katey girl, he is one lucky guy.\u201d Later, we see adult Kate flanked by her brothers Kevin and Randall (Justin Hartley, Sterling K. Brown) as she walks down the aisle. The promo teases a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at Kate and Toby\u2019s wedding and that\u2019s when old man Jack is seen.\n\nWhile Milo Ventimiglia\u2019s appearance as a 70-something Jack Pearson is likely a dream, This Is Us fans may recall last season when Randall had a hallucination and saw Jack standing on a ladder at the family cabin. The cabin is also the setting for Kate\u2019s wedding.\n\nThis won\u2019t be the first time This Is Us has introduced an older version of a character that fell outside of the timelines the NBC drama usually focuses on. During the post-Super Bowl episode, 37-year-old Randall was shown in the future as a man in this 50s. At the time, This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman teased the alternate timeline to Deadline, saying, \u201cWe show a new timeline, in the future, which is extremely exciting for a show that plays in time and has till-now played in the past/present. But there is other stuff coming, too\u2026there is a plan for the show, there always has been, we aren\u2019t just shooting from the hip.\u201d Fogelman has said the future may play a big part in This Is Us seasons to come.\n\n'This Is Us': Jack Pearson Is Old, Grey and Not Dead in Season 2 Finale Promo (Video)@NBCThisIsUs #ThisIsUs https://t.co/lGIseonNAg pic.twitter.com/uVgFYNq8sL \u2014 TheWrap (@TheWrap) March 7, 2018\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, This Is Us star Susan Kelechi Watson, who plays Randall\u2019s wife Beth Pearson on the show, said \u201cThe Wedding\u201d episode will be a special one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Kelechi Watson said. \u201cIt felt like the natural way for this season to end. We built to this moment, so it feels very natural \u2014 this is what\u2019s coming next, the wedding. But yet, even in the midst of all that, life for the Pearsons for each individual is still happening. So everybody is still dealing with their own stuff, but now we get to celebrate at this family event that we\u2019ve been anticipating and feel good about. After a hard year \u2014 I mean, this was a rough one for the family, going through Jack\u2019s death and the fire, and for slow-cookers\u2014 it\u2019s a really beautiful way to celebrate.\u201d\n\nThe This Is Us season 2 finale airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.", "images": ["https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/inquisitr_cross.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v3/assets/search-icon.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Victoria Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4816599/this-is-us-see-milo-ventimiglia-play-jack-pearson-as-an-old-man-in-season-2-finale", "title": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019: See Milo Ventimiglia Play Jack Pearson As An Old Man In Season 2 Finale", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "This Is Us is toying with an alternate timeline in the Season 2 finale\u2014and it&#8217;s not via a flashback or a flash forward.
