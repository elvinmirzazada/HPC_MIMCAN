The film\u2019s writer J.K. Rowling, director David Yates, and studio Warner Bros. have all issued statements defending the casting. Some fans have been supportive of Depp\u2019s involvement, while others are rather outraged.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very hard thing for me,\u201d Radcliffe said, noting he wants to be supportive of the film\u2019s producers who \u201cgave me a great start in life and an amazing job.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cI can see why people are frustrated with the response that they were given from that \u2026 I\u2019m not saying anything that anybody hasn\u2019t already said \u2014 and this is a weird analogy to draw \u2014 [but] in the NFL, there are lots of players arrested for smoking weed and there is other people\u2019s behavior that goes way beyond that and it\u2019s tolerated because they\u2019re very famous players. I suppose the thing I was struck by was, we did have a guy who was reprimanded for weed on the [original Potter] film, essentially, so obviously what Johnny has been accused of is much greater than that.\u201d\n\nRadcliffe is referring to actor Jamie Waylett, who played Hogwarts bully Vincent Crabbe. After appearing in six Harry Potter films, Waylett was dropped from the two-part adaptation of Deathly Hallows after being arrested for growing 10 marijuana plants in 2009. Waylett being dropped for his pot offense is sometimes referenced by fans who protest Depp\u2019s casting. The actor was a virtual unknown when he was axed from the Potter franchise and \u2014 unlike Depp \u2014 was arrested and pleaded guilty to growing pot plants in his mother\u2019s home. Waylett was later arrested for packing a homemade bomb during the 2011 London riots.\n\nRadcliffe next stars in the upcoming TBS anthology series Miracle Workers, an office comedy set in heaven.\n\nDepp\u2019s titular casting in The Crimes of Grindelwald has been a divisive flashpoint issue for the sequel due to his ex-wife Amber Heard\u2019s claim he emotionally and physically abused her during their whirlwind marriage. The couple released a joint statement after their divorce was finalized in 2016. \u201cOur relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm. Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future. Amber will be donating financial proceeds from the divorce to a charity,\u201d they said.\n\nRowling weighed in with a defense of keeping Depp on the film, writing, \u201cBased on our understanding of the circumstances, the filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies.\u201d\n\nStudio Warner Bros. also released a statement, noting, \u201cWe are of course aware of reports that surfaced around the end of Johnny Depp\u2019s marriage, and take seriously the complexity of the issues involved. This matter has been jointly addressed by both parties, in a statement in which they said \u2018there was never any intent of physical or emotional harm.\u2019 Based on the circumstances and the information available to us, we, along with the filmmakers, continue to support the decision to proceed with Johnny Depp in the role of Grindelwald in this and future films.\u201d\n\nThe Crimes of Grindelwald will be released Nov. 16.\n\nRadcliffe spoke to EW while promoting Miracle Workers at the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour in Pasadena. He noted that he signed on to the project because he wanted to get rich \u2014 Simon Rich, the Man Seeking Woman creator. \u201cIt\u2019s Simon\u2019s writing and the fact that it\u2019s going to be an anthology series,\u201d explains Radcliffe. \u201cEssentially, I\u2019m getting the chance to ride on his coattails for three years. He\u2019s one of the best writers around. As an actor, to have an opportunity to have a writer of that caliber say, \u2018We\u2019re going to work on a new story every year and find a new character to play every year for the next few years,\u2019 that\u2019s just a bit of a dream, really.\u201d", "images":
