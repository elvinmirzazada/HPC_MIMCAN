By 1958, the magazine's annual profit was $4 million and \"Hef\" had skyrocketed to fame.\n\nThe magazine's monthly circulation peaked at 7 million issues in 1971. By that time, nearly one-quarter of all American college men were buying or subscribing every month, according to the New Yorker. But by the 1980s the franchise was struggling.\n\nHefner's public profile surged once again in the early 2000s with the release of his reality television show on E! The program, titled \"The Girls Next Door,\" depicted the lives of his three blonde girlfriends at the Playboy Mansion and ran from 2005 to 2010.\n\nLast year, that mansion, dubbed the ultimate bachelor pad, sold for $100 million, half of Hefner's original asking price of $200 million. It was still the most expensive home ever sold in Los Angeles, and the icon was allowed to live there until his passing.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-9eJ8k4iSzux46.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/03/16/103474687-4ED1-REQ-HOWIMADEIT-GUZMAN-031616.600x400.jpg?v=1458141912", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/09/28/104738553-5ED1-REQ-HughHefner--092817.600x400.jpg?v=1506622309", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/styles/skin/sections/make-it/logos/cnbc-logo-gray-2x.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/styles/skin/sections/make-it/logos/Make-It-Logo-2X.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/01/18/103312672-GettyImages-473333000.600x400.jpg?v=1453125970", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/28/hugh-hefner-used-600-to-start-the-110-million-playboy-empire.html", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/09/28/104738546-RTR2GT4U.1910x1000.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/12/03/103214886-playboy.600x400.jpg?v=1449164246", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/staticcontent/img/playerAssets/social-icon-share-2x.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://sc.cnbcfm.com/applications/cnbc.com/staticcontent/img/loader-2.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/09/28/104738546-RTR2GT4U.1910x1000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ruth Umoh", "Source"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/28/hugh-hefner-used-600-to-start-the-110-million-playboy-empire.html", "title": "How Hugh Hefner started with $600 and created the $110 million Playboy empire", "meta_data": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "pageNodeId": 104738255, "description": "Lifestyle icon Hugh Hefner founded Playboy magazine after getting turned down for a $5 raise.", "keywords": "Make It - Money, Make It, business news", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/28/hugh-hefner-used-600-to-start-the-110-million-playboy-empire.html", "site_name": "CNBC", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/09/28/104738546-RTR2GT4U.1910x1000.jpg", "title": "How Hugh Hefner started with $600 and created the $110 million Playboy empire", "description": "Hef founded \"Playboy\" after getting turned down for a $5 raise."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNBC", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170928191316im_/https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/28/hugh-hefner-used-600-to-start-the-110-million-playboy-empire.html", "creator": "@ruthumohnews", "title": "How Hugh Hefner started with $600 and created the $110 million Playboy empire", "description": "Hef founded \"Playboy\" after getting turned down for a $5 raise.", "image": {"src": "https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/09/28/104738546-RTR2GT4U.1910x1000.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2017-09-28T13:00:20-0400", "modified_time": "2017-09-28T14:45:07-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Make It - Money", "tag": "Make It"}, "author": "Ruth Umoh", "news_keywords": "hugh hefner, playboy, playboy net worth, hugh hefner net worth,", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "tp": {"PreferredRuntimes": "universal", "PreferredFormats": "M3U,MPEG4", "initialize": "false"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "referrer": "unsafe-url"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506546000.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
