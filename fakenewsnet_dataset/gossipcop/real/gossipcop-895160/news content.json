The reason that led me to file for divorce from Ms. Downs was thoroughly understood by all parties as well. Infidelity was not a reason, nor did I ever admit such a thing. Thank you to those of you who have shown support throughout this tough time.\u201d\n\nDowns had alleged in her tweet earlier in the month that a woman had called her to say she was sleeping with her husband, and that it was the same woman Duhon had called during their honeymoon.\n\nBut Downs, 31, wouldn\u2019t let him have the last word. She shared her side of the story in a lengthy Instagram post on Sunday evening: \u201cI see that instead of finally operating in integrity, [Nate] chose to continue to lie. My husband & I had problems. Yes. He was dishonest and there were women throughout our ENTIRE marriage. Admittedly, I didn\u2019t know how to handle that; and as you saw on the show, I handled it poorly at times. I\u2019m not proud of that, but I am extremely proud of the woman who acknowledges that and has made a conscious effort to change the things I didn\u2019t like. When I got married, I meant FOREVER.\u201d\n\nInstead of finally accepting accountability, Nate has chosen to play this out in the media. Again, the best part about the truth is that it will stand the test of time A post shared by Sheila Latrice (@happyfromwithin) on Nov 19, 2017 at 4:34pm PST\n\nShe went on to elaborate on Duhon\u2019s alleged mistresses and claims he never stopped living the single life.\n\nThank You!

I\u2019m many things, but I am NOT a liar. I stayed in my marriage BC of my COVENANT WITH GOD. Nate cried & told me he wasn\u2019t ready & I deserved better almost a year ago. I should\u2019ve let him go then & for real the worst thing you can say is that we had 4 counselors?? That is correct we went to 1 ONCE who just wasn\u2019t a fit, 1 was a hardcore fan of the show (kinda a problem), one was nice as can be but a space cadet, & then we found the one! Neeeext!\u201d\n\nThe two had faced many challenges throughout the show, including trust issues and family disputes, but ultimately attempted to give their marriage a chance. Downs brought up her trust issues in the June 8 episode of MAFS and on the July 13 episode she moved out of the home they shared after a blowout fight where she insisted she was ending their marriage. However, during the August 3 show, Duhon insisted, \u201cMarriage is work. We understand that. We are still married.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Promo-2350-Us-Weekly-Jennifer-Garner-Feature.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1583px%2C896px&resize=600%2C338&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/a360media-logo-color.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AmazonIsh.png?crop=35px%2C0px%2C1281px%2C1281px&resize=300%2C300&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/married-at-first-sights-nate-duhon-sheila-downs-split/", "title": "Married at First Sight\u2019s Nate Duhon, Sheila Downs Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "ahrefs-site-verification": "0c593552a61f5d2f07d12f3629456cc24366510fb83bd76eb9504919faac5af7", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "After Married at First Sight\u2019s Sheila Downs claimed Nate Duhon was unfaithful, the couple announced on Sunday, November 19, they have split \u2013 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Married at First Sight\u2019s Nate Duhon, Sheila Downs Split", "description": "After Married at First Sight\u2019s Sheila Downs claimed Nate Duhon was unfaithful, the couple announced on Sunday, November 19, they have split \u2013 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/married-at-first-sights-nate-duhon-sheila-downs-split/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-11-21T00:04:09+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-11-21T00:04:09+00:00"}, "author": "Jessica Vacco-Bolanos", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Married at First Sight\u2019s Nate Duhon and Sheila Downs Split", "description": "After Married at First Sight\u2019s Sheila Downs claimed Nate Duhon was unfaithful, the couple announced on Sunday, November 19, they have split \u2013 details", "image": "/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.3.2", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-20 19:04:09", "sailthru.title": "Married at First Sight\u2019s Nate Duhon and Sheila Downs Have Split: \u2018I Have Already Filed for Divorce\u2019", "sailthru.tags": ",Celebrity News,celebrity relationships,divorce,divorce,family,family and relationships,marriage,pop culture,society", "sailthru.author": "Jessica Vacco-Bolanos", "sailthru.description": "Married at First Sight\u2019s Nate Duhon and Sheila Downs have split \u2013 and it may not be amicable.
