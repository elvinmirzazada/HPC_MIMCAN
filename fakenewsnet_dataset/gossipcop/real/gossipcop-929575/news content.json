Levine even balanced a life-sized cardboard cutout of Corden on his chin, which led to an obvious joke or two.\n\nLater, at the track, the fellas traded in Corden\u2019s white Range Rover for a Porsche SUV. Somehow, Corden set the best race time of the day. We didn\u2019t see that coming.\n\nWatch the video above.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/leo.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Adam-Levine-James-Corden-Carpool-Karaoke.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/val-c-xochitl-gomez-dwts.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Black-Cake-Pearl-Covey.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tony-Maglio.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tony-Maglio.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/jeff-grossman-amy-kuessner.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Adam-Levine-James-Corden-Carpool-Karaoke.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tony Maglio", "Sharon Knolle", "Dessi Gomez", "Adam Chitwood", "Loree Seitz", "Tv Editor", "Tony.Maglio Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/adam-levine-james-corden-carpool-karaoke-pulled-over-cops/", "title": "Adam Levine, James Corden Get Pulled Over by Cops During \u2018Carpool Karaoke\u2019 (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Adam Levine, James Corden Get Pulled Over by Cops During 'Carpool Karaoke' (Video) - TheWrap", "description": "\"The Voice\" mentor and \"Late Late Show\" host are \"two cool dads\"", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/adam-levine-james-corden-carpool-karaoke-pulled-over-cops/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Adam-Levine-James-Corden-Carpool-Karaoke.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-05-25T14:10:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-25T14:42:39+00:00"}, "author": "Tony Maglio", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Tony Maglio", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Adam Levine, James Corden Get Pulled Over by Cops During \u2018Carpool Karaoke\u2019 (Video)", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/adam-levine-james-corden-carpool-karaoke-pulled-over-cops/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-05-25T07:10:44-07:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Tony Maglio", "parsely-tags": "adam_levine, carpool-karaoke, cbs, james-corden, los_angeles, maroon_5, range-rover", "article-tags": "adam_levine, carpool-karaoke, cbs, james-corden, los_angeles, maroon_5, range-rover}", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "music, tv, videos", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527257444.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
