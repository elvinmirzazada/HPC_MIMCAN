The actor recalled how he pushed his now 16-year-old daughter to continue her musical tour even though she insisted on going home.\n\n\"We came downstairs and she had shaved her head bald,\" he said. \"She shaved her head bald in the middle of her \"Whip My Hair\" tour. I was like, 'Oh, s***.\"\n\nValerie Macon/Getty\n\n\"I'm looking at that girl and I'm like, 'Got it. I understand. You will not have this trouble out of me ever again. Let's go, baby. We can go,'\" he continued. \"For me, it was that soldier that was pushing and wasn't paying any attention whatsoever to what was going on emotionally with this beautiful little creature in front of me. That was the first part of the collapsing of my father's suit that I was wearing that wasn't mine.\"\n\nRELATED: Will and Willow Smith Share an Adorable Father-Daughter Moment at Chanel's Fall Couture
