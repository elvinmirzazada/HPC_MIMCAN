Just ask Sophie Turner, the actress who\u2019s played the tactical Sansa Stark since the beginning. In early June, the actress commemorated the show, which is nearly done shooting its final season, by getting a tattoo of a direwolf along with the message \u201cthe pack survives.\u201d It\u2019s clearly meant to be an ode to family and all things House Stark\u2014but, of course, once they saw it, fans worried that she was somehow giving away the ending of the show.\n\nBut why would she do that? Of course, Turner didn\u2019t spoil anything. The actress stopped by James Corden\u2019s Late Late Show to explain that she was well aware that people might misconstrue the new ink, to the point where friends warned her not to get it.\n\n\u201cWhen I was getting it done, people advised me not to because it looked like I was giving it away. But I wasn\u2019t!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a quote from last season, but everyone figures that the pack really does survive.\u201d\n\nReally, the quote is \u201cjust a moral that I like to live by,\u201d Turner explained. Just a moral, folks! Just a nice saying. Plus, if you really think that sadist George R.R. Martin is letting this series end without some serious pack division, then perhaps you\u2019ve been watching a different show. Last season may have been surprisingly low on favorite character deaths, but that might have been so HBO can wallop its viewers into Red Wedding flashbacks when Season 8 premieres next year.\n\nGetting a tattoo is just Turner\u2019s way of preparing herself for the end, as many of her other castmates have been doing recently. Emilia Clarke, who plays Daenerys Targaryen, posted a heartfelt message on Instagram this week, thanking the show \u201cfor the life I never dreamed I\u2019d be able to live and the family I\u2019ll never stop missing.\u201d The actress has already shot her final scenes as the Mother of Dragons, telling Vanity Fair in a cover story that viewers are in for a shocking end. \u201cIt fucked me up,\u201d she said. \u201cKnowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone\u2019s mouth of what Daenerys is . . .\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s about all we\u2019re gonna know about the show\u2019s future until Season 8 comes around. As for Turner, she promised Corden that she\u2019ll just go ahead and get finale spoiler details \u201ctattooed on my forehead next time.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6554dc8c30035d74eb12f6cd/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b1af120a84e0e7a3df097fc/1:1/pass/GoT-Prequel-HBO.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655ccc3505c13bc519c0d468/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b2cf35aa84e0e7a3df099c5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sophie-turner-tattoo%20(1).jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654934799c75ababc2151347/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654ba88c57191a17f9610c9d/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660159ee60bb2d438ba5ff/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b047f6c97a2dc739c87c89e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/emilia-clarke-0618-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b09a4de9de824723a523b6f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a-emilia-clarke-image-replacement.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b20694b6cf0c55cfe0c413c/1:1/pass/got-spin.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b27efaa6163e4725653cbaa/1:1/pass/clarke-game-of-thrones-goodbye.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b047f6c10790065de9e2dc0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/emilia-clarke-0618-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/656510d0affa7b4408631071/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6543ef81af9357211c5844fb/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6564cb9e766ac2eb76f98953/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fe7af0987db7065a9e93f4/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65524472fdcd5122e9d20d0c/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b2cf35aa84e0e7a3df099c5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sophie-turner-tattoo%20(1).jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Yohana Desta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/sophie-turner-explains-direwolf-game-of-thrones-tattoo", "title": "No, Sophie Turner\u2019s Game of Thrones Tattoo Didn\u2019t Spoil the End of the Series", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "The actress explains the real meaning behind her \u201cthe pack survives\u201d ink.", "id": "5b2ce044f47a36695449ccc6", "keywords": "game of thrones,sophie turner ,emilia clarke,sansa stark", "news_keywords": "game of thrones,sophie turner ,emilia clarke,sansa stark", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b2ce044f47a36695449ccc6", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The actress explains the real meaning behind her \u201cthe pack survives\u201d ink.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b2cf35aa84e0e7a3df099c5/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/sophie-turner-tattoo%20(1).jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b2cf35aa84e0e7a3df099c5/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/sophie-turner-tattoo%20(1).jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The actress explains the real meaning behind her \u201cthe pack survives\u201d ink.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b2cf35aa84e0e7a3df099c5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sophie-turner-tattoo%20(1).jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "No, Sophie Turner\u2019s Game of Thrones Tattoo Didn\u2019t Spoil the End of the Series", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/sophie-turner-explains-direwolf-game-of-thrones-tattoo"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-06-22T13:02:50.228Z", "modified_time": "2018-06-22T13:02:50.228Z", "author": "Yohana Desta"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The actress explains the real meaning behind her \u201cthe pack survives\u201d ink.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b2cf35aa84e0e7a3df099c5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sophie-turner-tattoo%20(1).jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "No, Sophie Turner\u2019s Game of Thrones Tattoo Didn\u2019t Spoil the End of the Series"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b2cf35aa84e0e7a3df099c5/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/sophie-turner-tattoo%20(1).jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dOw_fs7JwaA"], "publish_date": 1529672570.228, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
