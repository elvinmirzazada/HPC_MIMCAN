Where the number of admissions is unknown, they are estimated by dividing the nominal gross by the average ticket price in the year of release to provide an estimate (taking re-releases into account).[8] Admissions better reflect the popularity of older films, since they are less susceptible to the effects of inflation.\n\nMany of the films on this list were released prior to the availability of home video and have had multiple releases.\n\n\u2020 Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 24 November 2023 in theaters around the world.\n\nTNot including figures from 2023 releases.\n\nFactors in determining \"adjusted gross\" [ edit ]\n\nNo one yet has calculated a truly precise and definite referential adjusted gross for a film,[original research?] since doing so would have to take into account most (or all) of the following:\n\nBox office gross on initial release\n\nrelease Ticket price at time of release, or its relative price to other commodities in a given year, [10] in relation to general inflation and gross domestic product.
