From 2011 to 2013, the first two series aired on British network Channel 4, as did the special \"White Christmas\" (2014); the following four series were released on the American streaming platform Netflix from 2016 to 2023. There are twenty-seven episodes in the show's first six series, and an additional interactive film Bandersnatch (2019).[1] Inspired by The Twilight Zone, each episode of Black Mirror is standalone and explores the common theme of technology and its side-effects.[2]\n\nBlack Mirror has received positive reception from critics[a] and has been nominated for eighty-six awards, winning twenty-four of them. The most acclaimed episodes are \"USS Callister\", which won four Emmy Awards, and \"San Junipero\", which won two. Additionally, the interactive film Black Mirror: Bandersnatch won two Emmy Awards. As actors rarely appear in more than one episode, the only people to receive multiple awards for their work on the show are writer Charlie Brooker, who has won seven, and executive producer Annabel Jones, who has won four. The series has been nominated for seventeen British Academy Film Awards, winning two, and fifteen Emmy Awards, winning nine.\n\nStatistics [ edit ]\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nSixteen of the show's twenty-two episodes have received awards or nominations, including those given to specific people for their work on the episode.

This was initially allowed, but it was later entered as Outstanding Drama Series instead.[43][44] Critics for IndieWire disagreed that the series should have been eligible in the category as it is episodic; rule changes have been attributed to Black Mirror's success.[42][45] In 2021, the Limited Series category expanded to include anthology series.[43][40]\n\nEmmy Awards [ edit ]\n\nLetitia Wright, who appeared in series four episode \"Black Museum\" as Nish, was nominated for an Emmy.\n\nInternational Emmy Awards [ edit ]\n\nFangoria Chainsaw Awards [ edit ]\n\nThe Fangoria Chainsaw Awards are given to horror and thriller films.
