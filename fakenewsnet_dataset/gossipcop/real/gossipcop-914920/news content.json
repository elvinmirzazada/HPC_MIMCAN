While fans may be concerned that the SURvers have matured over the years, Tom Sandoval and Tom Schwartz previously assured Us Weekly that the cast of Vanderpump Rules will still bring the drama for season 7. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We still are complete disasters in other aspects of our lives. [\u2026]\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much what he does. That\u2019s his MO. He needs to bring up things that happened years ago because there\u2019s nothing for him to talk about,\u201d Jax Taylor told Us Weekly exclusively when asked about James rapping about the former SUR bartender\u2019s indiscretion with Faith Stowers in front of Jax\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Brittany Cartwright, during the Monday, December 3, episode of Vanderpump Rules. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really have much going on in his life. There\u2019s nothing there. There\u2019s no substance to him. It gets to the point where it\u2019s like, \u2018What else do you got man?\u2019 You\u2019ve got nothing else anymore. We don\u2019t really talk to him much anymore.\u201d\n\nBrittany, who accepted Jax\u2019s proposal in the premiere, noted to Us that she has been \u201cnothing but nice\u201d to James, so he had no reason to embarrass her in front of her colleagues and the guests at SUR.\n\nRelated: Celebrities Obsessed With \u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 Jennifer Lawrence, Rihanna and Kristin Chenoweth are just a few of the celebrities who can\u2019t get enough of Vanderpump Rules. The reality show, which premiered in 2013, follows the lives of Lisa Vanderpump and her SUR employees. Over the years, the SURvers have amassed their own fans, especially OG stars Stassi Schroeder, Jax Taylor, Kristen [\u2026]\n\n\u201cI was crying and, like, ran out,\u201d the Kentucky native explained. \u201cHe tries to say that that was about Jax, but Jax wasn\u2019t there. I was the one that was there, I was the one that was embarrassed in front of the entire crowd, not Jax. So him trying to be like, \u2018That was about Jax,\u2019 that doesn\u2019t make sense. That\u2019s no ground to stand on because I was the one who got hurt that day.\u201d\n\nEven Lala Kent, who used to be the DJ\u2019s only ally on the Bravo series, is no longer friends with James after he went after her close friends and fianc\u00e9 Randall Emmett.\n\n\u201cI guess, fortunately, it hasn\u2019t affected my life in a negative way, not being friends with him. So I\u2019m good,\u201d Lala told Us. \u201cHe has always been an extremely verbally abusive friend to me and I always shook it off because I knew that it was coming from a hurt place and I knew it really only happened when he was under the influence. But when you start attacking someone who I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life with, you might as well be attacking my mother as well.\u201d\n\nRelated: Biggest Feuds in Reality TV History Ever since reality TV began, one of the biggest draws has been the drama \u2014 specifically, the fighting that breaks out while the cameras are rolling. Through the years \u2014 from Laguna Beach and The Hills to the Real Housewives and beyond, the claws come out when action is called. Although Lauren Conrad butted heads [\u2026]\n\n\u201cIt was just something that I couldn\u2019t bounce back from,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd now the people that I have in my world like Katie [Maloney], Kristen [Doute], Stassi [Schroeder], a friendship with James would never work because the people in my world don\u2019t care for him. So I\u2019ve moved on.\u201d\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
