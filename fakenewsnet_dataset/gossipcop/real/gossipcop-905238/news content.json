Where my roots were placed, where my mother raised me and my family. Completely under water. I really can't believe it. I am praying and thinking so much for our friends in the hospital and their families that are still missing,\" Bella wrote. \"For our horses, dogs, cats-all animals- that gave us happiness, who are now searching for a dry place to lay their heads.. our elementary school... The freeway to drive to school and where @mini_jk_imbig and I would walk after school.. under water. My heart is broken.... I remember when something similar happened in La Conchita about 12 years ago, so close to us and how much it took to rebuild...\"\n\n\"I can't imagine how Montecito feels now. I am so sorry,\" she continued. \"As always- Please send websites for donations. I'm ready to help. Thank you to the rescue, fire fighters and security teams in SB for staying strong and your hard work to pull out anybody and anything in sight. My love is with you so deeply SB.\"\n\n\"My beautiful hometown, just after getting through weeks of wildfire, has been hit by a major storm. That \u201criver\u201d is the 101 freeway,\" Gigi tweeted. \"Please keep the families of Santa Barbara in your thoughts and prayers.\"\n\nIn December, Rob Lowe invited firefighters responding to the wildfires to his home for dinner.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fbela_gigi_hadid_gettyimages-873804080.jpg%3Fh%3D67672770&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/bela_gigi_hadid_gettyimages-873804080.jpg?h=67672770", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Frob_lowe_gettyimages-866038878.jpg%3Fh%3Db8e3a7ff&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2Fkylie_jenner_gettyimages-671700060.jpg%3Fh%3Dd32be988&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2023-11/MK-Brett-Eldredge-1920-x-800-GALLERY-HERO.jpg?h=1ecad531&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2F1280_somos_una_voz_gettyimages-861451096.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/bela_gigi_hadid_gettyimages-873804080.jpg?h=67672770", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/bella-and-gigi-hadid-share-heartbreaking-pics-their-flooded-california-hometown-93964", "title": "Bella and Gigi Hadid Share Heartbreaking Pics From Their Flooded California Hometown", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/bela_gigi_hadid_gettyimages-873804080.jpg?h=67672770", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The sisters are devastated by the flooding and mudslides in Montecito and Santa Barbara, which struck the area following deadly recent wildfires.", "title": "Bella and Gigi Hadid Share Heartbreaking Pics From Their Flooded California Hometown", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/bella-and-gigi-hadid-share-heartbreaking-pics-their-flooded-california-hometown-93964", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The sisters are devastated by the flooding and mudslides in Montecito and Santa Barbara, which struck the area following deadly recent wildfires.", "twitter": {"description": "The sisters are devastated by the flooding and mudslides in Montecito and Santa Barbara, which struck the area following deadly recent wildfires.", "title": "Bella and Gigi Hadid Share Heartbreaking Pics From Their Flooded California Hometown", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/bella-and-gigi-hadid-share-heartbreaking-pics-their-flooded-california-hometown-93964", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/bela_gigi_hadid_gettyimages-873804080.jpg?h=67672770", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Bella and Gigi Hadid Share Heartbreaking Pics From Their Flooded California Hometown | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Bella Hadid, Gigi Hadid", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
