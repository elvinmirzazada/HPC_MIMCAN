The Real Housewives of Orange County alum officially welcomed her twin boys on June 5, her husband, Jim Edmonds, confirmed in his Instagram Story. They are the second and third kids for Meghan and Jim, joining big sister, Aspen King Edmonds. (They also have four stepsiblings from Jim's previous relationships.)\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of Orange County on Peacock and the Bravo App.\n\nJim shared a photo of his twins' footprints on his arm in his Instagram Story. \"1 little foot each,\" he captioned the photo. \"They made it. Everyone is safe and healthy. Pictures will come soon.\"\n\nMeghan first announced she was expecting back during the RHOC Season 12 reunion in November 2017 and in December she confirmed she was having twins. She also opened up about undergoing IVF again to make her dreams of expanding her family a reality.\n\nJim hinted that Meghan was in labor at the hospital in his Instagram Story.

Photo: @jimedmonds15/Instagram Stories\n\nIn the months leading up to the twins' births, Meghan stepped away from RHOC and her family moved from the West Coast to St. Louis, Missouri. And she certainly kept fans up to date on every moment of her pregnancy as she and her family prepared to go from a family of three to a family of five.\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nShe was also quite candid about how she was preparing to give birth to her two little boys. \"I love knowing my body can handle childbirth; it\u2019s such a beautiful gift to experience a vaginal delivery drug-free. It\u2019s not scary, it\u2019s exhilarating! It\u2019s badass! It\u2019s spiritual! It hurts like hell but I can handle it! And I\u2019m looking forward to each mind-blowing contraction because out comes two babies at the end. I do hope it\u2019s quick and relatively easy but if not, I can handle that, because I have before. I\u2019ve prepped my body by treating it like a temple through nourishment, I\u2019ve prepped my mind by breathing and meditating, I\u2019ve prepped my spirit by praying: I\u2019ve got this. Let\u2019s do it.\"\n\nSee more Meghan, below.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/sutton-stracke.jpg?itok=hhQduioE",
