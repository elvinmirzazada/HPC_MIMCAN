Sherald's painting of Michelle Obama shows her sitting with one hand under her chin and the other draped across her lap, while wearing a long flowing dress decorated with geometric shapes.\n\nObama, the first African-American U.S. president, complimented Sherald for her portrait of Michelle.\n\n\"I want to thank you for so spectacularly capturing the grace and beauty and intelligence and charm and hotness of the woman that I love,\" Obama said.\n\nHe quipped that Wiley, who painted his portrait, was at a disadvantage because his subject was \"less becoming.\"\n\n[1/8]Former U.S. President Barack Obama speaks during an unveiling ceremony for portraits of himself and former First Lady Michelle Obama at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, U.S., February 12, 2018.

Bush. Other portraits were acquired as gifts, bought at auctions or through other means.\n\nReporting by Ayesha Rascoe and Roberta Rampton; Additional reporting by Barbara Goldberg; Editing by Kieran
