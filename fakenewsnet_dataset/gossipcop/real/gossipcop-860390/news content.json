Thank you for your support!\n\n\ud83d\udc9a\n\n\ud83d\udc9a\n\n\ud83d\udc9a #TeamGrimmie #CGforever.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Christina Grimmie to Posthumously Release Four New Music Videos\n\nOn June 10, 2016, Grimmie was shot after performing as the opening act for Before You Exit at The Plaza Live venue near downtown Orlando. Grimmie\u2019s brother Marcus heroically tackled her assailant Kevin James Loibl to the ground, before the latter turned the gun on himself.\n\nThe Grimmie family\u2019s heartfelt message to The Voice alum\u2019s dedicated fan base comes the day after a memorial gathering outside The Plaza Live, where the Orlando Sentinel reports more than two dozen fans came together \u2014 many outfitted in her favorite color, green \u2014 to pay tribute to the slain singer by lighting candles, laying flowers and singing some of her songs.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s hard to be back here,\u201d said Danielle Hendrix, 23, who was in attendance at Grimmie\u2019s final show. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bittersweet because since she was killed here, many of us feel closer to her at The Plaza.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: The Deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds Hit Hollywood Hard\n\n\u201cThere was so much that happened after Christina\u2019s death that I think her story really got swept to the side,\u201d 18-year-old Reese Elmstedt told the Sentinel \u2014 likely referring to the Pulse nightclub shooting, which took place the same weekend on June 12, 2016.\n\n\u201cWe will always remember her, her music and her legacy,\u201d Elmstedt added to the Sentinel of Grimmie. \u201cWe miss her so much.\u201d\n\nIn February, Grimmie\u2019s family donated proceeds from the purchase of Christina\u2019s posthumous single \u201cInvisible\u201d to establish a memorial fund in her name. They released the rest of the album, All Is Vanity, this past Friday.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/HMKLk7556HGekDdKRJJLK4E9NUg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x299:961x301)/stephen-twitch-boss-mom-121622-1-395c28153844417eaa273d11cb0f74ac.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZJIlwgdtzpmfl0NZjMG1-d8HMxM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x309:751x311)/Atiana-De-La-Hoya_01-fac9074b0ef147199513eaefc794de7c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/kn_GAHk8jxS0zEBMH6fkjn7Awsg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x545:921x547)/David-Crosby-People-01-011923-7b8d9b52f25f442aa7dc66116cd9aebf.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/d7vJfYrUColELOg4U6OSaStiDTI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Rocky-Votolato-1-090522-13d06c4e29e94397923b32477bc5b86d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/aHIxVvdAmXA0XixZ9jv7E2hIF9Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/christina-grimmie-1333x2000-f8920dc0eb0b4a1c995f9728785ab755.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/cVdj5R5wq8Lxi2QaVYuEFjxoaV0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/priscilla-presley-lisa-marie-presley-graceland-presents-elvis-the-exhibition-012423-1-1c368d89ad3240318564564c921c3284.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/t5rJrdYzROT-UL6z2c03qX-It-A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(7x0:9x2)/1f49a-c8340e72d52444c8bbbd1acc5d7d5649.png", "https://people.com/thmb/dlnpotFa4s-O0hmtqpdSatirP1o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/priscilla-presley-governors-awards-012423-1-25cb43a5b6e149f09e1511d59622ccb2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4e7SvHiGiRCS7Sjg8L-eq3qvg6I=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x389:736x391)/B-Smyth-01-111722-613ca53c0f5b48a4af3286919a6e8bb5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Q8oUeS0dHUZzvQ8eCW7JekFbKzk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(479x359:481x361)/Jeremy-Renner-Recovery-Wishes-01-010323-939f63e4b094400980097f3808cbb10f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2fNcNqB49ZLbPf6aEFR27IMlDeM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(644x39:646x41)/baz-luhrmann-lisa-marie-presley-011323-1-c2d67f71c3cf41a9830f696735287b9b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/37qA3oaJ6_KGTxV3WBSVCNkTtUg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x29:721x31)/Joel-Weinshanker-Says-Lisa-Marie-Presley-Was-Always-Trying-to-Do-the-Best-for-Elvis-020123-1-b6e40c2e7bfb4f4d97381a95905ca809.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Ra1fzpsQ_c7DNXrAkRcQ-tjqKdc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/ed-sheeran-rolling-stone-032123-6-bb4286a83d56458a93acdd0a21f4e4a3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Hs0sUp1_uV6w3DMjevUsnVzAfTU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(839x269:841x271)/David-Crosby-Children-04-011923-8200aad397f04da0993e752cd11dde0d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/MD408C0TjN0PW8uhGDTE9yG_3vg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x59:1001x61)/kardashians-2000-439fbffdcc464aa6a8f0bd2174d58e13.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4v5HjJUWYMn49JcBT18bmIWZ8q8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x239:706x241)/elvis-presley-120222-7ebadd8ffb2649f1ad33c97efa5a1b8b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ud3s3hFOKxL-ryI7sKub_C2b4yo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x419:961x421)/whitney-houston-1-c8850e3e4810413f82a9c5db6137eb2f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1hsyhE4n6DWuJdiel-37zp58RKo=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/149868831_10111882175526842_8102551053908574099_n-f1e17ac989de4316b1daf2f6d4898aea.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/aHIxVvdAmXA0XixZ9jv7E2hIF9Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/christina-grimmie-1333x2000-f8920dc0eb0b4a1c995f9728785ab755.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jen Juneau", "Jen Juneau Is A News", "Movies Staff Writer At People.
