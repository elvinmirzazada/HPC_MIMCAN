What does that even mean? It just means, like, \u2018F\u2013k me, Drake!\u2019\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the 7-minute interview Bynes expressed her desire to return to acting after her short break from the limelight. \u201cI do miss acting, and I have something surprising to tell you: I\u2019m going to start acting again,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to do TV. Maybe a few guest spots on some shows that I\u2019m a fan of and maybe another TV show where I\u2019m the star of it, in the future. That\u2019s what I hope.\u201d\n\nThe former Nickelodeon star also said that she\u2019s been sober for three years. In 2014, Bynes was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence. She had previously been booked for hitting a police car in 2012, and entered rehab the following year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been going to school lately, fashion school-FIDM. And I love it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned how to sew, I\u2019ve made patterns, and I want to start a clothing line in the future, so FIDM has been helping me with that. Other than that I hike, I go spinning \u2014 I take spinning classes \u2014 and I feed the homeless. And that\u2019s been really interesting and fun.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sam-Altman-ChatGPT-OpenAI.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Reid-Nakamura.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Reid-Nakamura.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drake-Amanda-Bynes.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Macys-Parade-Fails.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Taylor-Swift-Rep-Eras.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sean-combs.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drake-Amanda-Bynes.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reid Nakamura", "Ross A.
