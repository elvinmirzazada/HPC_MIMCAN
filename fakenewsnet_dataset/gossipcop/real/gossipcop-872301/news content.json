It intends to launch the service in 2019.\n\nThe move is a real blow to Netflix, which secured a valuable streaming deal with Disney back in 2012 \u2014 before streaming had really taken off. The deal only kicked into effect last year, so Netflix is barely seeing any benefit here.\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s a natural step for Disney, which has a huge library of valuable movies and shows offer. Disney already makes it hard to get a lot of its top movies \u2014 requiring people to purchase, rather than rent, a film for instance \u2014 so it makes sense that we\u2019re seeing the company look for a way to draw bigger profits from streaming.\n\nIt sounds like Netflix won\u2019t lose the Disney movies it already has. Disney says it plans to cut Netflix off starting with the studio\u2019s 2019 films. That means Netflix should get the next two Star Wars movies, but it\u2019ll miss out on the new trilogy\u2019s final installment. Netflix didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDisney\u2019s streaming service will be built off technology from BAMTech, the MLB-founded video streaming platform. Disney was already a major investor in BAMTech, and today it\u2019s making an even bigger investment \u2014 of $1.58 billion \u2014 giving it a 75 percent stake in the company.\n\nOn top of a Disney streaming service, the company will also launch a streaming service exclusively for ESPN. The company is promising about \u201c10,000 live regional, national, and international games and events a year,\u201d with individual sports packages available as well.\n\nESPN has increasingly been a point of concern for Disney. The channel is expensive, which has led consumers and cable providers to look for ways to drop it from their package or otherwise cut costs. Being able to sell it straight to consumers lets Disney tap into the market of cord cutters who have been missing out on sporting events, while potentially increasing the amount of money it makes per subscriber.\n\nThe Disney-branded streaming service will be the \u201cexclusive home in the US for subscription-video-on-demand viewing,\u201d and will kick off with films including Toy Story 4 and the sequel to Frozen. \u201cOriginal movies, TV shows, [and] short-form content\u201d will be added to the service, and it\u2019ll be filled out with older movies from Disney and Pixar\u2019s catalog and shows from Disney\u2019s TV channels.\n\nDeveloping...", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170808203742im_/https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i3BDei9WvPme-uAikxt6P9adJJg=/0x312:3000x2000/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56110197/483168600.0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808203742im_/https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56109309/mazda-mx-5-rf-targa-0015.0.0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808203742im_/https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56108491/paul_lepage_facebook_maine.0.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808203742im_/https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56107807/2ae97aa620c23098a02cce30cfcdd47d222f32006d79a3c15657ae7f14159c967c85c01aadf381571d06c6da6d9feb98_2040.0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808203742im_/https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56100097/e1shot2.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808203742im_/https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56108415/Screen_Shot_2017_08_08_at_2.30.35_PM.0.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808203742im_/https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00xUCtSk2PBcJOmCdvFgTep3P8E=/0x0:3000x2000/1200x800/filters:focal(1196x997:1676x1477)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56110199/483168600.0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808203742im_/https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56099423/akrales_161313_1330_A_0066.0.1502183125.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808203742im_/https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56108197/8fthhxlf.0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808203742im_/https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56109669/cruise_anywhere_car3.0.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808203742im_/https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i3BDei9WvPme-uAikxt6P9adJJg=/0x312:3000x2000/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56110197/483168600.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aug"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170808203742/https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/8/16115254/disney-launching-streaming-service-ending-netflix-deal", "title": "Disney to end Netflix deal and launch its own streaming service", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "style-tools": "https://www.theverge.com/style/community/372/9ff56050ab730020e4207b0b218e4ccd/tools.css", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/verge", "published_time": "2017-08-08T16:18:44-04:00"}, "author": "Jacob Kastrenakes", "description": "Disney will end its distribution deal with Netflix and launch its own streaming service, the company announced today.
