I\u2019m focused on work right now between TV and film projects,\u201d she said in a statement to PEOPLE Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI found it interesting what Rebel Wilson said in an interview about him and how similar mine was \u2014 it\u2019s showing and telling,\u201d Abraham said about Stay, who was previously linked to actress Rebel Wilson.\n\n\u201cI wish him well, but I\u2019m not rushing into relationships and I like to take my time to do it right for myself and my daughter,\u201d Abraham added. \u201cBeing the best parent I can be is my priority.\n\nShe also shared that she has \u201cmet someone new,\u201d but is keeping her \u201cdating life low-key for now.\u201d\n\nAbraham, who is the single mother of 9-year-old daughter Sophia, told PEOPLE that she was \u201csuper lucky\u201d to be in a relationship with Stay, who has worked on movies like Pitch Perfect 3 and Logan. \u201cWhen you find someone and you have that connection, I think [that] is so rare.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty amazing \u2014 hopefully he will \u2018stay\u2019 around,\u201d she added.\n\nStay also issued a statement to PEOPLE following their split, denying that he dated the reality star for fame or success.\n\n\u201cOur split had nothing to do with success. I have zero desire to be famous. I never even knew she was on a reality TV show that I\u2019ve never even seen, or herd of. No offense to the show. She\u2019s a nice person from what I got to know on the two dates we went on. But that\u2019s as far as it went. I think the whole thing got blown a little out of proportion because of her role on her show,\u201d said Stay.\n\n\u201cI wish her success in what ever ventures she is going to do in the future. But as for me, I\u2019m going to keep being a stuntman and keep making actors look there best,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ll be single till the right woman comes my way. And I know with a little help from the big man up stairs, that day will come. Mahalo for your time.\u201d\n\nStefanie Keenan/Getty; BACKGRID\n\nThe MTV personality previously was linked to her on-again, off-again boyfriend Simon Saran for more than two years, but the pair called it quits in April 2017. Her relationship with Saran was the first to be documented on the show since her high school boyfriend, Derek Underwood, died in a car accident two months before their daughter Sophia was born.\n\n\u201cWhen I met Sophia\u2019s father, it was like love at first sight,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLuckily, I\u2019ve been blessed to work around some great people and met [Aden] and it was kind of like love at first sight again. I honestly felt for a while I didn\u2019t deserve to have an amazing relationship or if that would ever happen,\u201d Abraham said. \u201cSo if I was single for the rest of my life, I was more than prepared to enjoy that journey.\u201d\n\nHer split comes on the heels of her lawsuit against Viacom. After announcing she was \u201cmoving on\u201d from the MTV series in January, blasting the show as \u201chateful\u201d and \u201chorrible,\u201d the reality star is taking legal action, suing parent company Viacom for $5 million.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by The Blast, Abraham claims she was fired because of her decision to work in the adult entertainment industry. The 26-year-old previously released sex tapes with Vivid Entertainment in 2013 and 2014 with porn star James Deen, and since then, she has done adult webcam shows and appearances at strip clubs. She has also endorsed sex toys.\n\n\u201cWe respect Farrah\u2019s decision to pursue other endeavors and we wish her the best,\u201d a Viacom spokesperson told PEOPLE. \u201cRegarding her suit, the claims are without merit.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/cGLCjnDNB-6IdbCpCn9JzGp13rE=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/headshot-d1a12648293f4e51afa323df912ec592.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/J01nFnB6gWTx5KpmfXVukz4Uu68=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x39:736x41)/f-murray-abraham-041723-1-56c873bab94e4db2be39f1b2910cbe51.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/yyOVi7p6utTtsKSqr8s65wxF8FM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x349:706x351)/Rebel-Wilson-Fluid-Dating-App-01-021323-c137e52f7bd54d0d984ff05ac666950d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/LUpcc1KJ5dz8_0Q0_l9yD8eml24=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(572x532:574x534)/farrah-abraham-ab3a114a084e4934a8feee245063af3f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7Bet60k8nvUvsGto_mbc9gDjIDU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(963x386:965x388)/vanderpump-rules-1-bd95d35bea3341259d2eeab345d529a6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rJ53dKmwDNTC5enxA-zKwN8iTqY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(511x0:513x2)/farrah-abraham-6ac6901c1add4acd85f575d33ecbb97a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/JXJ2PxsBKj8DHmxJa69xGEkUToQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(539x207:541x209)/rebel-wilson-daughter-royce-caribbean-getaway-040423-3e42f20de598470f9212c9bc6e3980cc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/d1Cc3HphBz_HOufIKN1pMG4mZ1M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x398:941x400)/farrah-abraham-50567f86ca594203908e637c191a99ef.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/O6oRYhkhvzoh1IOUzcSBMjQ0SwA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x249:736x251)/gwyneth-paltrow-ben-affleck-050323-3-74be527acd024ccdb0af214bf3908b1a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/SzMTB0akgUiTV6QZD3sUZGUZeHM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x419:941x421)/halsey-1-b24339b4bac8461ea07a2b4edd377a68.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/CjQLsqTLDn2COqZsBVvBSQ6zSZQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x179:736x181)/Teen-Mom-Farrah-Abraham-022523-split-55a97f99d90944e0b7177e5235ceba08.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tTG5EVOefOCr8puPE00Owlq5jCo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x479:981x481)/julianne-hough-dating-history-split-d3d3b805cbc94d28a615e6021323b7c9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-Q4CpQQVueSIiROgIfIgtDcd1Q4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(794x109:796x111)/Bill-Hader-c636476fd87843a690a745649a5ec55d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2sTRqVDc2S9HNS-su9Um2gna6QA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(871x214:873x216)/teen-mom-4-faab2ede53d1496eb75aea149c94994f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/w4sdLslf4Dvq7UjbesM71Kle7Rs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x464:981x466)/rachel-bilson-dating-history-split-3fa4a1ae0359497e82159d928e1ca9c7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/aAvxK07mjHJydvL3oGNVt9e1C4s=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x198:961x200)/Rebel-Wilson-Engaged-Ramona-Agruma-021923-03-b3b739a975c84bdc90ef711150b79472.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/70lRo31nF-QdjAAaX5ReSGvyk58=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/farrah-abraham-2-4eceda7abba2469ea67f5a777cbed22a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/eMUlMh2sAPlxn1f6O94k2_QZXDY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x229:721x231)/Rebel-Wilson-and-Ramona-Agruma-01-030823-300d74f654fc4b3193ef82bd730cc3af.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/rJ53dKmwDNTC5enxA-zKwN8iTqY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(511x0:513x2)/farrah-abraham-6ac6901c1add4acd85f575d33ecbb97a.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone", "Brianne Tracy Is A Staff Editor At People.
