I am grateful that long ago we met in a casino when our dreams were big and full of optimism. Life doesn\u2019t always go as planned, but to live is a blessing.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cAnd as they always say, it\u2019s better to have loved and lost then to never have loved at all. Thank you for respecting our privacy at this time.\u201d\n\nAlthough both Reynolds and Volkman\u2019s social media pages have been filled with adorable photos and videos of their children recently, neither have posted about each other on Instagram in over a month.\n\nOn March 13, after staring in Imagine Dragons\u2019 \u201cNext to Me\u201d video as Reynolds\u2019 love interest, Volkman shared a still from the video as the pair shared a sweet kiss.\n\nOne week earlier, Reynolds shared a photograph of his wife, whom he described as his \u201cone and only,\u201d as he wished her a happy birthday.\n\nAfter the birth of their twins last year, the couple told PEOPLE \u201cthese have been the most magical/restless/overwhelming/rewarding hours of our lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more in love with our girls,\u201d the couple added.\n\nReynolds previously opened up to PEOPLE in November about how supportive his wife has been during his battle with ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic inflammatory condition of the joints that can lead to extreme pain and, in the worst cases, spinal fusion.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been completely supportive and patient through the entire process,\u201d said Reynolds. \u201cThere was probably six months of my life where I couldn\u2019t hardly do anything, I couldn\u2019t lift things, and she was just patient through all of it.\u201d",
