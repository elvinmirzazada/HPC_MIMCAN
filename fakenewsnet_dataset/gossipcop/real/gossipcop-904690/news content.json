Women and men alike donned black outfits on the carpet, and wore pins signifying their support of the movement, but for some reason, women seemed to be the only ones asked questions about #TimesUp and gender equality in general \u2014 and people took notice. In an interview with E! News's Giuliana Ransic, actors Darren Criss and Edgar Ram\u00edrez took it upon themselves to bring up why they wore black, and the work they're doing to support gender equality.\n\nAfter being asked what the evening means to them, Edgar brought up the #TimesUp initiative, saying he's proud to be wearing black to support it. While Darren said the reason for wearing black on the red carpet was sort of an \"ominous cloud\" over the evening, he said the show of solidarity is ultimately one of resilience.\n\n\"It's actually kind of a celebration of resilience. I think it's a great representation of our solidarity and our community, that hopefully will reflect positively on the people tuning in.\"\n\nAnd because Edgar pointed out that sexual harassment, misconduct and gender inequality \"is not a women's issue,\" but \"an all genders issue,\" Darren highlighted his support of the United Nations Women's movement, HeForShe.\n\n\"This is a campaign from UN Women called HeForShe. It kind of calls out the boys,\" Darren said. \"There's been a lot of strong, inspiring women who have led the way in voicing their outrage, but this is our way of calling out the lads to be held accountable and to voice their own solidarity and say this is something we don't stand for either.\"\n\nThis is so important. Women certainly don't need men to speak on or lead movements on their behalf, but having men uphold, amplify and support the voices of women calling for change is essential. By holding each other accountable, men can make a difference in how women are treated across the country and the world. In a speech to the United Nations in 2014, Emma Watson said it's not just women who need men to work toward gender equality, men need it too.", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6553a8e1fc2d498d684f18f7/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/64caaf078d2682f137fb814f/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a53e3a6f47d0c38da437c2b/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-902439422.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/655ce8e4e1eb936f88cc8c4f/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/654d4d5b289230566ff3b777/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/654a82c75c4bfd102b099008/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a53e3a912eaec683c013ed0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-902439422fb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a53e3a912eaec683c013ed0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-902439422fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Brittney Mcnamara"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/darren-criss-golden-globes", "title": "Darren Criss Stood Up for Gender Equality on the Golden Globes 2018 Red Carpet", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Find out what actor Darren Criss said about gender equality on the Golden Globes 2018 red carpet.", "id": "5a53a66c099c032d3280764c", "keywords": "darren criss,gender,gender equality", "news_keywords": "darren criss,gender,gender equality", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a53a66c099c032d3280764c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Find out what actor Darren Criss said about gender equality on the Golden Globes 2018 red carpet.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a53e3a45ec05c5920811496/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-902439422.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a53e3a45ec05c5920811496/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-902439422.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\"This is our way of calling out the lads.\"", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a53e3a912eaec683c013ed0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-902439422fb.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Darren Criss Called on Men to Hold Each Other Accountable for How They Treat Women", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/darren-criss-golden-globes"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-01-08T21:34:29.546Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-08T21:34:29.546Z", "author": "Brittney McNamara"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "\"This is our way of calling out the lads.\"", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a53e3a912eaec683c013ed0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-902439422fb.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Darren Criss Called on Men to Hold Each Other Accountable for How They Treat Women"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a53e3a912eaec683c013ed0/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-902439422fb.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515447269.546, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
