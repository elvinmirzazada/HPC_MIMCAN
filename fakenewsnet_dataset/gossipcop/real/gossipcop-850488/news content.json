The pair revealed in May that they had moved in together only a few months after starting their romance \u2013 a decision Winter has strongly defended against detractors who have noted their 10-year age difference.\n\n\u201cThere are tons of people of all ages that live with their boyfriend. There are tons of people that live with their girlfriends, [and] tons of people that don\u2019t live together and are super happy,\u201d she told Refinery29 in May. \u201cBut I\u2019m super happy in the arrangement that we have. We love living together. It\u2019s just great.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: EW\u2019s Top Ten Rom-Com Movie Moments\n\nThe next month, reports surfaced that Winter gives Meaden an allowance. She quickly took to social media to condemn the rumors as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would NEVER pay my boyfriend any sort of allowance, nor would he ever accept if I offered,\u201d she posted on Instagram, June 21. \u201cHe BUYS his own stuff whether it\u2019s for me or for himself, and he more than pulls his weight for our life.\u201d\n\nWhile their relationship has always faced attacks due to their age gap, the couple continues to assert their happiness. Winter previously told Maxim, \u201cI needed somebody who had a lot of life experience and who was at a point in their lives that they could take care of another person, but where I didn\u2019t have to take care of them. Being with an older guy isn\u2019t always amazing, but I got lucky\u2014I have an amazing guy who\u2019s super supportive and loving and is just an all-around wonderful human being.\u201d\n\nIn celebration of their nine-month anniversary, Meaden wrote on Instagram, \u201cEvery day is an adventure and I couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d", "images":
