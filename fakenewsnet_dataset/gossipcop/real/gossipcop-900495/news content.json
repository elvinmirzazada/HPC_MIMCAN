At the end of the experiment, did each couple remain married or did they file for divorce?\n\nMolly Duff and Jonathan Francetic\n\nCourtney Hizey Photography & Emily Maultsby\n\nDuff was a commercial insurance adjuster from the suburbs of Boston. She always looked to her parent's marriage as a great example of love and devotion. When her father passed away in 2011, she grew closer than ever to her mother and two sisters. Duff had been in several long-term relationships before appearing on the show, but she had yet to find \"the one.\" She said that she was looking for a man who is funny, hard-working and loyal.\n\nAn Army veteran and financial associate, Francetic grew up in Florida with his parents but moved to the suburbs of Boston. Though his parents divorced when he was a teenager, Francetic learned how to be independent of his mother, who also instilled in him the importance of compromise and unconditional love in a marriage. While many of his close family and friends viewed him as a pragmatic soldier, Francetic admitted to having a romantic and sensitive side. He said that his perfect match would be a woman who is energetic and driven with a sense of humor and a passion for adventure.\n\nAt the conclusion of the season, Duff and Francetic decided not to remain together. In an intriguing twist, Francetic later started dating the season's specialist, relationship expert Dr. Jessica Griffin, a psychologist based in Boston. The couple announced their engagement in April 2019 and tied the knot in October 2022.\n\nShawniece Jackson and Jephte Pierre\n\nCourtney Hizey Photography & Emily Maultsby\n\nJackson, an entrepreneur and cosmetologist, is the eldest of 10 brothers and sisters and loves having a big family. Although her parents never married, Jackson witnessed what a healthy relationship looks like through her mother's marriage to her stepfather. Laziness is an absolute deal-breaker for Jackson, who values hard work and determination. She said that she wanted to be with a man who could keep up with her fun and energetic personality, make her laugh and keep her grounded.\n\nAs the eldest of fourteen children, Pierre is a natural leader and took on the role of a father figure to his younger siblings growing up. Although his parents were still together when the season premiered, he didn't exactly admire their marriage and looked to others for relationship inspiration and advice. The second-grade school teacher lived in Boston and found dating extremely difficult. He said that he was looking for an outgoing, mature and confident woman and was not interested in anyone with baggage from a past relationship. Like Jackson, Pierre finds laziness to be a big turn-off.\n\nJackson and Pierre remained together after the conclusion of the series. In 2018, they welcomed their first child, Laura Denise.\n\nJaclyn Schwartzberg and Ryan Buckley\n\nCourtney Hizey Photography & Emily Maultsby\n\nSchwartzberg was a teacher\u2013turned\u2013sales representative who lived in the suburbs of Boston. She grew up with two siblings and parents whose relationship she described as \"perfect.\" After the devastating and sudden loss of her boyfriend \u2014 who she believed to be her soulmate \u2014 almost two years before the premiere of the sixth season, Schwartzberg hoped to find another man whom she could connect with on the same level. Unfortunately, none of the men she dated before she joined Married at First Sight were able to compare. She said that she was looking for someone funny, passionate and ready to commit.\n\nGrowing up, Buckley was surrounded by a loving family and called his childhood with his three sisters and parents the quintessential American dream. Buckley's parents were still very much in love, and he has the utmost respect and admiration for their marriage. Buckley loved serving his community as a firefighter in the Boston area and enjoyed cooking for his buddies at the station. Although Buckley achieved most of what he hoped for in life, he said that he was missing that special someone to spend it with and admitted that it was because, in part, he could be picky at times. He said that he was looking for a woman who is energetic, thoughtful and sincere.\n\nWhile Schwartzberg and Buckley remained together after the conclusion of the season, the two ultimately divorced in 2018.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/ljWJbha1sStp_zO8kki1UJrtV4I=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(802x0:804x2)/married-at-first-sight-5cc03979b0824ab8904c1ef0d5daf2bb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HUL95hTOdn3IysL-GWW89rtUgCc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1059x539:1061x541)/gisele-bundchen-tom-brady-tout-39d7e59f4f5e4d26aae3a796b9a79bc7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/g81coT-UUgd1MegBggn7kJHRQAY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x599:961x601)/michael-shakira-caine-1-5bf1e09e151444f28dd97b6ebdee6941.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/DZDsB9iTHP9Q9hrf-cyphp9lDLA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x569:961x571)/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-kids-1-fee360562d894a8089b59d17c91528a8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/coQa4dBkosb4T8uaWt1YmF9g1C8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/todd-chrisley-kids-2-01d64ee7e35b46b88821ca2950f81329.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/cGLCjnDNB-6IdbCpCn9JzGp13rE=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/headshot-d1a12648293f4e51afa323df912ec592.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NhWJEMwDzw3mhCkW2276C5ksKJo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(772x0:774x2)/married-at-first-sight-3-1f0d76b25f414e0287b9afc9ad4dd979.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tjMrDcXjCJXWNAbp9Scaflem2QI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/married-at-first-sight-2-df511b222af44027a139968a98ff4f02.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/c7Dh5p5q8FOiJQ9kYGhEdtsbnLA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(59x259:61x261)/Married-at-First-Sight-01-041123-b7c06489bfdb4fc9be7d60b8274371d6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hWVQFOLz0nbxlpF_cgHfhtK7Hwo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x735:941x737)/pamela-anderson-tommy-lee-8187360a78984030abb94dc16adf0f9c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/2EVKOZ2WlwZFsyT1zjoDcbBQIwI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1039x569:1041x571)/nick-offerman-megan-mullally-1-c84fb9bd11cd40cdb9a2966cc5cfd549.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/uIUftOKTVhcSv66mzR7a5pjoU8o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(814x319:816x321)/kelsea-ballerini-tout-1-328ecd235ace453f8c47d8f6ccb5e432.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/fPJOEDxo2jeQoOX4yfanpNwF_HQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Lindsey-Georgoulis-2c04010b503447c18e36894f40fd288f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8Bb-aK-Rlz3G4AjwnREyFsjthHY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x509:981x511)/cher-relationship-history-split-4a28bf6d970d43babbf425510adf830d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NAhHz1qqtaja-Zm_TplPqf6pjRo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x614:1001x616)/david-foster-katharine-mcphee-1-0e2712d110e84f7a87e71742def033d0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/O2ZI5odUnko95ntDP__wb4R42zU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/sofia-vergara-joe-Manganiello07172344-2715a3505a8b4cedaf753b8a455f5531.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Xk5w_zgNRmFfzkrHQczKBhdxpM8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Tom-Girardi-erika-jayne-a99b666db8fe444cb87b08811230270c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9TGeTqaO5FCBmO1fgyGy3gTrWeg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(899x539:901x541)/tom-schwartz-katie-maloney-1-e6a4013c725740c5a6f4bdd228878bfb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/QkRVQtNLWn7ODRude5U0ElsOCcc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x169:676x171)/Chip-Gaines-Joanna-Gaines-01325f8fb59f4ba18a19a14f54c85169.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qsf08S7s3TUoxW4hJ3oy5YiO4yc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(389x203:391x205)/ree-drummond-foster-son-2-aab8aa46af59417c826d0f587791a958.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/NhWJEMwDzw3mhCkW2276C5ksKJo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(772x0:774x2)/married-at-first-sight-3-1f0d76b25f414e0287b9afc9ad4dd979.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brianne Tracy", "Brianne Tracy Is A Staff Editor At People.
