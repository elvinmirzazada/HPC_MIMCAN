I will put my mask on when I am doing those things and then I will jump into the shower to wash it off.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn.mamamia.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/03145629/jessica-chambers_blue.jpg", "https://cdn.mamamia.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/11112717/miranda-kerr-skincare.jpg", "https://cdn.mamamia.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/11112725/miranda-kerr.jpg", "https://new-cdn.mamamia.com.au/mamamia-pwa.appspot.com/custom/logo/Mamamia_Logotype_WHITE.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=810745638982745&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.omnycontent.com/d/playlist/3ea926be-9be7-482a-8ac3-a44f016e43d1/5feddae0-feec-4280-b27d-a93c005efd37/480f78b6-ddda-4bb8-a631-a93c0060019c/image.jpg?t=1534225915&size=Medium"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mamamia.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/11112717/miranda-kerr-skincare.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Chambers"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mamamia.com.au/miranda-kerr-skincare-vogue/", "title": "Miranda Kerr shares a detailed account of her morning-to-night beauty routine.", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "description": "Miranda Kerr skincare routine involves crystals, meditation and a whole lot of natural products.
