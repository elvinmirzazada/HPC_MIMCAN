But if you remember anything, odds are it\u2019s the S.N.L. Digital Short she collaborated on with Andy Samberg where sweet, intellectual, child star Portman transformed herself into a gutter-mouthed rap star. Well, Portman, Samberg, and the Viking helmet are all back for another go at, well, basically the same thing. In other words: once more, with Jar Jar.\n\nWith Beck Bennett in the Chris Parnell role as an interviewer both bemused by and scared of Portman\u2019s rap persona, the Annihilation star takes us all on a tour of what she\u2019s been up to in the intervening years. (As Bennett\u2019s character notes, it\u2019s pretty much the same sketch as before\u2014with more current references.) Black Swan, Portman\u2019s kids, and her ballerino husband all get a shout-out in this updated sketch. The sequel may not be quite as successful as the first attempt (mostly because it lacks the element of surprise), but a Samberg cameo is always welcome.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54205e6d1019a3955fea2c28/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65539ae223927aad8fa808a9/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654a775769c700a1da9899f5/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655be0f4718f13955438af15/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54205e6d1019a3955fea2c2c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655e54b5bdc5e91f203294b4/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660159ee60bb2d438ba5ff/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698159454492f4f8bbea9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/nat-rap.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/56ec46abffeffc951764dfec/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/656510d0affa7b4408631071/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6567a3e506cee864e583384a/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6564cb9e766ac2eb76f98953/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654136505e546965c63058fe/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654fb5bdd98dc3d25206dee9/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6549039ac95dc1d504c2a596/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54205e6d1019a3955fea2c29/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654bb1f157191a17f9610ca0/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Joanna Robinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/snl-natalie-portman-rap-video-star-wars-prequels-andy-samberg", "title": "S.N.L.: Watch Natalie Portman Rap About Star Wars Prequels as Andy Samberg Returns", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Wow, who knew Jar Jar Binks was packing so much heat?", "id": "5a76970c51dfe02fe324c1f8", "keywords": "natalie portman,andy samberg,jar jar binks,beck bennett,star wars prequel", "news_keywords": "natalie portman,andy samberg,jar jar binks,beck bennett,star wars prequel", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a76970c51dfe02fe324c1f8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Wow, who knew Jar Jar Binks was packing so much heat?\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Wow, who knew Jar Jar Binks was packing so much heat?", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "S.N.L.: Watch Natalie Portman Rap About Star Wars Prequels as Andy Samberg Returns", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/snl-natalie-portman-rap-video-star-wars-prequels-andy-samberg"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-02-04T05:36:10.841Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-04T05:36:10.841Z", "author": "Joanna Robinson"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Wow, who knew Jar Jar Binks was packing so much heat?", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "S.N.L.: Watch Natalie Portman Rap About Star Wars Prequels as Andy Samberg Returns"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QS8bma7LRX4?ecver=2", "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-A0iftflme4?ecver=2"], "publish_date": 1517722570.841, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
