We all have high points, low points, times we feel confident, times we feel less confident and so \u2026 but I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s not here.\u201d\n\nCindy Ord/Getty\n\nDe Lesseps, 52, was arrested in the early morning hours of Dec. 24 after attacking a police officer in Palm Beach \u2014 nearly a year after she wed now-ex-husband Tom D\u2019Agostino at the Florida destination.

I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018.\u201d\n\nA source told PEOPLE that \u201cLuann was out with a girlfriend at the Colony Hotel where she had her wedding brunch just a year ago \u2014 it was the first time she had been back to Palm Beach since the wedding.\u201d\n\n\u201cMemories from that day came flooding back, she was emotional and her behavior was out of character,\u201d the source added.\n\nDays after her arrest, she exclusively told PEOPLE that she would be checking herself into a treatment facility.\n\n\u201cAfter the events of last Saturday night in Palm Beach, I am truly embarrassed,\u201d she said. \u201cI have decided to seek professional guidance and will be voluntarily checking into an alcohol treatment center. I intend to turn this unfortunate incident into a positive life changing event. Once again, I sincerely apologize for my actions. I have the greatest respect for police officers and the job they do. My actions alleged in the police report do not reflect my core values and my law abiding character.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so grateful for the love and support that I am receiving from my family, friends and loyal supporters,\u201d she continued.", "images":
