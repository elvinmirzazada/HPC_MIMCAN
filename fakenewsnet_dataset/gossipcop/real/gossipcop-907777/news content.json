Credit: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nAfter quite the bad year in Hollywood, it's comforting to know the future appears to be in the right hands.\n\nWith two nominations at the SAG Awards, Call Me By Your Name and Lady Bird star Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet was asked on the red carpet if the Time's Up movement against systemic sexual abuse in Hollywood had an effect on young men.\n\nSEE ALSO: Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet was reportedly wrong about his contract silencing him on Woody Allen\n\n\"Absolutely, and thank god it is,\" the 22-year-old actor told E! News, standing alongside Lady Bird co-star Saoirse Ronan. \"I think at the level of campus sexual assault, for people my age this was a dialogue that was somewhat already happening.\n\n\"With the centralization, the Time's Up movement and hopefully at award shows like this, conversation's getting out there. Equality in the workplace, 50/50 by 2020, these are messages that are getting out there now.\"\n\nLast week, Chalamet announced on Instagram that he donated his salary from the upcoming Woody Allen film A Rainy Day in New York to charity.\n\nThe money will go to Time's Up campaign, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), and New York's LGBT Center. It followed criticism of his decision to work with Allen, who was accused of sexual assault by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow.\n\nChalamet said he refrained from talking about the choice to work on Allen's movie due to contractual obligations, although a report has claimed these restrictions don't actually exist in the contract.\n\nFeatured Video For You", "images":
