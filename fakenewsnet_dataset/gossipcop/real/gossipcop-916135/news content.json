She paired the top with matching flared trousers that sell for $69 and cute black strappy sandals. But our favorite part of the look was undoubtedly the super chic wide-brimmed black hat with netting that served as a modern take on a veil. The groom, meanwhile, looked hip in a light blue suit jacket, black shirt and scruffy beard.\n\nRelated: Emily Ratajkowski\u2019s Year in Swimsuits Emily Ratajkowski continuously posts photos of herself slaying in different swimsuits on Instagram.
