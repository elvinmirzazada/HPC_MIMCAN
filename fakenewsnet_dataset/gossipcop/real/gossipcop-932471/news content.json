The couple visited the small Kichwa village in the Amazon rainforest where thirteen families were trying to raise money to bring bathrooms to the town\u2014an amenity they had never had before.\n\n\u201cThey would have ten children, most of these families have ten children, and they all just go out in the bush,\u201d Scott told reporters at the LOCKED IN Book Launch and Screening in L.A.\n\n\u201cWe were working with them, helping to make their dream a reality while we were down there,\u201d Scott added.\n\nThe pair has worked closely with WE over the years, and their honeymoon is not the first time the lovebirds have traveled for a good cause. In September 2017, they spent a week in Kenya to work on sustainable projects with local communities. The pair even skipped out on a wedding gift registry, instead asking for donations to the nonprofit.\n\nScott told reporters that he purposely didn\u2019t extensively research the rainforest before their trip, and didn\u2019t really know what to expect when visiting the community.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if there were going to be gigantic creatures eating me, and apparently, down there, in the water you have alligators, but the rest of it is jaguars and anacondas,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThe rain, I didn\u2019t know how bad that would be, and we got caught a couple of times, but overall it was amazing.\u201d\n\nWATCH THIS: Drew Scott and New Wife Linda Phan Are Already Talking About Property Babies: \u2018We\u2019re Excited to Start That Chapter of Our Lives\u2019\n\nDuring their trip, the couple documented their experiences on Instagram, posting photos of themselves with locals from the village.\n\n\u201cWe had our hearts set on a different sort of honeymoon\u2014being able to immerse ourselves in the culture of #Ecuador and make a positive impact on the lives of people who live in this beautiful country is making our honeymoon dreams come true,\u201d Scott wrote.\n\nHowever, the couple did take a few days of rest and relaxation following their charitable escapades and jetted off to the Galapagos Islands for two nights before heading home to Los Angeles.\n\nAs for what\u2019s next for the newly married couple? They\u2019re already beginning their family planning.\n\n\u201cWe said maybe twins, but why not have octuplets and just get it over with?\u201d Scott said with a laugh. \u201c[Linda] is the one that is pushing for [twins]. We both want to have kids, but we\u2019ve talked about having two, three, four. I just think we see what happens, see where it goes, whether we have boys or girls. We get a lot of our baby itch with the fact that her two sisters have kids, so we get a lot of time with our nieces and nephews.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/FYSGhMwKvo1MGb_1WAoiSFwiyKE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/king-charles-III-queen-camilla-bordeaux-092223-12-53bf888defbb47e386acca00e665f90f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HeDKU2SZJm2slFAw3vzBG7eAi2o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/unknown-37-2000-e273d832d7864929af01287d89b8e2b0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4WwGZogL73uoD0CdHLykIFtTxAE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(745x115:747x117)/jonathan-scott-zoey-deschanel-081623--a1f4716095c94d239895967513c32b43.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3GXfCQMBYC3NMTvKDoyVUS7YRik=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(599x0:601x2)/Suzanne-Somers_Home_TOUT-72d6999e87594e76a3c4975d29d758f6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/TIqc1zp7-_46s0MWnQzZg062YQA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Zooey-Deschanel-and-Jonathan-Scott08222369-79efa1e7487c463d91e2c463baa2313a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2xR4n212xUMBzwaBHp2kBkrV36I=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/jonathan-scott-zooey-deschanel-082923-tout-c4481df6bf9843c99127022c0e7d8dc5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/wcU58aap1bHuMYzozodS0fMHwdo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(593x290:595x292)/Jonathan-Scott-Zooey-Deschanel-1-cf5f1d4153f04521a7b44b74b919eacf.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/QUYCz1-hvUwgS3k--gwlZNGhnAo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(798x0:800x2)/drew-scott-and-linda-phan-nursery-reveal-101311-1-b666e9a9f4be40b3a0a68ba27671f2c0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/v5o71atof0wMTeMTm-AdrAyrqgE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(539x0:541x2)/Celebs-in-Italy-083023-2-20f236d1f54b483fbeac5d88d6128c1e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/YqDxM1QgcuwGsoCW4wLC0ygldrg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(539x0:541x2)/drew-scott-halloween-tout-110223-1ecdd2fa7bf14b4983776ec50ae1a924.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/R3yiy9po3djPvcTS4es70C9D_n0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/adam-byrnes-marries-amanda-toler-7-100923-5863a3e660944500ab3ac3a9ba0b0a7d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/IULrOebvI1wpQChqFBGg3e3FNfs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(647x554:649x556)/zooey-jonathan-3-0845d6dd58ea4f6495ca76bf7cef9837.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ffuVtYu8NgX9-QI12ZIuyRGpyio=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(636x0:638x2)/zooey-deschanel-1-6b80dbdd85664cdcb01f35cffc87b7d2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/6HGMrr5DE_I59Wv89cUaOs6ooYo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/zooey-deschanel-jonathan-scott-engaged-tout-8220c8738e5b4d3ab3332d8b02d0a4ac.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0i97f4b5ImqFqgfOMRDCtcUAvlA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(708x140:710x142)/zooey-deschanel-engagement-trip-090823-1-a9106c21269d4a47a8b4ebea1752ce1e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8wClnCnsjCwUdaAELHVX8FEswkY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(791x168:793x170)/Prince-William-andy-warhol-091923-tout-206d043619674790b0a302a253fd9b62.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/eP4c5PxUwiQrcRDwhp5ZsQnTyao=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(739x129:741x131)/Real-Life-Love-Boston-couple-Donato-and-Magda-Frattaroli-tout-092523-801cace4aaa44b1fb114e8ddcd66fe21.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/HeDKU2SZJm2slFAw3vzBG7eAi2o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/unknown-37-2000-e273d832d7864929af01287d89b8e2b0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madison Roberts", "Madison Roberts Is A Former Writer At People.
