'Teen Mom OG' Stars Aren't Happy With Farrah Abraham's Replacement Source: MTV\n\nFarrah Abraham's Teen Mom OG replacement has been announced and the other ladies are NOT thrilled about MTV's decision to bring a new girl on the reality series.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: MTV\n\nAs it was previously reported, Are You The One? star Cheyenne Floyd is allegedly replacing Farrah on Teen Mom OG.\n\nSource: MTV\n\n\u201cAmber Portwood is pissed off about the new cast member,\u201d a source close to Amber told RadarOnline.com. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing Teen Mom for ten years and don\u2019t think they like the idea of someone who is a total newbie and has never even been on the show before coming on permanently.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: MTV\n\nCatelynn Lowell and her husband Tyler Baltierra are not happy either! A second source told the site, \u201cThey all just think it\u2019s stupid that they\u2019re bringing people from outside the franchise instead of bringing the OG\u2019s and the Teen Mom 2 cast together. Maci Bookout loves Chelsea Houska, Kailyn Lowry and Amber get along, it just makes more sense.\u201d\n\nSource: MTV\n\nThe insider added how Tyler is \u201cfed up with all the drama the show has brought them.\u201d Adding, \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t think the show is going to last very much longer unless the new cast member brings in amazing ratings, but they aren\u2019t really holding their breath.\" Catelynn \"feels like the show has absolutely nothing to do with the kids anymore so they\u2019re just waiting for MTV to pull the plug.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: MTV\n\nAs fans watched, Farrah was fired from the show for her involvement in the adult entertainment video industry, as well as her attitude towards the crew. \u201cNo reaction,\u201d she told Radar about how she feels about her replacement. \u201cI don\u2019t watch the show anymore as I\u2019ve moved on. The show was done when I left.\u201d\n\nSource: MTV\n\nDespite most cast members not being happy with the new member, one person has a different opinion! \u201cCory Wharton is my guy so I\u2019m glad he\u2019s on board,\u201d Javi Marroquin said to the site. \u201cGood decision for his family.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: MTV\n\nAs previously reported, Cheyenne has a one-year-old daughter, Ryder.\n\nSource: MTV\n\nShe shares her daughter with The Challenge star Cory. The two have been co-parenting their daughter together and are not romantically linked.
