However, Rob recently confirmed to Us Weekly that the two have remained friends since they broke up last year.\n\nHow to Watch Watch Vanderpump Rules on Peacock and the Bravo app.\n\nIn fact, Rob isn't exactly ruling out rekindling his romance with Scheana in the future, either. \"The way we broke up, it wasn\u2019t a bad breakup,\" he told Us Weekly. \"If there is the right time, we\u2019ll find the right time.\u201d\n\nBut for now, Rob is moving on. \u201cWell, I am dating someone. I am dating someone as of a week and a half ago, so we will see what happens,\u201d he shared. \u201cShe\u2019s a pretty awesome person. But yeah, we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nScheana opened up about her breakup from Rob during the Vanderpump Rules Season 6 reunion. She explained that Rob started to \"pull away\" from her when the rumor about him kissing another girl came out during the season. \"I was head-over-heels in love with him. I was for a really long time, and it didn't work out,\" Scheana said through tears during the reunion. \"But I have loved Rob for 12 years, and he broke my f---ing heart. For the first time, that genuinely broke me.\"\n\nWhen Andy Cohen asked Scheana if she's been dating a lot during her stint in the Las Vegas production of Sex Tips for Straight Women for a Gay Man, she said, \"I've been going out quite a bit, yeah.\"\n\nRumors that Scheana was dating The Bachelorette alum Robby Hayes broke in March, but the SURver insisted that the two were just \"very good friends\" during an interview with Us Weekly at the time.\n\nWatch Scheana talk more about her post-Rob life, below.", "images":
