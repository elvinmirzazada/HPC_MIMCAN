We grew up together and we were in The Lord of the Rings together, but never ever dated.\u201d\n\nAside from being just friends, there was another reason the two never got together while co-starring in The Lord of the Ring movies.\n\n\u201cI was with Royce [Langdon] then, my first husband, and madly in love with him, so I wasn\u2019t on the market,\u201d she shared. Langdon and Tyler were married from 2003 to 2009.\n\nThat being said, the LOTR set wasn't all that innocent. \"We all flirted,\" Tyler admitted. \u201c...But no, I\u2019ve never gone out with Orlando.\u201d\n\nWhile Tyler and Bloom were never a thing, the 41-year-old actor recently confessed that he was interested in another one of his LOTR co-stars: Cate Blanchett.\n\n\u201cI had such a crush. I had the biggest crush on you,\" Bloom admitted to Blanchett on The Late Late Show with James Corden last month.\n\nThe crush wasn\u2019t mutual, but that may just be because the 49-year-old actress didn\u2019t know who Bloom was for a large portion of her three weeks on set.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t recognize you, because the first time I saw you, you had hair -- like Fabio hair and blue eyes,\" Blanchett recalled. \"And then I just saw you -- who is this really cute guy out of drama school -- and I didn\u2019t put two and two [together].\"\n\nBloom chimed in, \"And I was just walking around spying on her from the corner of the room -- in a non-creepy way.\"\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean star currently has his eye on someone else -- Katy Perry, his long-time on-again, off-again girlfriend.\n\n\"They know each other\u2019s patterns and the communication between them has improved, so their relationship is thriving,\" a source exclusively told ET back in May of the couple, who recently enjoyed a date-night in London. \"They are happier than they've ever been and feel in time they will be ready to be more public about their love for one another and can plan for a future.\"\n\nThe source continued: \"They are talking about a future wedding, but they are taking it slow.\"\n\nHere\u2019s more on Bloom's real-life romance:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2020-07/1280katedax.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/tylerbloom.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-07%2Ftylerbloom.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-06%2Fblanchettbloom.jpg%3Fh%3D6c0b92b2&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-01%2FLOTR_vidpic_013117_1280Copy2.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2F1280_katehudson_getty944494840.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/tylerbloom.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/liv-tyler-addresses-rumors-that-she-once-dated-orlando-bloom-106256", "title": "Liv Tyler Addresses Rumors That She Once Dated Orlando Bloom", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/tylerbloom.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The actors starred in 'The Lord of the Rings' movies together.", "title": "Liv Tyler Addresses Rumors That She Once Dated Orlando Bloom", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/liv-tyler-addresses-rumors-that-she-once-dated-orlando-bloom-106256", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The actors starred in 'The Lord of the Rings' movies together.", "twitter": {"description": "The actors starred in 'The Lord of the Rings' movies together.", "title": "Liv Tyler Addresses Rumors That She Once Dated Orlando Bloom", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/liv-tyler-addresses-rumors-that-she-once-dated-orlando-bloom-106256", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/tylerbloom.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Liv Tyler Addresses Rumors That She Once Dated Orlando Bloom | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Liv Tyler, Orlando Bloom, Katy Perry, Cate Blanchett, Lord of the Rings", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
