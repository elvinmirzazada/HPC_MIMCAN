The actress, who plays matriarch Rebecca Pearson on NBC\u2019s hit drama series, says the next three episodes of the show will get darker as the focus shifts to each of the Pearson siblings and their pasts.\n\nThe next three episodes of This Is Us will each revolve around one of The Big Three\u2014Kevin (Justin Hartley), Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Sterling K, Brown). The episodes, titled \u201cNumber One,\u201d \u201cNumber Two,\u201d and \u201cNumber Three\u201d will heavily feature the characters\u2019 teen counterparts, played by Logan Shroyer, Hannah Zeile and Niles Fitch, respectively. But because the Big Three\u2019s teen years was also the era that their dad, Jack (Milo Ventimiglia), passed away, viewers will experience the family\u2019s dark times in the flashback sequences.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s darkness coming,\u201d Moore told E! News of the upcoming This Is Us episodes.\n\n\u201cThe next three episodes are sort of a trilogy of sorts and they go to some deeply darkly places.\u201d\n\nMandy Moore revealed that viewers will likely have \u201ca lot of opinions about\u201d the three episodes, and asked that fans just be patient, hinting there will be \u201cbigger payoffs later\u201d this season.\n\n\u201cI would just suggest that people be patient,\u201d Mandy said. \u201cIt will all unfold in a spectacular way, and I don\u2019t think people will be disappointed.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with People, Mandy Moore admitted she had to prepare herself for some of the \u201cheavy\u201d episodes that are coming up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared about the rest of the season because I know we have some real heavy moments coming up this season that need to be addressed in regard to [Jack\u2019s] passing, so I\u2019m trying to prepare myself for that,\u201d the This Is Us star said.\n\nThis Is Us fans have been clamoring for more clues on how Jack died ever since it was revealed mid-last season that the character is not alive in the present day. Jack is only seen in flashbacks through the late 1990s, and his wife has married his best friend, Miguel (Jon Huertas). The Season 2 premiere ended with Rebecca pulling up to a burnt-out Pearson family home with her husband\u2019s personal belongings on the seat beside her as she let out an agonizing wail.\n\nMoore revealed that shooting the scene that depicted the aftermath of the house fire was a surreal experience. This Is Us producers built a facade of the Pearson\u2019s Pittsburgh house and then burned it, but Mandy didn\u2019t see the set before filming the scene. When the actress pulled up to the burnt-out house for the scene, it was actually the first time she had ever seen the burnt remains of the Pearson\u2019s family home.\n\n\u201cMy reaction of seeing the house for the first time was my genuine reaction to seeing it for the first time,\u201d Moore told People. \u201cI really didn\u2019t take a peek before the camera was rolling. So it wasn\u2019t super difficult to get into that frame of mind and tap into that raw emotion.\u201d\n\nBased on Mandy Moore\u2019s hints about the upcoming episodes of This Is Us, it sounds like viewers won\u2019t have any problem tapping into raw emotions either.\n\nTake a look at the promo for the upcoming This Is Us episode trilogy.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP_oxuGXoeM\n\nThis Is Us airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.\n\n[Featured Image by Ron Batzdorff/NBC]", "images": ["https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/inquisitr_cross.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v3/assets/search-icon.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Victoria Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4613819/mandy-moore-says-this-is-us-is-about-to-get-really-dark-warns-fans-of-heavy-episode-trilogy", "title": "Mandy Moore Says \u2018This Is Us\u2019 Is About To Get Really Dark, Warns Fans Of Heavy Episode Trilogy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Mandy Moore has a warning for This Is Us fans.
