But it seems that Sony accidentally uploaded a press file that, when loaded into Photoshop, showed that alterations were made to reduce DiCaprio\u2019s chin and remove wrinkles from Pitt\u2019s neck. The altered photo can be seen above, followed by the unaltered version.\n\nSony has since deleted the press file and said in a joint statement with the film\u2019s production team that Pitt and DiCaprio \u201cdid not request any retouching of photography. [\u2026] We take full responsibility for the error.\u201d\n\nIn the upcoming film, DiCaprio and Pitt\u2019s characters look for one last chance at a big film in a Hollywood that has long since left them behind. But their lives are flipped upside down when their next door neighbor, Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), is infamously killed by Charles Manson and his cult.\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d will be released July 26, 2019.\n\nPage Six first reported news of the photo flub.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bob-iger-GettyImages-1236668881.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Once-Upon-A-Time-In-Hollywood-e1541122533404.jpg?fit=618%2C428&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-900655668.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/beyonce-renaissance-tour-inglewood.jpg?fit=300%2C169&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/beyonce-renaissance-tour-inglewood.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Once-Upon-A-Time-In-Hollywood.jpg?resize=640%2C443", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Francis-Lawrence.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Once-Upon-A-Time-In-Hollywood-e1541122533404.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pitt-DiCaprio-photoshop.jpg?resize=556%2C257", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Once-Upon-A-Time-In-Hollywood-e1541122533404.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster", "Lawrence Yee", "Umberto Gonzalez", "Scott Mendelson", "Box Office Reporter", "Jeremy.Fuster Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt-airbrushed-sony-photos-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/", "title": "Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt Airbrushed, Movie Studio Accidentally Provides Proof (Photos)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt Airbrushed, Movie Studio Accidentally Provides Proof (Photos) - TheWrap", "description": "Sony mistakenly releases Photoshop file for \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" promo pic", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt-airbrushed-sony-photos-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Once-Upon-A-Time-In-Hollywood-e1541122533404.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 428, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "published_time": "2018-08-08T18:40:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-08T23:06:32+00:00"}, "author": "Jeremy Fuster", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jeremyfuster", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Jeremy Fuster", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt Airbrushed, Movie Studio Accidentally Provides Proof (Photos)", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt-airbrushed-sony-photos-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-08-08T11:40:49-07:00", "parsely-section": "movies", "parsely-author": "Jeremy Fuster", "parsely-tags": "brad_pitt, leonardo_dicaprio, once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood, sony", "article-tags": "brad_pitt, leonardo_dicaprio, once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood, sony}", "article-section": "movies", "article-categories": "dailies, movies", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533753649.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
