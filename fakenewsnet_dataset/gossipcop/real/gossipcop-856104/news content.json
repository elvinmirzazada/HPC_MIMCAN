{"url": "https://people.com/tv/alan-thicke-widow-says-couple-planning-having-baby/", "text": "Just weeks before Alan Thicke passed away, the late actor and his wife were preparing to add a baby to their family.\n\nIn a new interview with E! News, Tanya Callau, who married the Growing Pains star in 2005, says that the couple was designing a nursery in their home in preparation of a new little addition.\n\n\u201c[Alan] went in for a full physical because we were planning on having a baby, so in order to go and do the whole sperm thing, he wanted to get a full physical and make sure that he was healthy and ready to go \u2026 the timing of it was just unbelievable,\u201d Callau says in the interview.\n\nFrazer Harrison/Getty\n\nThicke passed away unexpectedly on Dec. 13 at 69 years old after suffering a heart attack while playing hockey with his youngest son, Carter. But months prior to his death, he and his wife sat down with Tyler Henry for an episode of Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry, which will air next Wednesday.\n\n\u201cTyler did say \u2014 this is something that\u2019s uncovered on the episode \u2014but when you did your reading, Alan did ask him, \u2018Do you see children?\u2019 And Tyler said, \u2018No.\u2019 And I kept saying to Alan, \u2018Isn\u2019t it strange that Tyler didn\u2019t see that?\u2019 Two weeks before my husband died, we were already starting to build a baby nursery. We had designed it and met with our architect and wanted to do the baby\u2019s nursery upstairs \u2026 so it was near Alan\u2019s office and near my bedroom,\u201d Callau explains in the interview.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Alan Thicke\u2019s Sons Taking His Widow to Court Over Prenup She Claims Is Invalid\n\nCallau also notes that her husband later went in for a full physical after Henry brought up the topic of the heart numerous times during their filmed reading.\n\n\u201cThe fact that [Tyler] touched on the heart and kind of kept emphasizing that \u2014 my husband went in for a full checkup two months later and he had a full, clean health of bill. So what happened to Alan is a massive heart attack \u2014 an aorta. It\u2019s hereditary and there was no indication that that was in the family histories. It wasn\u2019t something that the doctors would have been looking for,\u201d says Callau. \u201cTo see Tyler keep mentioning the heart \u2026 it was devastating to me because you always want to protect your loved ones and if you could have prevented it or done something, you\u2019d want to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nHenry also explains in the sit-down interview that his job \u201cis really just to relay sometimes the medical susceptibilities that I\u2019m told people have. In that case, that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Learn The Process Behind Time Selecting The 100 Most Influential People\n\nLast week, according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE, Thicke\u2019s two eldest sons \u2014 Brennan and Robin Thicke \u2014 filed a petition against Callau and claim in the documents that she is now alleging that the prenuptial agreement she signed ahead of marrying the actor in 2005 is invalid.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, despite Alan\u2019s generous benefits and careful planning Tanya demands more. Tanya insists the Prenuptial Agreement that she entered into before marrying Alan is invalid,\u201d the documents state.\n\nBut according to Callau\u2019s attorney Adam F. Streisand, she \u201chas never claimed that the prenup is invalid and has no intention of ever claiming it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTanya Thicke has never threatened to take private family matters public and she never has,\u201d Streisand said in a statement to PEOPLE. \u201cIt is clear that Alan\u2019s sons have chosen this distasteful public smear tactic to bully Tanya, by stirring up the tabloid media, filing a bogus lawsuit, and refusing family mediation. Tanya is still grieving the death of her beloved husband and out of respect for Alan\u2019s memory intends to handle his sons\u2019 false statements privately.\u201d\n\nHollywood Medium with Tyler Henry airs Wednesdays (8 p.m. ET) on E!", "images":
