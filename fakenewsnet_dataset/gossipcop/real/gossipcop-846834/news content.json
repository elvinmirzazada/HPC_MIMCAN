Here's every time they've taken to Twitter and Instagram to lightly poke fun at each other. To be continued, no doubt.\n\nOctober 17, 2021 - Blake trolls Ryan's big announcement\n\nWhile promoting his upcoming film Spirited on Instagram, Ryan revealed to fans that he is planning to take a little sabbatical from acting and Blake took the time to share a savage (and very Blake and Ryan) response.\n\nSpirited stars Reynolds alongside Will Ferrell and Octavia Spencer and is a modern re-telling of Charles Dicken's 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. In a recent Instagram post Reynolds thanked his co-stars while announcing that since the movie had wrapped filming he would be taking a short break from films for a little while.\n\nWhile others, from Hugh Jackman to Spencer herself, praised his talents Blake had a slightly more brutal reaction to the news, writing, \"Michael Caine did it first.\"\n\nRyan Reynolds // Instagram\n\nI mean, savage but not wrong...\n\nHere are all the other times Blake has trolled Ryan, and Ryan has trolled Blake.\n\nMarch 28, 2015 - Blake trolls Ryan\n\nBlake kicked the playful trolling off ahead of the first Deadpool movie, making fun of Ryan's pose. Shout out to the hashtag #CanSomeonePleaseGiveThatBearABreak.\n\nApril 4, 2015 - Blake trolls Ryan\n\n\"Should I be concerned that my husband's never looked at me this way?... #WhereAreThoseEyesWanderingReynolds#HelenMirrenIStheSexiestWomanAlive#WomanInGold\", Blake wrote about Ryan and Helen Mirren during the press tour for Woman In Gold.\n\nApril 27, 2017 - Blake kicks off the real trolling\n\nPatrick McMullan // Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo years after beginning the head-to-head troll-a-thon (yes we just said that), Blake takes things up a notch with this hilarious caption on a photo of Ryan at a John Legend gig.\n\n\"Congratulations to the most influential person in my life. The best man I know... you deserve this @time100 honor ... If only my husband wasn't blocking you in this shot. I'm so sorry @johnlegend\", she wrote.\n\nUnfortunately the photo has since been deleted, but you get the idea.\n\nAugust 25, 2017 - Ryan hits back on Blake's birthday\n\nRyan posted a picture of the two of them with half of Blake's face cut off with the caption, \"Happy Birthday to my amazing wife.\"\n\n\n\nOctober 19, 2017 - Blake trolls Ryan's fashion choices\n\nAfter changing five times(!) in one day, Blake reckons Ryan's getting a little complacent in his fashion choices, sharing a photo with the caption, \"@vancityreynolds didn\u2019t even do one outfit change from the sidewalk to the inside. (Lazy)\"\n\nOctober 23, 2017 - Blake gets revenge on Ryan's birthday\n\nThis is a personal favourite, after Blake shared a photo of half of her husband with Ryan Gosling, along with the caption, \"Happy Birthday, baby.\" Amazing.\n\n\n\nNovember 6, 2017 - Ryan trolls Blake's latest movie look\n\nRyan gets his own back (again), sharing a picture of Blake on set filming The Rhythm Section along with the caption, \"#nofilter\". These two.\n\nDecember 22, 2017 - Blake isn't impressed by Ryan's baking skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\"@vancityreynolds made some Christmas cookies... \ud83d\ude33 ...He\u2019s verrry handsome though\" she wrote, insinuating his baking left a lot to be desired.\n\nFebruary 14, 2018 - Ryan's Valentine's Day surprise\n\n\"I baked this cake for my wife. The icing is glue, \u2018cause I\u2019m not a scientist\" he wrote, holding a cake covered in strawberries. Cute.\n\nMarch 31 2018 - Ryan shuts down marriage woes rumour in hilarious way\n\nThe actor managed to turn a rumour about their marriage breaking down into a hilarious way to troll his wife, quote tweeting \"Deadpool Ryan Reynolds and wife Blake Lively struggling to spend 'quality time'\" with, \"I wish. I could use a little 'me time'.\"\n\nApril 8, 2018 - Blake's more proud of her hair than her husband\n\n\"If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m infinitely proud of in this picture, it\u2019s the incredible hair styling that I did on myself\" she wrote, alongside a picture with Ryan at A Quiet Place premiere.\n\nMay 18, 2018 - Blake's back at it again in Ryan's Instagram comments\n\n'Is the extra distance between you supposed to convince me that you DON\u2019T love him more than me?? Nice try,' Blake commented on the photo of Ryan with Hugh Jackman, which the actor had captioned, \"Ran into this guy at his coffee shop, @laughingmancoffee. And by \"ran into\" I mean I followed him there.\"\n\nMay 29, 2018 - Ryan trolls Blake's latest movie trailer\n\nPromoting her forthcoming movie, A Simple Favour, Lively shared a trailer on Twitter\u2014along with a series of very mysterious emojis. Reynolds, can't take the mystery any longer, and he's ready for some immediate answers. In response to her post, the Deadpool actor tweeted:\"You can tell me. We\u2019re married. You once drove me to the hospital when you were giving birth. So\u2026 what the f*ck happened to Emily?\"\n\n\n\n10 September, 2018 - Blake trolls Ryan\n\nRyan just wants the world to know about his gin company, Aviation Gin. But Blake's not having any of it.\n\n\"OHMYGAWNYOUREHUGE\". LOL.\n\n17 September, 2018 - Blake and Ryan troll each other\n\nThis weekend, Ryan took to Twitter to support his wife's new film, A Simple Favour, and wrote, \"This movie cured me of my virginity.\" A bit weird, but we get the idea.\n\n\n\nBlake replied with, \"@VancityReynolds \ud83d\udc8b\u2665\ufe0f\ud83c\udf46\ud83d\udca5 (No that's not emoji climaxing. I just really like eggplants. Pyrotechnic ones.)\"\n\nNo, we don't have any idea what's going on either.\n\nSeptember 30, 2018 - Ryan trolls Blake\n\nBlake is still out here promoting her film A Simple Favour, most recently sharing an Instagram picture of her in a suit while a naked man lies in front of her and holds a martini up for her. \"My turn... @asimplefavor \ud83d\udcf7: @timpalen\", she captioned the sexy pic.\n\nIn the comments, Ryan replied, \"He seems nice.\" LOL.\n\nNovember 2, 2018\n\nRyan Reynolds is at his trolling antics again, this time implying Blake Lively cheated on him 20 times... with ghosts. The actor replied to a tweet which read, \"Woman who had sex with 20 ghosts is now engaged to a spirit\" with, \"THIS is how I find out?\"\n\nOf course the actor did the only thing he knew how when he stumbled across an article about a woman claiming to have sex with ghosts: pretend it's your wife. Now that he mentions it, though, the woman does look a bit like Blake. ~Suspicious~\n\nAugust 26, 2019\n\nDespite taking a hiatus from trolling for almost a year, Blake and Ryan are at each other on social media yet again. This time round, it's Ryan trolling Blake, taking her birthday as an opportunity to share a selection of slightly-less-than-flattering photos on Instagram.\n\n\"Happy Birthday, @blakelively.\" he wrote to his 32.2million followers, with a gallery of pics of Blake with her eyes closed, looking the wrong way, or not quite ready for the photograph to be taken. Charming.\n\nHappy 32nd birthday, Blake!\n\nApril 15, 2020\n\nFamous cook Martha Stewart recently shared a video on Instagram Stories using Ryan Reynolds' gin brand Aviation Gin. Regramming the Story to his own account, Ryan joked, \"When my wife sees this \u2026 I\u2019m getting pregnant.\"\n\nLively replied on her account: \"@vancityreynolds you\u2019ve finally done it. Wear something sexy tonight.\"\n\nThese two are obviously very big fans of Martha, and we're very big fans of them.\n\nInstagram Stories/Blake Lively\n\nApril 25, 2020\n\nBlake comes for Ryan over his itty-bitty ponytail, sharing a photo with her 28.6million followers with the caption, \"I dare you to forget this every time you see him for the rest of eternity.\"\n\nNot one to take trolling lying down, Ryan regrammed the photo and hit back, \"clearly your birth control doesn't work, so...\"\n\nInstagram/Blake Lively\n\nMay 27, 2020\n\nBlake Lively trolls Ryan Reynolds over a photoshopped underwear picture, after a meme account shares a hilarious fake edit of the Deadpool actor. \"#ryanreynolds,\" @ronaldmcdonkey captioned the photo, which showed a fake version of the actor lying on a supermarket checkout in his pants.\n\n\"Please stop stealing my personal photos,\" Blake commented, before adding a winky face n another comment. Hilarious.\n\nJune 24, 2020 - Ryan trolls Blake with Aviation gin advert\n\nWhat would Father's Day be without Ryan Reynolds using it as an excuse to troll his wife? In a new advert on his gin Aviation's Instagram, dramatic music plays and it reads, \"When I had my first, my life changed immediately. I didn't think my heart could get more full. Then along came the second and sure, I'd never been busier, but life just got better and better. A couple years later we had a third. And the little one makes me so proud. They're the light of my life.\"\n\nWhile it feels like Ryan is referencing his three children with Blake - James, Inez, and a daughter whose name is unknown - then comes the punch line. \"And with three kids in the house, I need them more than ever.\" The ad then shifts to a picture of three Aviation gin bottles neatly lined up in a row. Hilarious.\n\n\n\nJuly 23, 2020 - Blake and Ryan are back at it, this time with a spot of light trolling in his Instagram comments. The Deadpool actor uploaded a post to Instagram about the Hulu release of his 2010 thriller Buried. In character, the clip shows him taking a sip from a flask, which has been edited to feature his own Aviation Gin line.\n\n\"I think this just got me pregnant,\" Blake joked under the post. Ryan's reply? \"I will be out of the office starting July 22nd through the middle of ever and ever. If you need immediate assistance during my absence, please contact someone. Anyone. Otherwise I will respond to your message as soon as possible upon my unlikely return. Thank you.\"\n\nInstagram\n\n23 October 2020 - Ryan trolls Blake over her Photoshop fail\n\nBlake Lively and Ryan Reynolds have been trolling each other for FIVE years on social media, but their latest interaction might be the best one yet. After sharing a photo of the pair casting their vote in the American presidential election, fans noticed Blake had drawn a pair of shoes on her feet, despite being shoe-less in the version Ryan shared.\n\nHere's Ryan's photo:\n\nAnd here's Blake's photo:\n\nFans trolled Blake for drawing on the pair of sandals (and tagging them as Louboutins no less), and then Ryan went one further and drew her a pair of boots:\n\nInstagram Stories/Ryan Reynolds\n\nThis is hilarious.\n\n24 October 2020\n\nWhat's a Blake/Ryan birthday without a trolling social media post from their other half? Nothing, we tell you. Blake and Ryan have made it quite the tradition to troll one another on their respective birthdays - and we wouldn't expect anything less at this point.\n\nWith Ryan turning 44 yesterday, Blake of course wouldn't let his birthday pass without some light roasting, joking \"I honestly can't believe we're still married.\"\n\nSharing photos on Instagram of Ryan eating a pie (yes, really) birthday cake, Blake wrote, \"1) Who is the lost soul that selects birthday PIE. 2) What ANIMAL eats their cake (pie) without first blowing out the candles. @vancityreynolds that\u2019s who. Happy Birthday. I honestly can\u2019t believe we\u2019re still married.\"\n\nRyan was, of course, looking absolutely adorable after being presented with his, erm, pie cake.\n\nInstagram - Blake Lively\n\nBlake continued the jokes on her Instagram Stories, showing a picture of her kitchen decorated with lemons and writing, \"Finally found a way to give him [Ryan] eco friendly balloons...\"\n\nInstagram - Blake Lively\n\n\n\nApril 23 2021\n\nOn Friday, Blake posted a sweet photo on her Instagram Story to wish pal Gigi Hadid a happy birthday - and of course took the opportunity to have a little dig at husband Ryan while she was at it.\n\nIn the photo, the celebs can be seen cuddling up to one another on a couch. Blake captioned the pic, \u201cHappy Birthday @gigihadid...I think you and I make a much better couple.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ryan is yet to respond to the post, we\u2019re sure it won\u2019t be long before he gets his own back. Watch this space.\n\nBlake Lively // Instagram\n\nAugust 25, 2021 - Ryan trolls Blake on her birthday\n\nTo celebrate Blake Lively turning 34, Ryan Reynolds did what he does best: Took to social media to troll her. Sharing a TikTok duet he made with Mariah Carey to his Instagram Story, Ryan wrote, \"My favourite thing that's ever happened on August 25th.\" Even better than your wife being born, eh?\n\nInstagram\n\nRelated Story 11 of the sweetest things Ryan & Blake have said", "images":
