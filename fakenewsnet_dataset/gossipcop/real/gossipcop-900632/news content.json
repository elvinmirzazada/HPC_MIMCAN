They haven\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s good, it\u2019s good,\u201d Sheeran said.\n\nSheeran wouldn\u2019t reveal the name of his Bond song because \u201csomeone might steal it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why Sheeran or any other musician would want to write and perform a song for the iconic film series \u2014 it would add the singer to a collection of superstars like Tina Turner, Madonna, Shirley Bassey and Paul McCartney. In recent years Bond songs like Adele\u2019s \u201cSkyfall\u201d and Sam Smith\u2019s \u201cWriting\u2019s on the Wall\u201d netted Oscars.\n\nSheeran wouldn\u2019t reveal the name of his song because \u201csomeone might steal it.\u201d\n\nCurrent Bond leading-mad Daniel Craig announced in August that he signed on to reprise his role for the fifth time (25th for the franchise as a whole). The upcoming flick doesn\u2019t yet have a director or title but is set to premier Nov. 8, 2019.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that if Bond producers do get in touch with Sheeran\u2019s people that the collaboration is better received than Sheeran\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d musical cameo.", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/12/18/XZ6L4377J2MSGRA4MHARL3FCLM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NYDN-LOGO-WHITE-J.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/12/18/XZ6L4377J2MSGRA4MHARL3FCLM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariel Scotti"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/12/18/ed-sheeran-wrote-a-james-bond-song-three-years-ago-just-in-case/", "title": "Ed Sheeran wrote a James Bond song three years ago \u2018just in case\u2019", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Ed Sheeran has had a song written for the James Bond movie franchise for three years now \"just in case\" anyone with the films calls him up", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ed Sheeran wrote a James Bond song three years ago \u2018just in case\u2019", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/12/18/ed-sheeran-wrote-a-james-bond-song-three-years-ago-just-in-case/", "description": "During an appearance on Ireland\u2019s \u201cThe Late Late Show,\u201d Ed Sheeran said that he has had a song written for the James Bond movie franchise for three years now, \u201cjust in case&\u2026", "site_name": "New York Daily News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/12/18/XZ6L4377J2MSGRA4MHARL3FCLM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "width": 1024, "height": 670}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-18T11:53:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-07T09:55:56+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Ed Sheeran wrote a James Bond song three years ago \u2018just in case\u2019"}, "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/12/18/XZ6L4377J2MSGRA4MHARL3FCLM.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cropped-DailyNewsCamera-7.webp?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513597986.0, "source": "https://www.nydailynews.com", "summary": ""}
