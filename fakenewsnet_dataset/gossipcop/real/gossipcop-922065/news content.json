Later, after Denise had another baby, Morgana, with a boyfriend who skipped town, she met Metz\u2019s future stepfather, a man she called Trigger.\n\n\u201cMy mom married Trigger at the courthouse,\u201d Metz writes in her book. \u201cSoon she was pregnant again, with another girl, Abigail. Trigger loved his two biological children, and was even welcoming to Morgana. Me, not so much. My mother was always at work, so she didn\u2019t see how he treated me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy body seemed to offend him, but he couldn\u2019t help but stare, especially when I was eating. He joked about putting a lock on the refrigerator. We had lived with a lack of food for so long that when it was there, I felt like I had to eat it before it disappeared. Food was my only happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so, I began to hide my eating. I\u2019d get up in the middle of the night and eat. I\u2019d sneak food to eat in the bathroom. Cookies, chips. Things I could eat as fast as possible to avoid detection,\u201d she writes. \u201cThings that would give me the brief bliss of numbness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember why Trigger hit me the first time. He never punched my face. Just my body, the thing that offended him so much. He shoved me, slapped me, punched my arm. He would hit me if he thought I looked at him wrong. I remember being on the kitchen floor after he knocked me over, and I was begging to know what I did. He just shoved me hard with his foot.\u201d\n\nFor more from Metz, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Chrissy Metz on the Panic Attack That Snapped Her Out of Depression and Motivated Her to Lose 100 Lbs\n\nAs Metz entered her early teens, the abuse became worse.\n\n\u201cWhen I was fourteen, Trigger began weighing me,\u201d writes Metz. \u201cHe\u2019d get the scale from the bathroom and clang it hard on the kitchen floor. \u2018Well, get on the damn thing!\u2019 Trigger would yell. \u2018This is what you need to know.\u2019 \u201d\n\nYu Tsai\n\n\u201cHe sat in a chair next to the scale as I got on. \u2018Good God almighty!\u2019 he yelled every single time. The number then was about 140 or 130. Most of my friends weighed about ninety pounds. \u2018Why are you getting fatter?\u2019 he demanded. I look at pictures of me from that time, and I would be so fine with being that size now. But I thought I was gigantic. By then the beating had escalated. One time he hit me, and I looked right in his face. If I had a gun, I thought, I would shoot you,\u201d she writes.\n\nStill, Metz was conflicted about her emotions regarding her stepfather.\n\n\u201cAfterward, I was so upset with myself,\u201d she writes. \u201cHow could I think that about this person I loved so much? Because I really did love him. This man did more for me than my father ever did. He was smart, and I was allowed to quietly join him in watching the Ken Burns Civil War documentaries on television. I clung to [these points of connection] because I needed to figure out why this person could do right by me as a provider, but be unable to love me.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: \u2018This Is Us\u2019 Star Chrissy Metz Recalls the Heartbreaking Moment Her \u2018First Kiss\u2019 Rebuffed Her with \u2018Disbelief and Disgust\u2019 in Public\n\nMetz writes that Trigger was eventually contrite about the situation and says they\u2019re now in a positive place. \u201cWe have a relationship now,\u201d says Metz. \u201cI do love him and I do care about him.\u201d\n\nAs a teen Metz used comedy to \u201cdeflect and deal with the hardships.\u201d Now happy and living her dream, the star says she has no regrets about her past suffering. \u201cWe all go through stuff. But I truly believe that everything that happened to me, happened for me.
