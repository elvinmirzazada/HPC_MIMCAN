Amy Smilovic is meticulous in her methodology. \u201cEvery season I build my wardrobe like a chain-link fence: each new purchase is meant to go on top of an existing base,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to feel new and modern without creating a total upheaval in your closet to get there. If you\u2019re rotating out your wardrobe every two years, then you really need to get a handle on what your core look is.\u201d\n\nRead more: Interiors Shopping With The Chapmans\n\nThis brings us to the final crucial factor: how much does all this cost? None of the women here stints on clothes, but equally none appears to have a chronic spending problem. They may splurge more on individual pieces, but they\u2019re probably spending the same percentage of their income as they did in their twenties, even when they\u2019re as ruthlessly immaculate as Ruth Chapman. \u201cProbably 50 per cent of my wardrobe is over two years old,\u201d she says. \u201cI never hoard, though. I regularly cleanse as I can\u2019t bear to have too many options. If I haven\u2019t worn anything for six months, it gets chucked. Ditto bobbled cashmere.\n\nI often buy two of the same thing if I fall in love. Fashion is as much about how the clothes make you feel as how you look.\u201d Does she feel guilty about the churn? \u201cFashion\u2019s a huge love affair for me \u2013 but I sell things on so that they have a second life.\u201d Smilovic is more businesslike. \u201cI either calculate price per wear or whether I\u2019ll treasure it, regardless. Everyone can make snarky remarks about the price of Vetements jeans, but in terms of cost per wear I\u2019m down to about a dollar. The emotional side is also very important to me \u2013 I love beautiful things. Maybe I\u2019m not going to wear it much, but sometimes I have to have it. I have an amazing Loewe dress in my closet just begging to be worn, but I\u2019m perfectly happy admiring it for now.\u201d\n\nRead more: Style File - Carolina Herrera\n\nSecond, third and fourth lessons? The art of fashion as you grow up is to master it, not the other way around, to let it help you project the person you want to be, to use it as a tool that fills you with confidence, and never to lose sight of what Alan Greenspan (not a fashionista, but a rare economist with a sparkling turn of phrase) would call its \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d. Or as Carolina Herrera puts it, \u201cI like it when fashion has some element of fantasy. Always leave room for fantasy. And try to do things with grace.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to Vogue here.", "images": ["https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615ea07410008b93986/2:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/original", "https://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue/assets/uk/logo.svg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615c6ae3400088a4a3a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/61ee750cb4ea23c107146811/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615a874380008571626/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/6565be2a05d405e7f63ab23b/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615c6ae3400088a4a3c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d5456152c0c410008892d73/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/65533974325db08118ea5b79/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/655f263fe63bc53d56eb07cc/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615ea07410008b93986/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/654d605501ef5c5403bc119a/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/656474346fd271db821b4d67/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/656465dfae21ed936741cf5b/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615eabedb00089dfa8b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue/assets/account-avatar.svg", "https://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue/assets/uk/logo-header.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615ea07410008b93986/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Lisa Armstrong"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/style-rules-for-dressing-your-age", "title": "On Fighting - And Winning - The Style Eclipse", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Fight the style eclipse.
