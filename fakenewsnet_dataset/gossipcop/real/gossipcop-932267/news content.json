{"url": "https://people.com/tv/khloe-kardashian-slams-tristan-thompson-for-cheating/", "text": "Tristan Thompson\u2018s cheating scandal unfolded for all to see on Sunday night\u2019s episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nAs Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian prepared to welcome the couple\u2019s first child, daughter True Thompson, on April 12 in Cleveland, she was still reeling from the revelation that Thompson had cheated on her, news of which broke after photos surfaced of him getting close to another woman just days before. Nevertheless, the mom-to-be decided that she wanted to put her feelings aside for the birth of her baby girl.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to stick to my birthing plan, because this is something that I\u2019ve waited for my entire life,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9, 34. \u201cI don\u2019t want to take away anything from this moment. I\u2019ve always been a big believer of don\u2019t make permanent decisions off of temporary emotions. I want Tristan here with me, I want to experience this magical moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want this for me and my daughter, and for him, at the end of the day,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m mature enough to say that. I\u2019m mature enough to put personal feelings aside. Me and Tristan will deal with him and I at a later time, when this isn\u2019t affecting our child.\u201d\n\nMom Kris Jenner and sisters Kim and Kourtney Kardashian flew in from Los Angeles, and while there were certainly some tense moments in the delivery room, everyone managed to remain relatively cordial.\n\n\u201cThe vibe in the room is calm. I thought there would be way more tension,\u201d said Kim, 38. \u201cAs much as I want to go off, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the time. So I\u2019m going to keep it cute. I don\u2019t have to have a lot of interaction, I just have to be there for her.\u201d\n\nWhen True was born at 4:00 a.m. \u2014 Kris delivered her, and Thompson cut the umbilical cord \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 was overwhelmed with emotion.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re experiencing a miracle take place,\u201d she reflected afterward. \u201cI\u2019ve always dreamed of being a mom, and I think I came to the place where I didn\u2019t know if that was actually going to happen for me, so the fact that we\u2019re in a delivery room \u2014 for myself this time, for me to give birth \u2014 it\u2019s just unreal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel so blessed. This is something that I\u2019ve waited for forever. I can\u2019t wait to meet her and just spend the rest of my life with her. The minute I met my daughter \u2014 I cannot believe I\u2019m even saying the words \u2018my daughter\u2019 \u2014 I was so in love with her. She\u2019s just perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was so anxious about having everybody in the hospital room because it was really crucial and important for me that it was a very healthy, happy, positive experience,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd everyone put their differences aside for that moment. I\u2019m really grateful for that. But obviously, there\u2019s a big elephant in the room.\u201d\n\nSPW/SplashNews.com\n\nAs for the state of her relationship with Thompson, 27?\n\n\u201cMy focus is not if we\u2019re going to be together or not,\u201d she said. \u201cMy focus is just on my daughter and having these beginning moments with my daughter and seeing him be such a great father to her \u2014 that\u2019s really what\u2019s important to me.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 also touched on how she decided on the name True, revealing that it was Kris\u2019 mother MJ that suggested it initially. (Khlo\u00e9\u2019s great-grandfather was named True, too.)\n\n\u201cI knew that I wanted the initials T.T., because I love that my initials are K.K.,\u201d she said. \u201cI was at dinner one night at my mom\u2019s house and MJ was there and I told her that. \u2026 We kept going back and forth, and True was the only one that really made the cut.\u201d\n\nA few days later, Kris and her daughters flew back to Cleveland to have a private, off-camera discussion with Thompson about the situation.\n\n\u201cTristan said to me that he wants to talk with my sisters and my mom. I have my own personal feelings because this happened to me, but my sisters also have their feelings and they are very much entitled to that,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s drama, people love to be like, \u2018Well, this is my relationship, I don\u2019t need to involve people.\u2019 Well, in this family, you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been very respectful that this is not Tristan\u2019s career, and having conversations like this isn\u2019t comfortable for him on camera,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe might not want to be as vulnerable as he normally would in private. Me and Tristan will deal with this at a later time, because there are some things [that are] deeper than being documented. It takes more time than just an episode.\u201d\n\nOn top of everything, the new mom was struggling with the fact that that she also had to deal with the situation playing out in the public eye.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much harder to deal with it when it\u2019s so public. Everyone is giving you their opinions and their input and their unsolicited advice,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the nurses and the doctors \u2014 everyone kind of like, looking sideways at the whole situation. That\u2019s hard, and it\u2019s humiliating.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe obviously f\u2014ed up, major, but I\u2019m not sure how I feel about everything right now,\u201d she added. \u201cIn two weeks I might be like, \u2018You know what? I don\u2019t trust you and this isn\u2019t for me.\u2019 Or I might say, \u2018This is perfect. Let\u2019s keep it going.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Most Iconic Kardashian Moments\n\nBack in Los Angeles, Kim filled in cousin Cici Bussey about how the conversation with Thompson went, admitting that she couldn\u2019t help but question whether he was sincerely remorseful.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018I think you\u2019re more remorseful because it\u2019s affecting your job,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s more embarrassed that he looks stupid, because of the public \u2026 booing him. And I think it\u2019s more of that than anything, and I told him that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the convo was going okay at the beginning and then it got heated. I don\u2019t know, it just kind of took a left turn,\u201d she added. \u201cOverall, I think it was definitely necessary for us to let out how we all felt, and since he is the father of Khlo\u00e9\u2019s baby, I definitely wanted to take the time to hear what he had to say.\u201d\n\nMaking matters even more complicated was that Kim was scheduled to appear on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. Inevitably, she was asked about Thompson and admitted that his actions were \u201cso f\u2014ed up.\u201d When she called her sister afterwards to give her a heads up, Khlo\u00e9 sounded defeated.\n\n\u201cIt is f\u2014ed up. And he\u2019s a complete piece of s\u2014,\u201d she said. \u201cHonestly, you can feel however you want, but I\u2019ve got other s\u2014 to deal with right now.\u201d\n\nBut Kim\u2019s interview didn\u2019t bode well with Thompson, and when Khlo\u00e9 told her sister that he thought she was being an \u201cinstigator,\u201d Kim was furious.\n\n\u201cI unfollowed him on Instagram. He should be embarrassed,\u201d she fumed to Kourtney, 39. \u201cI literally wrote to [Khlo\u00e9] and said, \u2018Look, let\u2019s change the subject. I love you and I support you, but I\u2019m done with him. Over it.\u2019 She just should have stood her ground.\u201d\n\nBut Kourtney was more sympathetic, especially because she\u2019d been through something similar with Scott Disick.\n\n\u201cShe should just do what\u2019s in her heart and she should either give it a chance \u2014 if that\u2019s what makes her feel best for her family, I\u2019ve been there,\u201d said Kourtney.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not realistic,\u201d Kim said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think his intentions are right. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to change,\u201d Kourtney said. \u201cBut I\u2019m just saying, if she wants to feel like she\u2019s trying for her own heart and know that she\u2019s doing her best, then I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that. I think it takes a lot more strength to hang in there and try for your family than to just walk away.\u201d\n\nEventually, Kim relented.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t make her feel bad about anything, but I just generally don\u2019t care to be around him,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever makes her happy. I\u2019ll stay out of the way.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images":
