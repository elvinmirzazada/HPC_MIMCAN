She was on her way,\u201d Angela shares. \u201cOur doctor made our gentle cesarean so special by allowing us to play our own music in the operating room, letting us witness her being born and giving me the privilege of skin to skin as soon as she was born.\u201d\n\nMatt admits that he was \u201cnervous being in the operating room because it all feels so high-stakes surgical,\u201d but the nervousness fell away when he \u201csaw her and heard her cry for the first time.\u201d\n\nUpon meeting their baby girl, it was love at first sight for the couple.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the most gorgeous baby ever,\u201d Angela recalls about seeing MacKenlee for the first time. \u201cI just thought to myself, she\u2019s perfect,\u201d says Matt.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

I grew up in a great family and have always seen that as something that I\u2019ve wanted to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to play catch with my kid,\u201d shared the actor. \u201cI want to kick the soccer ball with my little girl. So yeah, I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nFor more coverage, follow our babies magazine on Flipboard.\n\nBut although the couple had no problem revealing the sex of their first child before her due date, there was one thing they kept mum on: what they were thinking about naming her.\n\nIn December, the 90210 alum told PEOPLE that although he and his wife had an idea of what they were going to name their baby before her birth, they wanted to wait until her arrival before making an official decision.\n\n\u201cWe have one that we think we\u2019re going to go with. It\u2019s a family thing,\u201d Lanter said. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying what it is yet, but it\u2019s definitely not official because we want to see her first [to name her].\u201d\n\n\u201cShe might just not look like the name that we have [picked out]. So we\u2019re going to wait to make it official,\u201d Lanter added.\n\nHowever, the Pitch Perfect 3 star had previously revealed what they wouldn\u2019t be naming their child, telling PEOPLE that while he and his wife wanted a name that was \u201ca little different,\u201d they weren\u2019t going to give their baby \u201cApple or Banana or something like that\u201d for a moniker.\n\n\u201cWe like the idea of old-fashioned names,\u201d he explained.\n\nFROM PEN: Ali Fedotowsky-Manno Admits She Will \u201cDefinitely Support\u201d Baby Molly If She Wants to Be The Bachelorette!\n\nWhile the happy couple navigated the ups and downs of pregnancy as a team, Angela revealed to PEOPLE that carrying their first child didn\u2019t come without its difficulties.\n\n\u201cThe first trimester was a little bumpy,\u201d she said in August. \u201cI was pretty much textbook for all first trimester symptoms, but after battling endometriosis for many years, we are just so beyond thankful to have the chance to become parents.\u201d\n\nBut luckily, her husband was there every step of the way. \u201cMatt has gone above and beyond any expectation I could have had,\u201d Angela continued. \u201cFrom taking care of me when I\u2019m feeling sick, to never missing a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d", "images":
