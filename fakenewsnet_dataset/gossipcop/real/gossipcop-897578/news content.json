Whatever you do in life you give it your all. A lover of life who always sees the glass half full. I admire your strength, confidence, and work ethic (even if I complain about all the business calls). I love your fun, outgoing nature, and sense of adventure (even if our girls [and] I complain about the excursions you take us on we always end up loving it and happy you make us try new things). Thank you for being a loving husband and father and for everything you do for our family. Crazy that we have been together more than half of our lives. I love you so much and hope this birthday brings you continued health [and] happiness!\"\n\nIn July 2020, Mauricio had his hair shaved into a mohawk. Kyle Richards did not like it. In her Instagram stories, Kyle said:\n\n\"My husband has not cut his the entire quarantine, and I just found all of this. Oh my god. I have to see this hair.\" She panned over a pile of her husband's hair in the bathroom and went looking for him. \"What have you done to yourself? Are you kidding me?!\" she said when she saw his new mohawk. \"I gave myself a mohawk. I put the 'Moe' in to mohawk,\" Mauricio explained. Mauricio did abandon the mohawk. After all, happy wife, happy life.\n\nPersonal Real Estate\n\nIn 2011, Kyle and Mauricio paid $3 million for a mansion in LA's Bel-Air neighborhood.
