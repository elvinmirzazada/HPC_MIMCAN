News.\n\nAfter her mom asks if she\u2019s gone to see a doctor about it, Shannon reveals she\u2019s too afraid of what they might say.\n\n\u201cEveryone says if it\u2019s your hormones, then the weight will [come] off so easily,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not my hormones, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel so s\u2014ty about myself,\u201d she continues, getting emotional. \u201cWhen I look in the mirror, I don\u2019t even recognize myself, and I know that David is just disgusted with the whole thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I look at the mirror and don\u2019t like what I see, at least I can justify in my head. \u2018This is why David is growing apart from you, because look at you,\u2019 \u201d she says.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Shannon Beador Reveals She Lost 15 Lbs. and Has 25 to Go\n\nShannon and David have been working to repair their marriage over the past three years, ever since his affair nearly tore them apart. They recently renewed their vows in August, but according to the Bravo star, the situation hasn\u2019t improved since then.\n\n\u201cEver since our vow renewal, David keeps taking steps back from me, and now as I\u2019ve let myself go \u2026 we just kind of stay clear of each other,\u201d she says. \u201cA couple of weeks ago, he said our marriage isn\u2019t doing well.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll have thoughts about that affair and I think, \u2018Will I ever really get over it? Will I?\u2019 \u201d she confesses. \u201cAs I\u2019m so distant with David right now, I\u2019m reminded of the period of the affair. Before, I would be able to forget about it, because I would say, \u2018Everything is so great [between us].\u2019 But now it\u2019s not so great. It\u2019s like a vicious cycle.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County airs Mondays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images":
