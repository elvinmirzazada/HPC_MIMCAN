Setting that aside and judging this strictly as an action/narco drama straddling the Tex-Mex border, it's worth watching; if I could give half stars, I'd peg this 3.5. However, a soap opera/telenovela-style divorce story thrown into the mix is a weak plot addition that grows thinner and more annoying with each episode, taking away from rather than adding drama to the adaptation for television, bringing the series down from what would otherwise be a 4. The source material and conceit of the show dictate strong female characters must be involved, most of Latina extraction, but there are also still plenty of stereotypes to fill the required bill for entertainment executives to order an American network drama to production. It is a shame they and show developers didn't trust the audience to invest in a story set largely outside of the U.S., as is the case with Spanish author Arturo Perez-Reverte's original novel, but additions and deviations are always a matter of necessity when adapting books for television. Yet what is truly unfortunate is that they opted to shift the setting and Americanize the show with a host of additions but then turned the role of Guero, the one American of note in the novel, into a bit part. Although we mainly know him from Teresa's recollections,he was a charismatic, appealing, and crucial character, looming over all that followed when their romance and his death triggered her transformation and launched her into an extraordinary life. In the few scenes we see him, actor Jon-Michael Ecker, his devilish grin, and that holy thing between his legs seem up to the task of playing Guero. Giving him more screen time would have been a lot more engaging and effective than repeating the same conversations between Don Epifonia, would-be Sinaloa governor, and estranged wife Camila Vargas. Their divorce is a plot addition laden with potential that goes unfulfilled, their long-distance exchanges turning the show into cheesy telenovela via telephone, undercutting the character of Camila, who comes off more clueless than queenpin, and boring viewers in the process. If you haven't read the book, I highly and heartily suggest you do. It was so good that when I finished the last page, I immediately turned right back to the first, and knowing what's in it won't interfere with enjoyment of the show. That's because both are studies of character told in stories about the journey, not the destination. The book version is better, as is usually the case, but the show has enough to it to keep me watching.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91r6VBTPDAL._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91DaUvsllmL._RI_SX200_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ZVhniXjwL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91yipqwLQ3L._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/915M8-LHC6L._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/8161kTTnr+L._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1J0yQOE6EL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81DtjoTHWuL._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71LuTErdTkL._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81f91l7rKHL._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1F6CIJKjIL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/gno/sprites/nav-sprite-global_bluebeacon-V3-1x_optimized._CB508625733_.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1t4TvMFI8L._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91Cv6OPOp1L._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/915auLRxpEL._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/812RFkzy3gL._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91QlcjYiXHL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81FY2fJ25ZL._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91neYh5PKeL._UR150,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91a1UJC4SVL._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91mWLpwqXTL._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170702130541im_/https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Z9ujNyGDL._UR267,200_FMJPG_.jpg"], "top_img": "", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Professor", "T.
