The MTV personality revealed in a Wednesday, August 16, interview with Radar Online that she doesn\u2019t want her ex-husband Javi Marroquin to have a relationship with her yet-to-be named newborn son whom she gave birth to on August 5. (The child\u2019s father is Chris Lopez.)\n\nRelated: Celebrity Babies of 2017 Babies on board!

That being said, on my end, there is no bad blood. But I don\u2019t think there is any reason for him to necessarily be involved,\u201d the mom shared with Radar.\n\nAnd while Lowry and Marroquin have had an up-and-down relationship since their May 2016 breakup, the mom of three confirmed he did reach out to her after she gave birth.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask how he was handling it,\u201d she explained to the outlet. \u201cBut he did say congratulations.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 Star Kailyn Lowry Shows Off Her New Baby 'Teen Mom 2' star Kailyn Lowry is showing off her new baby after giving birth on Saturday, August 5 \u2014 see the adorable pics\n\nMaking things more complicated, Marroquin, who previously told Radar he wouldn\u2019t have a relationship with the newborn, might have a legal responsibility to the child.\n\nAttorney Brooke A. Camhi, who is not licensed in Lowry\u2019s home state of Delaware, revealed to Radar: \u201cDelaware law states that the ex-husband is presumed the father of a child if the child is born less than 300 days after the divorce.\u201d\n\nRelated: Teen Mom Stars, Then and Now! It\u2019s been quite a journey for the cast of Teen Mom. The series launched in December 2009 as the first spinoff from MTV\u2019s 16 and Pregnant. The debut season followed the lives of Maci Bookout, Catelynn Lowell, Amber Portwood and Farrah Abraham, who all experienced very different journeys during their teen pregnancies. On season 5, [\u2026]\n\nIn order for Marroquin to free himself of responsibility, he would need to file a valid denial of paternity with the Office of Vital Statistics. According to Statue 8-305, Lopez will be required to file a valid acknowledgement of paternity to \u201cdischarge the presumed father from all rights and duties of a parent.\u201d\n\nThe pair divorced after nearly four years of marriage after Lowry revealed she did not want to have another child with Marroquin. He would go on to accuse the reality personality of cheating on him while he was deployed by the Air Force.\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.

paternity situation. \u201cJavi is not the father,\u201d she explained to Radar. \u201cChris is the father so I think we\u2019re all going to work together to make sure everything is taken care of and
