I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2017\n\nThe magazine also took to twitter to respond to the President\u2019s claims.

The publication often releases several year-end lists that receive much notoriety. The \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d is one of them. Jay-Z, Beyonce, Kanye West and Nicki Minaj have all covered the magazine in the past on their list of 100 Most Influential People.\n\nLook out for The Person of the Year announcement on Dec. 6.", "images": ["https://streaming.thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Webp.net-resizeimage-13.png", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/S2-CHARLAMAGNE-Photo-credit-Nick-Fancher-360x240.jpeg", "https://streaming.thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Webp.net-resizeimage-7.png", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Will-and-Jada-Pinkett-Smith-Announce-Multimedia-Company-Westbrook-Inc.jpg", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/50-Cent-performing5-360x240.jpg", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Follow_Very_Round_Edges_Edges_275x50.png", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Offset-on-Reinventing-Himself-the-Person-Who-Inspired-Him-to-Go-Solo-And-Takeoff-s-Tragic-Death-shawnxgrant-gmail-com-Gmail.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=34210833&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC08981NardoWick-360x240.jpg", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/unnamed-5.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://thesource.com/wp-includes/images/rss.png", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Steve-Harvey-to-Gift-Eight-College-Students-With-23K-Scholarships.jpg", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TIME-Claps-Back-at-Donald-Trump-Over-22Person-of-the-Year22-Claims.jpg", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GoogleMobileAppIcon.png", " https://streaming.thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Webp.net-resizeimage-5-1.png", "https://thesource.com/source_logo_.svg", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/10367536jk-360x240.jpg", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/C-Murder-1-360x240.jpeg", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TSSDownload.jpg", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TheSource-scaled.jpg", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Young-Thug-YSL-Trial-Day-2-_-Watch-Live-1-18-47-screenshot.png", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-LZP_7FJpfuC2Z.gif", "https://streaming.thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Webp.net-resizeimage-37.png", "https://thesource.com/blm-720x90-2/", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image003-4-360x240.png", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image003-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TIME-Claps-Back-at-Donald-Trump-Over-22Person-of-the-Year22-Claims.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jiggy Jones"], "canonical_link": "https://thesource.com/2017/11/25/time-claps-back-trump/", "title": "TIME Claps Back at Donald Trump Over \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d Claims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "TIME magazine isn't here for Donnie's shenanigans.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "Elementor 3.16.2; features: e_dom_optimization, e_optimized_assets_loading, e_optimized_css_loading, additional_custom_breakpoints; settings: css_print_method-external, google_font-enabled, font_display-auto", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Source", "type": "article", "title": "TIME Claps Back at Donald Trump Over \"Person of the Year\" Claims", "description": "TIME magazine isn't here for Donnie's shenanigans.", "url": "https://thesource.com/2017/11/25/time-claps-back-trump/", "image": {"identifier": "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TIME-Claps-Back-at-Donald-Trump-Over-22Person-of-the-Year22-Claims.jpg", "width": 530, "height": 298, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-25T14:15:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-25T14:15:10+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheSourceMagazine/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "TIME Claps Back at Donald Trump Over \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d Claims - The Source", "description": "In the latest episode of POTUS 45, Donald Trump claims he denied TIME Magazine's offer to be named \"The Person of the Year.\" The president took to Twitter to reveal this claim, as per usual. https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/934189999045693441 The magazine also took to twitter to respond to the President's claims.
