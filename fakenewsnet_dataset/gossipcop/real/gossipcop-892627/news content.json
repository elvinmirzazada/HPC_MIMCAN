We want to say thanks to Taylor Swift. She couldn\u2019t be here tonight with us.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cTaylor, wherever you are, thank you for writing this beautiful song, and loving songs and loving Nashville. To the fans, to country radio, thanks for being so good to us.\u201d\n\nIn NYC for SNL rehearsals. I\ufe0f LOVE YOU @littlebigtown and CMAs. pic.twitter.com/3QT7bX6yOe \u2014 Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) November 9, 2017\n\nThough the \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d singer \u2014 whose sixth studio album Reputation is released Friday \u2014 wasn\u2019t at the show, the 27-year-old was there in spirit, following along with the live telecast.\n\n\u201cIn NYC for SNL rehearsals. LOVE YOU @littlebigtown and CMAs,\u201d Swift tweeted on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cI think Taylor tweeted that she loves us,\u201d Sweet said in the press room later that night.\n\nHis bandmate Kimberly Schlapman couldn\u2019t help but joke: \u201cWe\u2019ll take her award and put it on our shelf. She\u2019s got plenty! Maybe she won\u2019t miss it\u2026\u201d\n\nSwift made a surprise appearance at last year\u2019s ceremony to present the Entertainer of the Year Award. She also took time to celebrate pals Little Big Town, who took home the award for vocal group of the year.", "images":
