Nominated for Best Actor, Drama Gary Oldman, Darkest Hour\n\nThe nominations for the 2018 Golden Globe Awards were announced at the Beverly Hilton Hotel by Alfre Woodard, Garrett Hedlund, Kristen Bell, and Sharon Stone on Monday morning\u2014and as ever, the slate was full of surprises. The Shape of Water led the pack with seven nominations, including nods for best picture, director, and actress, all in the drama category. It was followed closely by The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, two more dramas that picked up a respectable six nominations apiece. In the comedy categories, Lady Bird reigned supreme with four nods, although it may face stiff competition from I, Tonya\u2014which got three\u2014and The Greatest Showman, the upcoming P.T. Barnum musical starring Hugh Jackman.\n\nThe biggest shock in the film categories, however, were the three nods given to All the Money in the World, a Ridley Scott film that underwent hasty reshoots and edits this fall after Scott decided to replace star Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer, following a series of accusations of sexual misconduct against Spacey. The movie has not yet screened for critics\u2014but evidently, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association has seen it, and liked it well enough to cite it for best director, actress (Michelle Williams), and supporting actor (Plummer).\n\nOn the television side of the aisle, Big Little Lies\u2014of course\u2014got the most nominations, scoring six total nods. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2014which, like Big Little Lies, recently won big at the Emmys\u2014was tied for most-decorated drama with This Is Us; each earned three nominations. Meanwhile, few comedies stood out from the pack; several series were give two nominations each, including Globes favorite Black-ish, Amazon\u2019s brand-new stunner The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Aziz Ansari\u2019s Netflix gem Master of None, the new Showtime hit SMILF, and NBC\u2019s well-liked revival of Will & Grace.\n\nFacebook content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nBelow, find a full list of nominees.
