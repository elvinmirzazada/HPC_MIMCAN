The pop star, who grew up in Santa Barbara, performed acoustic versions of her hits like \"A Part of Me\" and \"Firework.\" She dedicated the latter to 14-year-old Lauren Cantin, who was rescued from her home after it was engulfed by the mud and debris. Her father was unfortunately one of the 21 victims who were killed in the natural disaster.", "images": ["https://www.fuse.tv/_nuxt/img/instagram.c50a4f4.png", "https://www.fuse.tv/img/logo-header.png", "https://www.fuse.tv/_nuxt/img/youtube.4e8a45f.png", "https://www.fuse.tv/_nuxt/img/twitter.1650102.png", "https://www.fuse.tv/og-images/fuse-web-home_1200x630.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=34756675&cv=3.6.0&cj=1", "https://www.fuse.tv/_nuxt/img/facebook.a3f142a.png"], "top_img": "https://www.fuse.tv/og-images/fuse-web-home_1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Float Left Interactive"], "canonical_link": "https://www.fuse.tv/2018/02/katy-perry-surprises-thomas-fire-montecito-mudslide-survivors-at-benefit-concert", "title": "Fuse", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fuse TV", "author": "Float Left Interactive", "og": {"type": "website", "site_name": "Fuse", "url": "/2018/02/katy-perry-surprises-thomas-fire-montecito-mudslide-survivors-at-benefit-concert", "title": "Fuse", "description": "Fuse represents the best of the young multicultural generation, celebrating diversity with provocative and honest content.
