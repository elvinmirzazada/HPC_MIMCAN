Still Got My Head Spinnin,\" Ciara captioned the post.\n\nThe video was taken in one of the show's many \"Infinity Mirrored\" rooms, giving a perspective of endless expanse. This particular installation is titled \"Aftermath of Obliteration of Eternity.\"\n\nCiara also posted a clip of herself dancing in another mirror room, titled \"Phalli\u2019s Field.\"\n\nWilson and Ciara, who celebrated their 1-year wedding anniversary in July, also posed for pics in a number of other installations, including the \"Obliteration Room,\" where the couple added their own stickers to the millions of other colorful dots that have been placed over the previously-blank white room as part of the artwork's interactive and adaptive nature.\n\n\"Placed Our Dots In The Sticker Furniture Room. Incredible Experience.#DateNight #YayoiKusama,\" Ciara captioned the romantic pic.\n\nWilson also shared a video from inside their date night, showing Ciara contemplating a number of paintings on the wall.\n\n\"Mama's lookin' good looking at art on our date night,\" Russell narrated the clip.\n\nThe mesmerizing \"Infinity Mirrors\" exhibit comes to a close at the Seattle Art Museum on Sept. 10, and will be moving down to Los Angeles' Broad Museum from October 2017 through January 2018.\n\nWison and Ciara tied the knot in July 2016 in a stunning ceremony at the Peckforton Castle in Cheshire, England. They are parents to 3-year-old son Future Zahir -- Ciara's son from her previous relationship with rapper Future -- and they welcomed their first child together, daughter Sienna, in April.\n\nCheck out the video below for more on the cute couple's happy family.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-02%2Fet_ciara_021917_1280.jpg&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2023-11/GettyImages-1768304587.jpg?h=19de9ceb&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2023-11%2FGettyImages-1768304587.jpg%3Fh%3D19de9ceb&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2015-05%2F425_ciara_461984688.jpg%3Fh%3Da0c4f3a1&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/ciara_russell_wilson_getty547466864.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2Fciara_russell_wilson_getty547466864.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-07%2F1280_Ciara_Russell_Wilson_Instagram_072117.jpg&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/ciara_russell_wilson_getty547466864.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/russell-wilson-shuts-down-seattle-art-museum-jaw-dropping-date-night-ciara-see-pics-86590", "title": "Russell Wilson Shuts Down Seattle Art Museum For Jaw-Dropping Date Night With Ciara -- See Pics!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/ciara_russell_wilson_getty547466864.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The cute couple couldn't have had more fun at Yayoi Kusama's 'Infinity Mirrors' exhibit on Sunday.", "title": "Russell Wilson Shuts Down Seattle Art Museum For Jaw-Dropping Date Night With Ciara -- See Pics!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/russell-wilson-shuts-down-seattle-art-museum-jaw-dropping-date-night-ciara-see-pics-86590", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The cute couple couldn't have had more fun at Yayoi Kusama's 'Infinity Mirrors' exhibit on Sunday.", "twitter": {"description": "The cute couple couldn't have had more fun at Yayoi Kusama's 'Infinity Mirrors' exhibit on Sunday.", "title": "Russell Wilson Shuts Down Seattle Art Museum For Jaw-Dropping Date Night With Ciara -- See Pics!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/russell-wilson-shuts-down-seattle-art-museum-jaw-dropping-date-night-ciara-see-pics-86590", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/ciara_russell_wilson_getty547466864.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Russell Wilson Shuts Down Seattle Art Museum For Jaw-Dropping Date Night With Ciara -- See Pics! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Ciara, Russell Wilson", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 45, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
