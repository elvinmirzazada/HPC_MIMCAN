My heart is broken and it is beyond repair,\u201d Koretsky wrote. \u201cDolores is beautiful. Her art is beautiful. Her family is beautiful,\u201d he added. \u201cThe energy she continues to radiate is undeniable. I am lost. I miss her so much. I will continue to stumble around this planet for some time knowing well there\u2019s no real place for me here now.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Riordan is survived by her ex-husband, Don Burton, and her three children, Taylor Baxter, Molly Leigh and Dakota Rain.", "images":
