Jordan wreaked considerable damage in \u201cBlack Panther\u201d \u2014 on and off the screen.\n\nA teenage fan was so captivated by a scene featuring a shirtless Jordan that she bit down and broke her retainer, her orthodontist shared on Tumblr.\n\n\u201cOne of my patients came in for an emergency visit, because she snapped the wire on her retainer watching the movie when MBJ took his shirt off she clenched her teeth so f\u2013king hard she snapped it,\u201d the orthodontist, whose name was not listed, wrote in a post that\u2019s gone viral.\n\nMichael B. Jordan plays Killmonger in \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d\n\nSophia Robb, 18, then confirmed on Twitter that she\u2019s the fan the orthodontist was referring to.\n\n\u201cThis is litterally my orthodontist and he\u2019s the chillest person i have ever met even though he eXPOSED ME ON THE INTERNET,\u201d Robb wrote.\n\nJordan, who plays the villainous Killmonger in the movie, has since offered to get Robb a new retainer.\n\n\u201cSince I feel partly responsible for breaking your retainers let me know if I can replace them,\u201d Jordan, 31, posted to Twitter, along with a laughing emoji.\n\nRobb seems to be taking the whole situation in stride. She\u2019s retweeted and replied to a number of tweets referring to her story, and even updated her Twitter biography to read, \u201cI\u2019m the girl who broke her retainer over Michael B Jordan in Black Panther.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack Panther,\u201d which came out last month, has grossed over $920 million globally since its mid-February release, according to Forbes, and has won the domestic box office three weeks in a row.\n\nThe Ryan Coogler-directed film also stars Chadwick Boseman as the titular hero, as well as Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright and Daniel Kaluuya.", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/03/07/CLWXXMSOJXJ7NINZRIT6Z3SDTQ.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NYDN-LOGO-WHITE-J.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/03/07/CLWXXMSOJXJ7NINZRIT6Z3SDTQ.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sblendorio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/03/07/michael-b-jordan-fan-broke-her-retainer-after-seeing-him-shirtless-in-black-panther/", "title": "Michael B.
