Brosnahan shared a video of Kate dancing with her husband Andy Spade (brother of actor David Spade) with a big smile on her face as a mariachi band played in the background.\n\n\u201cKnowing Katy, this is how she would want to be remembered,\u201d wrote the 27-year-old actress. \u201cShe had a light that words can\u2019t capture but touched everyone she came into contact with. She was exceedingly kind, beautifully sensitive, insanely talented, funny as heck and one of the most generous people I have ever known. She was effervescent.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cHug your loved ones extra tight today.\u201d\n\nAfter Brosnahan won a Golden Globe for best performance by an actress in a television series, musical or comedy for her work in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel in January, Kate told Page Six that the family was \u201cinsanely proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am beside myself! My daughter and I jumped up and down when she won,\u201d the beloved handbag creator said. \u201cShe deserves this recognition, as she\u2019s put her heart and soul into the role. We are insanely proud.\u201d\n\nWalter McBride/Getty\n\nPolice confirmed Kate was found Tuesday morning in her bedroom at her and Andy\u2019s Park Avenue home in Manhattan. A housekeeper discovered her, according to a police source, and she left a suicide note.\n\n\u201cWe are all devastated by today\u2019s tragedy,\u201d her family said in a statement to the New York Daily News. \u201cWe loved Kate dearly and will miss her terribly. We would ask that our privacy be respected as we grieve during this very difficult time.\u201d\n\nWendy Maeda/The Boston Globe via Getty\n\nDavid Spade/Twitter\n\nDavid Spade also paid tribute to his sister-in-law on Instagram Tuesday, hours after news of her suicide was made public.\n\n\u201cFuzzy picture but I love it. Kate and I during Christmas family photos. We had so much fun that day. She was so sharp and quick on her feet. She could make me laugh so hard,\u201d wrote David.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s a rough world out there people, try to hang on,\u201d he added.\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).", "images":
