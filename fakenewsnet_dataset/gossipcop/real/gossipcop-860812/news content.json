The 19-year-old and her rumored (but, you know, practically confirmed) boyfriend, Travis Scott, showed off their new matching tattoos on Snapchat yesterday, and, though you have to squint to see them, they\u2019re actually kind of cute.\n\nThe couple, who sparked dating rumors after they were spotted getting cozy at Coachella in April, tatted tiny butterflies on their ankles in honor of their budding love. The insect might seem random for a til-death-do-us-part-style tat, but those who keep up with the reality star know what butterflies mean to her and her new beau.\n\nFor one, it\u2019s the emoji the pair uses when they want to *discreetly* express their love for each other. Second, it\u2019s also rumored Travis\u2019s song, \u201cButterfly Effect,\u201d is about Kylie after he Instagrammed a photo of her leaving a plane with the caption, \u201cButterfly Effect.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Kylie has gotten inked for a boyfriend, either. In December, the Kylie Cosmetics mogul debuted a tiny \u201ct\u201d on her ankle for her ex-boyfriend, Tyga, who Kylie dated for years until silently splitting in April\u2014around the same time she began seeing Travis.\n\nSo, this is when our wheels started turning. Kylie got a tiny tattoo on her ankle for Tyga. She got a tiny tattoo on her ankle for Travis. Either homegirl loves inking up her feet or something sus is going on. If you\u2019re struggling to read between the lines, we\u2019re throwing out the possibility that Kylie got her Travis tattoo on top of her Tyga one. Apparently, we\u2019re not the only ones who think so, either.\n\nWell, at least she was being resourceful.", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetabercrombiejeans.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kylie-jenner-travis-scott.jpg", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/zodiacsignsasvideogames_2-1.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1-Square.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/airpods-black-friday-deals.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mean-girls.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/irrational-found-renewed-season-2-nbc.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/khyreview.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-butterfly-tattoo.jpg?w=416", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/jamie-lynn.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetsweaterset.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kylie-jenner-travis-scott.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/daisy-jones-and-the-six.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/root-cover-up-fi.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RemiBader_Homepage.webp?w=244", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-butterfly-tattoo-2.jpg?w=401", "https://spy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sdfgve.png?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/beyonce.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uggdupestarget.gif?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/timmy-kylie-1.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Taylor-Swift.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/olivercabellsneakersale.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ChatGPT.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bestprodsforthinninghair.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/olivia-rodrigo-merch.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MS-S10_VTR10-Show-TP_00142_f.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/survivor-jeff-probst-smiling.jpg?resize=232,175"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kylie-jenner-travis-scott.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Pham"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/680931/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-matching-butterfly-tattoos/", "title": "Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott Got Matching Butterfly Tattoos", "meta_data": {"description": "Kylie Jenner and new boyfriend Travis Scott debuted their matching butterfly tattoos recently on Instagram.", "msvalidate.01": "7A34A1C1904BAFB83691E8B3718CA9A2", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/stylecaster", "published_time": "2017-06-13T15:30:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-04T15:09:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "yB_5UwT5pPNnn93Mba5HIaFkNtbrafDQWP_Rj34Iw08", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "author": "Jason Pham", "tags": "celebrity tattoos, kylie jenner, Travis Scott", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott Got Matching Butterfly Tattoos", "url": "https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/680931/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-matching-butterfly-tattoos/", "description": "She also has one for Tyga.", "site_name": "StyleCaster", "image": {"identifier": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kylie-jenner-travis-scott.jpg", "width": 650, "height": 366, "alt": "kylie-jenner-travis-scott"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"site": "@StyleCaster", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott Got Matching Butterfly Tattoos", "description": "Kylie Jenner and new boyfriend Travis Scott debuted their matching butterfly tattoos recently on Instagram.", "image": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kylie-jenner-travis-scott.jpg?w=650"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sc-favicon.png?w=67", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497367825.0, "source": "https://stylecaster.com", "summary": ""}
