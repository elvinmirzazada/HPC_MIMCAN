From meeting while Meghan was working as an actor to getting married, having two cute babies, and leaving the British royal family to be sorta normal, they\u2019ve been through it all. And even after facing tons of unfair scrutiny from the public and press, they only seem stronger\u2014I mean, last winter they legit just came out with a six-part Netflix docuseries that explores the entire span of their \u2019ship.\n\nSo while you\u2019re trying to figure out if you have a shot at running into them in Los Angeles, let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane and see how these two royals fell in love.\n\nOctober 31, 2016\n\nThe Sunday Express reports that Prince Harry has been secretly dating Suits star Meghan Markle. According to one source, Harry is \u201chappier than he\u2019s been for many years\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s definitely chemistry between them.\u201d\n\n\n\nGetty\n\nNovember 2, 2016\n\nBoth Toronto paper Star and Us Weekly report that Harry and Meghan attended a Halloween party together in Canada following a \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d situation at Heathrow Airport.

It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is \u2018the price she has to pay\u2019 and that \u2018this is all part of the game.\u2019 He strongly disagrees. This is not a game\u2014it is her life and his.\u201d\n\nDecember 7, 2016\n\nWhile at a flower shop in Toronto, Meghan is pictured wearing a necklace with the letters \u201cM\u201d and \u201cH.\u201d According to Entertainment Tonight, the 14-karat gold Maya Brenner Asymmetrical Letter necklace is $240, with an additional $60 for each letter.\n\nDecember 14, 2016\n\nMeghan and Harry are spotted holding hands in public for the first time after catching The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime on London\u2019s West End.

Following the ceremony, Harry reportedly drove straight to Kensington Palace, where Meghan had been staying for a few days, to pick up his date.

According to one source, Harry gave the ring about six weeks ago and Meghan has \u201chappily\u201d informed people on the set of Suits that it indeed is from the royal and that it\u2019s actually too big for her thumb. The ring is the latest piece of jewelry Harry has given his lady, joining a collection that includes a blue-and-white bracelet (which matches his own), a Cartier Love bracelet, a Maya Brenner necklace with the initials \u201cM\u201d and \u201cH,\u201d and a gold arrow ring.\n\nSeptember 5, 2017\n\nSpeaking to Vanity Fair in a rare interview, Meghan opens up about being \u201creally happy and in love\u201d with Harry. She also confirms that they met in July 2016 and managed to date under the radar for a few months before the press caught on.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that at the end of the day, I think it\u2019s really simple. We\u2019re two people who are really happy and in love. We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people\u2019s perception. Nothing about me changed. I\u2019m still the same person that I am, and I\u2019ve never defined myself by my relationship.\u201d\n\nIn the same interview, Meghan also says \u201cthere will be a time\u201d when they come forward and share more of their life together with the public, but for now, they want to keep things as private as possible. \u201cThis is for us. It\u2019s part of what makes it so special, that it\u2019s just ours. But we\u2019re happy.

But that\u2019s not why we\u2019re telling it. We\u2019re trusting our story to someone else, and that means it will go through their lens.\u201d The second installment of the Netflix show is slated to debut on December 15.\n\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\nHarry's tell-all book Spare comes out, and in it, the prince gives us all the deets about how he and Meghan first met after he was impressed by a pic of her online. Afterwards, apparently the Duchess of Sussex was the first to message him on Instagram.\n\n\"Eventually, we exchanged phone numbers, and mitigated the conversation over to text, going late into the night,\" Harry dishes in the project, adding that he was \"texting like a teenager\" through the next day.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex also highlights that it was \"uncanny,\" \"surreal,\" and \"bizarre\" that this convo with his now wife began on July 1, 2016\u2014aka what would have been his mother's fifty-fifth birthday. \ud83e\udd7a\u2764\ufe0f\n\nFor a bunch of other revelatory insights from Spare, check out this handy-dandy story:\n\nRelated Story The Biggest Revelations From Prince Harry\u2019s Memoir\n\nMarch 1, 2023\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Harry and Meghan are asked to leave their Frogmore Cottage home in England. The couple's rep confirms the news to Page Six, saying, \"We can confirm the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been requested to vacate their residence at Frogmore Cottage.\"\n\nAnd according to The Sun, Harry and Meghan were actually given notice of the eviction just 24 hours after the publication of Harry\u2019s memoir, Spare, in a move that is said to have left the duo \"stunned.\" Plus, on top of the already bombshell news, King Charles has allegedly offered the home to his disgraced brother Prince Andrew, which has us feeling all?!?!?!?!\n\nMarch 3, 2023\n\nIn much lighter news, the royal couple's bb girl Lilibet is christened by the Archbishop of Los Angeles, the Rev John Taylor, during an intimate ceremony at the couple's Montecito home.\n\nApparently, about 20-30 guests attend at the event, including Doria Ragland, Tyler Perry (who is Lilibet's godfather), and a godmother whose name has yet to be revealed. Oh, and apparently Tyler Perry pulls out all the stops for the royal baby's big day, flying in 10-person Gospel choir to sing \"Oh Happy Day\" and \"This Little Light of Mine\" at the event.\n\nOh, and before you ask\u2014yes, King Charles, Queen Camilla, Prince William and Kate Middleton were all invited. But, no, they were not in attendance. Whomp!\n\nMay 16, 2023\n\nHarry and Meghan face a \"near catastrophic car chase\" involving paparazzi in New York City, according to the Sussexes' spokesperson. The couple\u2014as well as the duchess\u2019s mother, Doria Ragland\u2014had just attended the Women of Vision Awards held at the Ziegfeld Ballroom, where Meghan was recognized as one of the ceremony\u2019s honorees.\n\n\"Last night, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Ms. Ragland were involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi,\" the couple\u2019s spokesperson relays in the statement. \"This relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians, and two NYPD officers,\" they add.\n\nLuckily, things end up alright; But the incident only fuels the duke's anger toward the press and paparazzi\u2014the latter of which pursued his mother, the late Princess Diana, in Paris in 1997 and caused her limousine to crash as she and her driver attempted to speed away.\n\nSeptember 2, 2023\n\nHarry and Meghan are all smiles during their time attending Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance Tour concert at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, where they're joined by some friends and even Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland.\n\nSeptember 14, 2023\n\nThe Duke of Sussex celebrates his 39th birthday during his trip to Germany for the sixth edition of his Invictus Games alongside Meghan, and to mark the special occasion, competitors and spectators at the volleyball game between Poland and Germany serenade Harry with a \ud83e\udd7a rendition of \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\nChris Jackson // Getty Images\n\n^A very happy Haz enjoying the singing.\n\nPlus, on the morning of the royal's actual birthday, the Invictus Games organizers show Harry tons of love on their Twitter X account:\n\n\n\nAnd that brings us up to date!
