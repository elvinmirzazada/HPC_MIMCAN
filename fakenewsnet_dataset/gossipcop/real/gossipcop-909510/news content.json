{"url": "https://www.self.com/story/jenna-dewan-tatum-interview", "text": "When I learned I'd be sitting down with dancer and actress Jenna Dewan Tatum at a Young Living Essential Oils event, I was incredibly excited (and, honestly, pretty nervous). I'd never interviewed a celebrity before, and on top of that, I've been a fan of Dewan Tatum's since she starred alongside now-husband Channing Tatum in the 2006 film Step Up. My appreciation for her has only grown in the years since, as she's openly discussed her sex life, killed it in lip-sync battles, and shared down-to-earth Instagram posts documenting her experiences as a new parent.\n\nWhether you've seen Dewan Tatum dance, watched one of her interviews, or talked with her in person, you know she's many things. Bright. Sweet. Fun. And above all else, confident. She radiates a kind of magnetic self-assurance that draws you in, and before you know it, you're asking her about things like awkward moments in the bedroom, risk-taking, and self-care. But everything she says circles back to one core idea: There's nothing more powerful than knowing who you are and pursuing what makes you feel happiest.\n\nWe begin our conversation by talking about self-love, and Dewan Tatum tells me she feels sexiest when she's in nature\u2014or when she's dancing.\n\nThis statement surprises me, but the way she explains it makes sense: Dancing and being in nature both allow her to feel more comfortable in her skin. \"When that side of myself is activated, I feel more earthy and connected to my body,\" Dewan Tatum says. She adds that dance, in particular, makes her feel like a more sensual person. \"It grounds me into my body and makes me feel confident, sexy, and ready to go,\" she says.", "images": ["https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/653fbcf64991ce915398cab5/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/653fe8bb8ce90538d8d3f0e5/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a68d4660d57890ac882b791/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6543f0dc16d1566ed34ff402/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6567769e0768ecfa3c838835/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/653abb8ed09bbeb5796b4961/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/653ff7f9673a3159f9e2dd68/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/61f2b0cd898b9838f51324f7/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/654d42ce4467283c3b154bc1/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif", "https://media.self.com/photos/65414b70645c731ff4c6260a/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/65664beb1748f5ef29b6a047/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6557dafaa76d764356679808/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Lindsey Lanquist"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/jenna-dewan-tatum-interview", "title": "Jenna Dewan Tatum: If You Haven\u2019t Had an Awkward Moment in Bed, You\u2019re Not Living", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Actress and dancer Jenna Dewan Tatum talks to SELF about first-time parenting, practicing self-care through fitness, and embracing awkward sex moments.", "id": "59b2dfb895f25105a11194a4", "keywords": "jenna dewan tatum,news,channing tatum,sex", "news_keywords": "jenna dewan tatum,news,channing tatum,sex", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59b2dfb895f25105a11194a4", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Actress and dancer Jenna Dewan Tatum talks to SELF about first-time parenting, practicing self-care through fitness, and embracing awkward sex moments.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif\"}", "og": {"description": "Jenna Dewan Tatum talks to SELF about embarrassing sex moments, practicing self-care through fitness, and more.", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "Jenna Dewan Tatum Shares How She Keeps Her Sex Life Exciting as a New Parent", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/jenna-dewan-tatum-interview"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-09-12T21:13:18.464Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-12T21:13:18.464Z", "author": "Lindsey Lanquist"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "Jenna Dewan Tatum talks to SELF about embarrassing sex moments, practicing self-care through fitness, and more.", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@SELFmagazine", "title": "Jenna Dewan Tatum Shares How She Keeps Her Sex Life Exciting as a New Parent"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59b84cadfd62025412d7e1ab/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Interview.gif"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169640983205651, "pages": 8908243810}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505250798.464, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
