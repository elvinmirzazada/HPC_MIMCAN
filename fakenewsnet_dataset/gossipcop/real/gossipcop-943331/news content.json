Davidson also confirmed that he had split from his longtime girlfriend Cazzie David in mid-May, around the same time he wrapped his fourth season performing on Saturday Night Live. He will reportedly return to the show when it resumes production in the fall.\n\n\u201cEveryone around them is super supportive and happy that they\u2019ve found love,\u201d a source told PEOPLE.\n\nAnd the newly engaged pair have also continued to support one another after they opened up about their respective hardships.\n\n\u201cHe went through a rough patch a while back but he\u2019s been really happy lately,\u201d the source said about Davidson, who recently revealed that he\u2019s back to drinking and smoking following his diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Davidson has also said he struggles with anxiety and Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nGrande previously said she\u2019s battled anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder since the bombing at the Manchester, U.K. concert venue where she was performing in May 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about because so many people have suffered such severe, tremendous loss,\u201d she told Vogue U.K. for their July issue.\n\n\u201cBut, yeah, it\u2019s a real thing. I know those families and my fans, and everyone there experienced a tremendous amount of it as well. Time is the biggest thing. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t even be talking about my own experience \u2014 like I shouldn\u2019t even say anything,\u201d Grande said.", "images":
