As LCD Soundsystem debuted new songs on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Russom could be spotted just over James Murphy\u2019s shoulder, lost in a groove. The band\u2019s resident synth and electronics wizard, who joined officially during the recording of 2010\u2019s This Is Happening, was wearing a T-shirt nodding at Octavia E. Butler\u2014the sci-fi pioneer whose Patternist series offering an alternate history of humankind had become a recent source of comfort for Russom.\n\n\u201cButler even uses the word transition to describe this moment in the Patternists\u2019 lives: They have these latent powers and then suddenly something would shift where their process accelerated,\u201d Russom says. \u201cA lot of that felt like what happened to me. Over the last year and a half, I went from my trans identity being something I was in touch with and worked through in one way or another, to suddenly this shift where it\u2019s on the front burner. Now it's time to become a whole person.\u201d\n\nAfter touring and recording with LCD Soundsystem last year, Russom took time off to focus on her own self-care, ultimately finding support in New York City\u2019s large and diverse community of trans women. The step-by-step process has led Russom here: \u201cA new photo that reflects how I feel comfortable expressing myself, feminine pronouns, and I'm using my old name.\u201d\n\nHer name carries clout in the electronic music world. Over the last two decades, Russom established herself by creating custom analog synthesizers for Murphy\u2019s DFA Records, as well as via her musical output with Delia Gonzalez and the Crystal Ark. As a solo performer, most often under the moniker Black Meteoric Star, Russom\u2019s heavy acid-house and techno bubbles with the fire and creativity of early Detroit acts.\n\nOn July 13th, the eve of LCD\u2019s headlining set at Pitchfork Music Festival, Russom will DJ publicly for the first time as a trans woman during Femme\u2019s Room, a popular monthly party celebrating femme and queer culture. Russom was asked to DJ the event, held at Chicago\u2019s Berlin nightclub, before the organizers knew she was trans. \u201cHaving not said anything about my gender identity or transition, it felt like this amazing synchronicity,\u201d she says, \u201cone of those moments where the universe is tapping you on the shoulder, [saying], \u2018It's OK, it's real.\u2019\u201d", "images": ["https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/65650af2633df4edd044b041/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/655e27fbc11e0c9805adf513/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/595e424ffd29f43ecf9b48a6/2:1/w_2560%2Cc_limit/gavin3.jpg", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/595e424ffd29f43ecf9b48a6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gavin3.jpg", "https://pitchfork.com/verso/static/pitchfork/assets/logo-inverted.svg", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/655782d2cacdf631c6466895/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/654d0130c768987b5824da5d/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/654668dec1dfc8098dc98908/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://pitchfork.com/verso/static/pitchfork/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/654d32f6d88beea000ded193/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/656232dc541e60a52416c642/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://pitchfork.com/verso/static/pitchfork/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/6564fbafb66dccc38e538e15/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/65661d94a6112b5af6e6ac23/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/6543c3016b41e5ad826f56da/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/65578a974887360ad375ad46/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/595e424ffd29f43ecf9b48a6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gavin3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Britt Julious"], "canonical_link": "https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/lcd-soundsystems-gavin-russom-comes-out-as-transgender-interview/", "title": "LCD Soundsystem\u2019s Gavin Russom On Coming Out as Transgender", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "\u201cNow it\u2019s time to become a whole person,\u201d says DFA Records\u2019 longtime synth expert", "id": "595d63759096f5296ff8592a", "keywords": "as told to,lgbtq", "news_keywords": "as told to,lgbtq", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "595d63759096f5296ff8592a", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"\u201cNow it\u2019s time to become a whole person,\u201d says DFA Records\u2019 longtime synth expert\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/595e424ffd29f43ecf9b48a6/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/gavin3.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/595e424ffd29f43ecf9b48a6/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/gavin3.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\u201cNow it\u2019s time to become a whole person,\u201d says DFA Records\u2019 longtime synth expert", "image": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/595e424ffd29f43ecf9b48a6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gavin3.jpg", "site_name": "Pitchfork", "title": "LCD Soundsystem\u2019s Gavin Russom On Coming Out as Transgender", "type": "article", "url": "https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/lcd-soundsystems-gavin-russom-comes-out-as-transgender-interview/"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-07-06T15:57:45.321Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-06T15:57:45.321Z", "author": "Britt Julious"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@pitchfork", "description": "\u201cNow it\u2019s time to become a whole person,\u201d says DFA Records\u2019 longtime synth expert", "domain": "https://pitchfork.com", "image": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/595e424ffd29f43ecf9b48a6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gavin3.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@pitchfork", "title": "LCD Soundsystem\u2019s Gavin Russom On Coming Out as Transgender"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/595e424ffd29f43ecf9b48a6/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/gavin3.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 207089362687909, "pages": 28015075999}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499356665.321, "source": "https://pitchfork.com", "summary": ""}
