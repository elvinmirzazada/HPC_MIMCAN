Chrissy began the letter by telling her younger self that she is \"just as important and beautiful\" as the most popular girl from her school, before delving into why it's essential she stop comparing herself to others.\n\n\"Contrary to the bill of goods you\u2019ve been sold, life is not a competition,\" she wrote. \"Stop comparing yourself to anyone or anything.\"\n\n\"We are all on our own journey and YOU are the driver,\" she continued. \"There will be bumps in the road, detours to be taken and pit stops will have to be made, but you\u2019ve got to fill \u2018er up and keep going. You will lose your map, but never your intuition.\"\n\nThat's right, y'all: Chrissy is just as capable of making you sob IRL as she is on This Is Us. You can read the rest of her beautiful letter right here.\n\nFollow Gina on Twitter.\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/chrissy-1492704237.jpg?resize=640:*",
