On Nov. 2, Rodriguez wrote a touching post about her love for Ronaldo, who is the father of her first child.\n\n\"What a special day! Let's toast for now without alcohol and instead with your well-deserved trophies. For all of your effort, dedication, sacrifice, and so many hours of training to be at another level. Your life is soccer, and this is clearly reflected on the field. Keep being like this, always striving, and I'll be here by your side, supporting you, giving you love, tranquility and all that you need when you get home,\" wrote Rodriguez.\n\nThe Spanish model also told her 32-year-old athlete boyfriend that in good times or in bad times, she would be there for him. \"We love and admire you, champion,\" she said.\n\nRodriguez wrote the note on Wednesday night, after the end of the Tottenham game. Although she did not reference the Spurs score in her note, it was clear that she was celebrating the recent achievement of her partner, as she attached a photo from the most recent FIFA Best Awards to her message.\n\nIt can be recalled that on Wednesday night, the Spurs earned their spot in the knockout phase of the Champions League after winning at 3-1 over Real Madrid. Currently, Ronaldo is Champions League's top scorer with a total of six goals in four games.\n\nRonaldo has three children who now treat Rodriguez as their stepmother. His oldest son is Cristiano Ronaldo, Jr. Over the last summer, he had two new twins, Eva and Mateo Ronaldo. Just last week, Ronaldo and Rodriguez took to Instagram to share that their new baby will be named Alana Martina.", "images":
