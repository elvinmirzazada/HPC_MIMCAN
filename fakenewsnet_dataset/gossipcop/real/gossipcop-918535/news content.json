In a year, if they\u2019re both single, they\u2019ll hook up with each other in what could become one of the unlikeliest celebrity pairings ever. Haddish, the breakout star of Girls Trip, made the revelation during an interview with Kelly Ripa at the 2018 Academy Awards as they played a round of \u201cMarry, Date or Dish,\u201d E! News reports.\n\nTiffany said that she met Angelina Jolie\u2019s estranged husband by chance in an elevator that night.\n\n\u201cOh I just met him an the elevator, he said in one year if he\u2019s single and I\u2019m single we gonna do it, so you know what that means,\u201d Haddish said.\n\n\u201cBut he do got seven kids, I don\u2019t know if I could deal with a man that\u2019s got that many kids.\u201d\n\nFor the record, Brad Pitt has six kids with Jolie.\n\nAs for hook up predictions for Brad Pitt, Tiffany Haddish needs to get in line. Since the public breakup of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux\u2019s marriage, there have been lots of rumors that Aniston is going to reunite with her ex-husband.\n\nHaddish received loads of attention at the Oscars. Her dress on the red carpet was one of the night\u2019s standout ensembles. As CNN reports, Tiffany wore a zuria, which is a type of dress native to Eritrea, her father\u2019s homeland. During an interview on the red carpet, Tiffany said her now-deceased father made her promise to pay homage to Eritrea if she ever ended up at The Oscars.\n\n\u201cHe said one day I would end up here, and if I ever end up at the Oscars to honor my people,\u201d she said of her dress choice.\n\nThe decision went over well with viewers on social media, with many Eritreans expressing pride at their culture being represented on the Academy Awards\u2019 red carpet.\n\nI'm usually with the #BoycottTheOscars & #OscarsSoWhite teams\u2026but #ERITREA represented by @TiffanyHaddish at #Oscars2018 was too ?????? to avoid! It's so much more than a dress for us, it's the #eritreastolemyheart narrative vs. distorted \"analysis\" spewed by the media!! pic.twitter.com/CFsY5KdkZJ \u2014 Milena Bereket (@0to1infinity) March 5, 2018\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only Tiffany Haddish gown that got attention. Later that night, she changed into a white Alexander Mcqueen number to present an award and do a comedy bit with SNL alum, Maya Rudolph. During her own stint as an SNL host last year, Tiffany swore that she would wear the dress multiple times because it cost more than her mortgage. Haddish and Rudolph\u2019s comedy stole the show as they delivered lines that triggered laughs from the audience and were a hit on social media as well. There were even calls for them to host The Oscars next year.\n\nRemarkable human Tiffany Haddish now has worn the same dress three times like she said she would https://t.co/BtGLupX71L pic.twitter.com/mATCiAi4D3 \u2014 BuzzFeed (@BuzzFeed) March 5, 2018\n\nHaddish has definitely extended the 15 minutes of fame she received as the breakout star of Girls Trip into an enviable career. Ever since the movie broke box office records, she\u2019s put out a best selling book, hosted a comedy special on Showtime and appeared in Superbowl commercials for Groupon. This year, she\u2019ll host the MTV Movie And TV Awards. Will she one day add a gig as the host of The Academy Awards to her growing resume? We\u2019ll have to wait and see. As Tiffany would say, \u201cShe Ready!\u201d", "images": ["https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/inquisitr_cross.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v3/assets/search-icon.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patricia Grannum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4814631/tiffany-haddish-and-brad-pitt-agreed-to-hook-up-if-theyre-single-in-2019-girls-trip-star-reveals", "title": "Tiffany Haddish And Brad Pitt Agreed To Hook Up If They\u2019re Single In 2019, The \u2018Girls Trip\u2019 Star Reveals", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Tiffany Haddish and Brad Pitt have an agreement.
