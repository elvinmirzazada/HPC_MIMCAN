As reported by E!, during a special interview with Vanity Fair, Ross was asked questions about having kids where she bluntly made it clear that some boundaries need to be set and not everything is up for discussion when it comes to her personal and private life. The cover model and actress sat down with the magazine and gave her thoughts on how she feels constantly being asked about whether she plans on having kids or not. Back in 2016 and 2017 for example, Ross, who was promoting the third season of her show Black-ish was constantly asked whether the 45-year-old ever plans on having kids.\n\nBecause Ross\u2019 character in the series was expecting her fifth child, she was often asked whether she ever wanted to become a mother in real life.\n\n\u201cLast year, I was pregnant all season. That brought on a lot of comments and questions and pontifications from people with no invitation.\u201d\n\nThe former model and actress told the magazine that she was forced to shut down the questions in a no-nonsense way, pretty much telling everyone to back off.\n\n\u201cI literally have said to people, for real, no joke, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just get out of my womb? Like, get out of my uterus. What are you doing in there? And why are you asking those questions? And what makes you think you can ask that?'\u201d\n\nAccording to the actress, patriarchy has created a \u201csiloed-off experience\u201d for women\u2014not just actresses\u2014\u201dwith one answer for what a good life looks like.\u201d\n\nRoss, whose mother is none other than the one and only Diana Ross, grew up with what many could say was a unique model of what it means to be a woman. Of her mother, Ross says, \u201cI saw a woman who just was making a path and doing it on her own. She didn\u2019t have hundreds of people doing everything for her\u2014my mom always packed her own bags and cooked our food. She was doing it all and never had the response to me\u2026 where she was like, \u2018Not now, I don\u2019t have time.\u2019 It was very capable, incredibly capable and present at the same time.\u201d\n\nWith her mother as her role model, Ross has used her mother\u2019s example to take control of her career as an actress and even as a director saying, \u201cMy mother is a woman who completely possessed her own agency and embodied a sense of her own power, unapologetically. I think that lends itself to directing. I don\u2019t have a fear in making a choice or expressing my opinion even if no one else likes it\u2014or not even expressing it, but owning it for myself.\u201d\n\nAside from owning her power as an actress and director, Ross is also paying attention and making sure she getting what she\u2019s rightfully worth. Earlier this year, news broke that Ross earned less money than her male co-star, Anthony Anderson.\n\nOf the news going public Ross told the magazine, \u201cThat was really f\u2013king awkward. I don\u2019t know how that information got out. But I understand the interest because there is a larger, deeper, more important conversation going on that is not about me, but is about people being paid appropriately for their contribution and the work that they do, not because of their gender, race, or anything. And it is a valid, real, important, past-due conversation that should no longer be a conversation, that should just be handled\u2026across all industries.\u201d\n\nRoss, once again making sure to set boundaries, has hired a new team of female agents and prefers not to talk about the pay disparity simply saying,\u201dThat has been resolved.\u201d", "images": ["https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/inquisitr_cross.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v3/assets/search-icon.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tiffani Cordner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4931815/tracee-ellis-ross-shuts-down-baby-questions-telling-people-to-get-out-of-her-womb", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross Shuts Down Baby Questions Telling People To \u2018Get Out\u2019 Of Her Womb", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Tracee Ellis Ross may be the superstar daughter of singer Diana Ross, but she&#8217;s letting fans know that that doesn&#8217;t give them a pass to pry in her personal life.
