One week after learning that this collection of thirtysomethings are more connected than we initially thought \u2014 Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) are the parents of the Big Three, a.k.a. Kate (Chrissy Metz), Kevin (Justin Hartley) and Randall (Sterling K. Brown) \u2014 we discovered that William (Ron Cephas Jones) was secretly feeding a cat! Nope, that\u2019s not it. That Kevin was kissing off Hollywood and moving to New York to do theater! Also interesting, but not what we\u2019re talking about. That we opened the episode with a flashback not immediately after the birth of the Big Three but eight years later, scattering our bearings all over the place? That was a disorienting delight, but that\u2019s not it either. What was it? Oh, right: Our patriarch and matriarch \u2014 the loving foundation of this family \u2014 are no longer together.\n\nWhen Jack was struggling with his parental responsibilities and nursing a few too many bourbons at the local bar, his best friend, Miguel (Castle alum Jon Huertas) was right there to tell Jack to take stock of his many blessings at home, especially his attractive wife (whose derriere he complimented), and he noted that he was \u201cjealous\u201d of their relationship. After Jack ambled home and Rebecca dropped a rather devastating speech about his increasingly distant role as a parent (\u201cI\u2019m done letting you lower our score\u201d), Jack sobered up in all senses of the word, vowed to quit drinking, and gave her a moon necklace, to which she promised, \u201cI\u2019m never going to take it off.\u201d And so things returned to happy\u2026 right up until the end of the episode, when the doorbell at Randall\u2019s house rang and one of his children announced, \u201cGrandma and Grandpa are here!'\u201d Oh, Grandma was there all right, wearing her moon necklace as promised. But it turns out that this Grandpa was actually Miguel.\n\nEnd of episode. Beginning of anxious questions.\n\nAllow This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman to break down that cliffhanger and preview what\u2019s to come.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: You walloped us again.\n\nDAN FOGELMAN: The ending is a real mystery: What the f\u2014 happened there? Did the issues that obviously plagued their marriage like any couple catch up with them? Did something else happen? Was there a divorce? Did somebody cheat? Did somebody die? What is the story there?\n\nGiven that we bought Jack and Rebecca as the epic love story at the center of the show up until now, what can you hint about their relationship in future episodes?\n\nTheir marriage in the series, or the first season of the show, is a real marriage with ups and downs. The show is always hopeful, even though it\u2019s heavy and not everything is perfect. It\u2019s fair to say that there can be sadness and sad endings to things for these two, but I think as their love story goes, it\u2019s a hopeful and romantic one, too. Every week is not a slog watching those people from the pilot turn bad. They\u2019re in love in the way that people fall in love in movies. It\u2019s soulmate kind of stuff, right? But that\u2019s not to say they can\u2019t separate, or divorce, or die. But at the end of whatever their journey is \u2014 and we haven\u2019t even gotten there yet \u2014 I like to think that great love still exists at the end of it, wherever it ended.\n\nWhen you\u2019re watching, part of you immediately feels protective of Jack, thinks back on the episode and wonders, \u201cWas this guy honing in on Rebecca? Or was he a great guy who comforted her after he was out of the picture?\u201d\n\nOne hundred percent. I think the audience will now be guessing what happened, and there\u2019s more to it all than that. Even the questions we\u2019ve asked right now, there\u2019s going to be different questions that come later. I think that in this show, no one\u2019s evil and no one\u2019s out to do bad, but everybody\u2019s flawed because we\u2019re all human, right? But the feelings are real. People are really in love, and people are really trying to do the right thing, even when things are crumbling\u2026 There\u2019s stuff that\u2019s gone on here. It doesn\u2019t mean it was dark, depraved s\u2014, but stuff has happened. And so I think that\u2019s part of the journey for the audience, is watching that unfold.\n\nRELATED: Hear why This is Us is one of fall\u2019s best new shows\n\nWhen will we get more answers about Rebecca ending up with Miguel? Is it something where you drop that bomb and then we don\u2019t revisit that for episodes to come?\n\nOr potentially a season, even. There\u2019s a typical device in an episode of television, where you start with a scene that seems crazy and then you go 48 hours earlier and you rewind, and then you see the whole episode\u2019s about how did these normal characters get to this crazy place? We\u2019re doing that on a kind of big, macro level. We go: I know this ending piece \u2014 or this middle piece as it might turn out to be. Now I\u2019m going to go on this journey with the show for a season that\u2019s going to get me from, \u201cHow did that happen in episode 2 of this show,\u201d and it\u2019s going to get me all the way there in the course of the season.\n\nSo fair to say we will have to hold tight for a bit before we get more answers on that question.\n\nI think so. There are some questions that are going to be not answered for seasons, and it\u2019ll always make sense. We\u2019re being very careful not to do something and then say \u201cOh, s\u2014, that doesn\u2019t make sense with what we\u2019re going to be doing later,\u201d but there are some questions in the series. Otherwise we\u2019re just unfolding too much stuff too quickly. It\u2019s that fine line where you also want to satisfy and not frustrate. But yeah, how people got together, we\u2019re really going to play that.\n\nNEXT: About that moon necklace\u2026[pagebreak]\n\nShould we read the fact that she\u2019s wearing the moon necklace as a sign of their connection? That maybe things didn\u2019t end in divorce or so bitterly?\n\nI think we should. It\u2019s a \u201cWhoa.\u201d But now you\u2019re very curious how it happened. I think if you watch the show and you love the show and people are starting to find it already in such a big way, I think you can feel the heart of the show. And I think it should give the audience comfort that the characters are going to make terrible mistakes, the characters are going to do bad things, but at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t have a dark view of people and there\u2019s deep love everywhere.\n\nRandall\u2019s \u201cHey, Miguel\u201d was a little chillier than his \u201cHey, Mom!\u201d Do you want the audience to study his reaction?\n\nI think so. Sterling\u2019s so great because I made him do this 150 times because it was such an important ending. You wouldn\u2019t describe it as cold, you would describe it as slightly less warm than he greets his own mother, which is kind of how we greet step-people. It\u2019s not mean. But I think different characters have different reactions to Miguel in the show as we move forward. Randall is probably the most tolerant. He lives the closest by, but there\u2019s still a little bit of awkward distance in that dance, because as you learn about when this all happened and how it all happened, it\u2019s uncomfortable. We\u2019re left wondering: \u201cWere there affairs? Did a marriage break apart? Did Jack somehow pass away? Did something else happen?\u201d So you learn it as it goes.\n\nWhat was Jon\u2019s reaction when you told him he\u2019d be.. the other guy?\n\nWhen Jon was cast, he came in knowing where that character was going. The biggest surprise for Mandy and Jon was, \u201cOh, you\u2019re also going to be playing that [older] version of yourself.\u201d That was something that Mandy didn\u2019t know. I was like, \u201cOh and Mandy, we\u2019re going to try to do something crazy here.\u201d She was totally game\u2026 My promise to her was if we don\u2019t get it right, we have what we call a ripping-the-parachute cord, and we were also simultaneously saying, \u201cDo we need to do something else?\u201d Our makeup team and hair team just blew me away, and I was so happy with what they did, so that locked in a couple weeks before we shot it.\n\nWill we see present-day Jack, too?\n\nHe\u2019s game. I mean, what better thing for an actor? What scarier thing for an actor? We haven\u2019t shot old Milo yet\u2026. Both Mandy and Milo strangely can float through different periods easily, and it feels very authentic.\n\nWilliam didn\u2019t seem eager to greet Randall\u2019s mother at the door.\n\nI think the read right now is that he wants to give Randall a moment without bombarding his adoptive parents with his biological father. Coming next week we\u2019re going to learn that it\u2019s a little more than that.\n\nWhat can you tease about episode 3?\n\nIt will be the first time we explore young William. We go back to the birth of the family, we go back to that time period where we start the pilot and a lot of secrets are revealed. And there\u2019s something very visceral about the episode in a different way than the first two have been, which are also really emotional and fulfilling. It\u2019s crazy.\n\nTo read what Mandy Moore and Milo Ventimiglia said about the big reveal in episode 2, click here.", "images":
