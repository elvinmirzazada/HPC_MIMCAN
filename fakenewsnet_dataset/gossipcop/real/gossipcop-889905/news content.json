That\u2019s it,\u201d she told TODAY\u2019s Savannah Guthrie in an interview clip that aired Friday. \u201cI guess I got to the point where it was really kind of life or death.\u201d\n\nGomez revealed she had the transplant in an Instagram post that included a photo of her and Ra\u00edsa, 29, holding hands and lying in side-by-side hospital beds following their surgeries.\n\nThere are two types of lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease. One form, discoid lupus, only affects the skin. Systemic lupus erythematosus, however, harms the skin, joints, kidneys and brain and may be fatal, according to the National Kidney Foundation.\n\nGomez told TODAY that she was reluctant to seek a donor after learning she needed a transplant to save her life.\n\n\u201cMy kidneys were just done. That was it and I didn't want to ask a single person in my life,\u201d she told Savannah. \u201cAnd she volunteered and did it.\"\n\nRa\u00edsa, who starred in the series, \u201cSecret Life of the American Teenager\u201d and, more recently, on \u201cDear White People,\" first met Gomez about a decade ago at a charity event organized by Disney and ABC Family.\n\nGomez treated her lupus with chemotherapy in 2014. She also took time off last year to deal with anxiety, panic attacks and depression prompted by the disease.\n\nHer full interview with TODAY airs on Monday and Tuesday.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201710/tdy_health_azar_shingles_171026_1920x1080.today-vid-canonical-small-desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201710/tdy_news_hallie_trump_opioid_1771026_1920x1080.today-vid-canonical-small-desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201710/tdy_news_guth_selena_preview_171027_1920x1080.today-inline-vid-featured-desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754im_/https://c.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2017_43/1291804/selena-francia-today-tease3-171027_85c8a74be590c8856d92c59b06888428.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_06/405876/1c6213516-tdy-130225-eun-kim-mug_e41ef688c0312678ecd0fcb1d6aadfde.today-byline.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201710/tdy_pop_klg_chat_football_171026_1920x1080.today-vid-canonical-small-desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754im_/https://nodeassets.today.com/cdnassets/today-images/svg/video-play-white.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201710/tdy_mk_tellingmytruth_171026_1920x1080.today-vid-canonical-small-desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754im_/https://nodeassets.today.com/cdnassets/today-images/tdy-header-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2017_43/1291804/selena-francia-today-tease3-171027_85c8a74be590c8856d92c59b06888428.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eun Kyung Kim"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754/https://www.today.com/health/selena-gomez-francia-raisa-open-about-kidney-transplant-nbc-news-t118050", "title": "Selena Gomez and Francia Ra\u00edsa open up about kidney transplant in NBC News exclusive", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width initial-scale=1 maximum-scale=1 user-scalable=no", "msvalidate.01": "43434ADDF3F60D7897F819F388E2FADF", "author": "Eun Kyung Kim", "og": {"description": "The pop star speaks about her appreciation for the friend who donated a kidney to her in a clip from an upcoming exclusive interview.", "title": "Selena Gomez and Francia Ra\u00edsa open up about kidney transplant in NBC News exclusive", "site_name": "TODAY.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2017_43/1291804/selena-francia-today-tease3-171027_85c8a74be590c8856d92c59b06888428.jpg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171027151754/https://www.today.com/health/selena-gomez-francia-raisa-open-about-kidney-transplant-nbc-news-t118050"}, "description": "The pop star speaks about her appreciation for the friend who donated a kidney to her in a clip from an upcoming exclusive interview.", "twitter": {"title": "Selena Gomez and Francia Ra\u00edsa open up about kidney transplant in NBC News exclusive", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TodayShow", "description": "The pop star speaks about her appreciation for the friend who donated a kidney to her in a clip from an upcoming exclusive interview.", "creator": "@TodayShow", "domain": "TODAY.com", "image": {"src": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_43/1291804/selena-francia-today-tease3-171027_85c8a74be590c8856d92c59b06888428.today-inline-vid-featured-desktop.jpg"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "parsely-post-id": 118050, "news_keywords": "Savannah Guthrie,On the show,Health & Wellness,Health", "google-site-verification": "uDRXhvw8LRHhorJhIUmXCkUPjqGebM6KFh9jZGwH6VA", "DC.date.issued": "2017-10-27T11:32:00.000Z", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699, affiliate-data=ct=todaycom_sb&pt=211554, app-argument=https://www.today.com/health/selena-gomez-francia-raisa-open-about-kidney-transplant-nbc-news-t118050"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
