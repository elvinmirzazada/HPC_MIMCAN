But that\u2019s only fitting for this family, isn\u2019t it? On Tuesday night, This Is Us delivered a fall finale packed, as one might have imagined it would be, with a few twists and turns. The biggest, though, came when Kevin discovered that Jack\u2019s brother, Nicky, did not, in fact, die in Vietnam. Instead, it appears Nicky is alive and well, and living in a home with a lot of wood paneling.\n\nFans also finally discovered the identity of the female character who appears to be sick in the show\u2019s future timeline\u2014not Beth but apparently Rebecca, who in all fairness would be well into her golden years by this stage in the story. Plus, Randall and Beth are now on the rocks, and Kate and Toby are having a boy.\n\nThere are still plenty of mysteries new and old to be solved when the series returns in January\u2014and in an interview with Deadline, This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman broke them all down.\n\nWhat\u2019s the deal with Uncle Nicky?\n\nWhen asked what, exactly, Nicky has been up to\u2014and whether he\u2019s been in hiding this whole time\u2014Fogelman demurred that the story is \u201ccomplicated.\u201d (No kidding.) But he did say that we\u2019ll learn what happened between Nicky and Jack very quickly upon the show\u2019s return in January. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to be told, and it\u2019s coming very soon,\u201d Fogelman said. But don\u2019t think that means we\u2019ll necessarily know all the answers by the end of the season: \u201cI\u2019m just saying the big mystery questions are answered pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nIn terms of how that story is told, it appears Kevin will remain front and center in moving that plot forward\u2014especially once he rejoins the Pearson family in the States.\n\nDid Randall just screw things up with Beth for good?\n\nThings are not looking good for this show\u2019s most solid couple. After Randall prioritized his campaign over an increasingly complicated homelife\u2014a daughter who just came out; an adoptive daughter who wants to re-establish contact with her birth mother\u2014Beth banished him to the couch. But will this estrangement last into the future?\n\n\u201cI will say that Randall and Beth, and Sterling and Susan, have some heavy-duty stuff coming up in the back half of this season, which I\u2019ve already read, written, and seen,\u201d Fogelman said. \u201cThe couple has been incredible throughout the series, and they\u2019re a couple that people have really taken to. The back half of the season is a real showcase for them.\u201d\n\nHe added that there will be a Beth-centric episode in the season\u2019s back half, so perhaps Beth will finally get the backstory treatment that almost every other character on this show has already enjoyed. As for their marriage, it sounds like, at the very least, there are rough waters ahead\u2014especially given the glimpse we saw of Beth receiving a call from Randall in the future, and not necessarily looking overjoyed to hear from him.\n\nWhat in the world is this show going to do to Rebecca?\n\nNow that we know it\u2019s Rebecca and not Beth who\u2019s getting a visit from Randall and Tess, we\u2019re left to wonder what\u2019s going on with the Pearson matriarch. That mystery has been the slowest to unspool this season\u2014a pacing choice that seems unlikely to change.\n\n\u201cIn terms of where they\u2019re going [to see her, in the future], and what\u2019s going on there, I think other stories move forward and center, and some of those answers will spread out towards the end of this season and into the next ones,\u201d Fogelman said. \u201cThis is all part of a very long, complex, complicated plan that we\u2019ve really had since go. It\u2019s one of those situations where it\u2019s not just been cooked up overnight; it\u2019s part of the premise of this entire thing, so sometimes things get teased [in the future], but there are other answers being given in the present day that inform those things when you get to them. So a certain amount of things need to happen before you get there, to fully understand it.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bfe9942b44a1a2d726093e7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/this-is-us-season-3-nicky-alive-rebecca-sick-randall-beth-divorce.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6564cb9e766ac2eb76f98953/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660159ee60bb2d438ba5ff/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6549039ac95dc1d504c2a596/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654a9970e140c2ae66a21f2b/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bfe9942b44a1a2d726093e7/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/this-is-us-season-3-nicky-alive-rebecca-sick-randall-beth-divorce.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655cc086cf71d0d44adc5f3a/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1ddfa6e74086397a5fa219/1:1/pass/NUP_180092_2923.JPG", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6553ae4223927aad8fa808b3/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a135c98787cb12d25d3e88c/1:1/pass/NUP_180091_0997.JPG", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/654d1186e7036cae589a91fb/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6553e7f6b8161e6f4de402ed/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59ef9aef2cf5042e35429f56/1:1/pass/NUP_179601_2205.JPG", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65565cab811fa04e15f2edc3/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/656510d0affa7b4408631071/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bfe9942b44a1a2d726093e7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/this-is-us-season-3-nicky-alive-rebecca-sick-randall-beth-divorce.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Laura Bradley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/this-is-us-season-3-nicky-alive-rebecca-sick-randall-beth-divorce-kate-toby-baby", "title": "This Is Us Creator Dan Fogelman Breaks Down that Shocking Nicky Twist", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": ". . .
