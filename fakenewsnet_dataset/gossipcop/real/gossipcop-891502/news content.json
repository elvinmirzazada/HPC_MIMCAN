All are due early next year.\n\n\u201cOh here, I can feel where this is going. She\u2019s trying to trick me into confirming pregnancies,\u201d Jenner said of DeGeneres.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/gettyimages-500272358.jpg?crop=0px%2C85px%2C2249px%2C1505px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kris-jenner-99-cent-store.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/amber-portwood.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/sheree-whitfield.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/the-tonight-show-harvey-relief.jpg?crop=537px%2C20px%2C914px%2C611px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/frank-underwood-b.jpg?crop=0px%2C454px%2C1944px%2C1301px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/90-day-fiance.jpg?crop=198px%2C42px%2C1106px%2C740px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sabrina-limon-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/lisa-bonet-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C23px%2C1600px%2C1071px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://people.com/tv/kris-jenner-ellen-degeneres-99-cents-only-store-prank/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kevin-spacey1.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C1402px%2C937px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kris-jenner-99-cent-store.jpg?w=2000&h=1099"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kris-jenner-99-cent-store.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104072025/http://people.com/tv/kris-jenner-ellen-degeneres-99-cents-only-store-prank/", "title": "Kris Jenner Hilariously Sent to a Dollar Store by Ellen DeGeneres", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1143086910", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyHr0dwzD_U Kris Jenner\u00a0gets\u00a0a commission from her famous daughters' business deals, thus making her a bonafide millionaire.
