Diddy, Puffy, Puff Daddy, etc.) revealed Monday evening on Instagram he was \u201cwas only joking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, ladies and gentlemen, today I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that you cannot play around with the internet,\u201d Diddy said after opening with a line from Lionel Richie\u2019s \u201cHello.\u201d \u201cDue to the overwhelming response from the media out there, and just due to there not wanting to be any confusion\u2026 I was only joking. Okay? I didn\u2019t change my name. It was just part of one of my alter egos. One of my alter egos is Love.\u201d\n\nAnd to make things even less confusing, he says he\u2019s fine being called any of his former monikers. \u201cTo set the record straight, because I have a lot of press to do in the next couple of weeks, you can address me by any of my older names. But, if you still wanna call me Love, you can call me Love, baby. But, I was only playing.\u201d\n\nDiddy was telling a very different tune over the weekend, though. \u201cI have some very serious news,\u201d said the rapper and King of Marketing in a video on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019ve been praying on this and\u2026 I knew it was risky, \u2019cause it could come off as corny to some people, [but] I decided to change my name again\u2026 I\u2019m just not who I am before. I\u2019m something different. So my new name is Love, a.k.a. Brother Love. I will not be answering to Puffy, Diddy, Puff Daddy, or any of my other monikers but Love or Brother Love.\u201d\n\nThe 48-year-old mogul \u2014 and this year\u2019s highest-paid celebrity \u2014 has obviously gone through many a name change over the years, with Forbes pointing out that the name changes correspond with the release of a new album. His sixth (and rumored to be final) studio album No Way Out 2 is due for a December release. Here\u2019s to Love! Er, Diddy?", "images": ["https://ew.com/thmb/TLyjngHFzSAgWBc-nnHSeVlqFrY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lil-Tay-080923-61da0f2fece54434805ae574d50399e1.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/TV2EFpxUMQuhfuXrDZ0MBonR7Wc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-103321353-6ad4db26333b4fb8b09284efa5cd6976.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/EcslpE5WXqNZQsDcgQr0zyf_7y4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Diddy-cf19712e6eeb4551b57c29385b00e5f0.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/pkGEV13M1Up6_nyrSZmO8eSSFWY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cardi-b-takeoff-111222-2000-8f0415574c7c4f3ebe6494697bea6fc7.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/BJJTgWQtk73AI3xCMycfZZkyk3s=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sean-Combs-0b745e2bcd934c168aa0e79008564d62.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/OMsVwbFTQgZ8AOgzvTIdHRwWKAY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/placeholderimage-e2715228ea5b42a5ab6fead459dbcd35.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/4inAKMlAcf5-V-0nRtrQ5yERw_E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gettyimages-145011869-2000-5fd43866557c4769a67372b84d810ddc.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/LtO0nijS5T1amqXUUriK20z8Z3A=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1405332123-0cf5e4d6a6e445e290d6c06d019d37d7.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/Uge2-kxyrI-vDsI8m9PKozvbZqU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/diddy-forthcoming-album-082223-cdb3cae3845347a4ac28749b33b133b0.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/bLvm05kw8OHoeBltNR9DVKkANqg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sean-Diddy-Combs-100223-ea702930b4014ebcbecc2ec101143110.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/BWzv5kMIJPl-Y-n3Rpsp5rs2paQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lionel-Richie-Kenny-Rogers-033023-2de8c25a0dea4b819dfe5f2663ab3b6f.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/8rswqauhRsTGymDKb0DfHSzxhXc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Diddy-Kim-Porter-091523-2000-37d3f3a7c92148059b98462a5d4935d4.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/g8Cz5d1ilDS1oeOiMppaP_Irm9w=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gettyimages-115330193-b1bf42d9dec1468dbc827f3f2cfa8059.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/8Wwc8iLz3lbbMWyeIGkTaIx-8is=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/puff_l-3-0a154477191b4d599810b7b4fa119723.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/CSQLSuy3nYidHcigayt-niabyCc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/p_l-72b353a295514569b387efd7377834b0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ew.com/thmb/4inAKMlAcf5-V-0nRtrQ5yERw_E=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gettyimages-145011869-2000-5fd43866557c4769a67372b84d810ddc.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/music/2017/11/06/diddy-changes-name-to-brother-love/", "title": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs 'was only joking' about changing name to Brother Love", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The rapper and mogul announced over the weekend on Twitter that he changed his name, but now he says he was 'only playing' in a new video on Instagram.", "parsely-section": "Music", "parsely-tags": "Celebrity,People,Music,Sean P.
