Six winter Olympians hail from Steamboat Springs, Colorado, but the city with the most Olympians is Park City, Utah, which has eight athletes to cheer for this year.\n\nAccording to NPR, sunny California comes in second, with 22 athletes. Six of the 14 American Olympic figure skaters hail from the Golden State.\n\nOne of those Californian Olympians is bobsledder Carlo Valdes. Valdes tells CNBC Make It that the secret to athletic success is confidence.\n\n\"You always have to go in there confident,\" he says. \"Work hard, keep your head down and always control what you can control. If you focus on those things, you'll be very successful.\"\n\nCalifornian figure skater Mirai Nagasu agrees. \"When someone really, truly believes in themselves, magic happens,\" she tells CNBC Make It. \"The possibilities are endless.\"\n\nDisclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics. NBC Olympics is the U.S. broadcast rights holder to all Summer and Winter Games through the year 2032.\n\nLike this story?
