We both entered the public eye in our early 20s and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships.\u201d\n\nMariano Vivanco\n\nThe singer also got candid about her own uncomfortable experiences in Hollywood, revealing she was asked early on in her career by a \u201cdirector to take off my shirt and show my boobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut did I do it? No, I did not,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I did speak up, I was terrified. I remember my heart beating out of my chest, thinking, \u2018What did I do? This man is hiring me! It was one of my first movies. But in my mind I knew the behavior wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nMariano Vivanco\n\nAnd after thriving for decades in a difficult industry, the star says she has no plans to slow down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one of those media darlings. I didn\u2019t get kissed into this business. I\u2019m from the Bronx,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to find my way, so I\u2019ve always felt like I had to prove myself. Maybe that\u2019s a good drive to have. I never settle for mediocre.\u201d", "images":
