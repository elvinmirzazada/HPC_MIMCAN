The event comes a few days after Harry and his fiancee's first official royal event in Nottingham after announcing their engagement. But while Meghan has now officially relocated to the UK and is living in the Nottingham Cottage in Kensington Palace with her royal beau, she was absent from tonight's service. Instead, Harry\u2019s former girlfriend Cressida Bonas showed she had no hard feelings for her former flame as she arrived at the church tonight,\n\nCONSTANT MEDIA - PA Prince Harry and ex-Cressida attend carol concert without Meghan\n\nCressida - the youngest daughter of 1960s \u201cIt girl\u201d Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon - looked elegant as she arrived at the service in a blue velvet wrap car with a leopard print collar with her mother. The 28-year-old actress and model was romantically involved with Harry from 2012 until 2014, when they split amicably. She was introduced to Prince Harry by Princess Eugenie, the youngest daughter of Prince Andrew \u2013 the Queen\u2019s third child. There were rumours that Harry might propose to Cressida before their split but the relationship ended and Prince Harry is now preparing to marry Meghan.\n\nCONSTANT MEDIA Cressida was romantically involved with Harry from 2012 until 2014\n\nCONSTANT MEDIA Cressida Bonas showed she had no hard feelings for her former flame\n\nBecome an Express Premium member Support fearless journalism\n\nSupport fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online, advert free\n\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-day\n\nFREE trial\n\nAlso in attendance this evening were Carole Middleton and her daughter Pippa Matthews, the younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge. The mother and daughter are both regulars at the concert having attended regularly since it began 15 years ago. The charity, which uniquely has both William and his brother Prince Harry as patrons, was set up in memory of their friend, who died in a car crash in 2002. Since Henry's death, the foundation set up in his memory has raised enough money to support the education of more than 26,000 children in 39 schools across Uganda.", "images":
