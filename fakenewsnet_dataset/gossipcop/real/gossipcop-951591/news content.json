He filed for divorce before they were introduced,\u201d the source says about Super, who met de Lesseps through a mutual friend.\n\nSuper \u2014 who joined The Gersh Agency in the comedy department in January 2017, according to Deadline \u2014 has \u201cbeen navigating lots of new opportunities\u201d for de Lesseps, who has \u201cdone 16 cabaret shows all over the country with more requests flooding in,\u201d the source explains.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very new, but like most things with Luann, it\u2019s been all-consuming. They only started working together a few months ago. He was reluctant to sign her at first because of The Housewives, but her work ethic surprised him in many ways and sealed the deal. They\u2019ve been a great team since,\u201d a second source tells PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cTheir chemistry was instant. He\u2019s very aggressive and she goes toe-to-toe with him. You can tell they\u2019re having a lot of fun together,\u201d says the second source, who adds that, \u201cthey\u2019re very hot and heavy together.\u201d\n\nThe second source shares, \u201cLuann\u2019s happy to have something lighthearted in her life after all the drama of the past year. And his marriage was over before they met, so it\u2019s been good for him to move on.\u201d\n\nDe Lesseps\u2019 new relationship comes nearly a year after her divorce from ex-husband Tom D\u2019Agostino Jr. was finalized.\n\nShe wed D\u2019Agostino on Dec. 31, 2016, in a lavish, three-day celebration in Palm Beach, Florida, attended by several friends of the bride from the Housewives franchise. The couple announced their split in August 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cWe care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!\u201d\n\nDe Lesseps later told PEOPLE that \u201cthis has been one of the toughest times of my life.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Luann de Lesseps Says Her Arrest Cost Her Friends and Boyfriends\n\nA year after tying the knot with D\u2019Agostino, de Lesseps was arrested on Christmas Eve 2017 in Palm Beach, Florida, and charged with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant. (She\u2019s since pleaded not guilty and rejected a plea deal in February.)\n\nShe later apologized for the incident, admitting that being back in Palm Beach for the first time since she wed D\u2019Agostino before divorcing him seventh months later had \u201cbrought up long-buried emotions.\u201d\n\nShe entered a treatment facility and began focusing on her personal wellbeing.\n\nAhead of the July 4 holiday, the Bravo star spent time with her first husband Count Alexandre de Lesseps, to whom she was married for 16 years, and their two kids \u2014 Noel and Victoria \u2014 and celebrated six months of sobriety.\n\n\u201cGreatest reunion ever!\u201d she captioned a photo, taken in Sag Harbor, New York, of her and the Count.\n\n\u201cWonderful to spend the weekend with the kids and The Count. Also counting my blessings!\u201d she continued. \u201cCelebrating 6 months of sobriety! Happy 4th of July, everyone! @noeldelesseps @victoriadelesseps #onedayatatime #lovemyfamily #grateful #rhony #countess.\u201d\n\nDe lesseps, who debuted her #CountessAndFriends cabaret show at New York City\u2019s Feinstein\u2019s/54 Below in February, will be performing at the Paramount on Aug. 4 and the Borgata on Aug. 24; tickets are available on CountessLuann.com.\n\nPage Six first reported
