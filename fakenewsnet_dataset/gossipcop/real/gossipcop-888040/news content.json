My journey with these women finally begins and it\u2019s been quite a roller coaster.\n\nIs There a Rocky Road Ahead For Melissa and Teresa?\n\nI have to say first and foremost, after seeing everything Teresa and Melissa have been through, it\u2019s amazing to see how far they have come! Family dynamics can be complicated and there\u2019s no one method to the madness. Because each family is unique, you have to figure out what works for you- and sometimes there\u2019s a lot of trial and error that\u2019s involved and that\u2019s OK! I can totally relate to Teresa. Sometimes, when you know your parents are feeling low, you expect your siblings to help and contribute, to help bring them back up, to make them feel important and special. A little bit of love goes a long way, so let\u2019s keep the love flowing people!\n\nTeresa is so disciplined over this fitness competition. I know she says it\u2019s a huge stress reliever for her, but for me, just the thought of working out is a stress creator - I sweat just thinking about it! Wait, can that count as a workout? Lol! I love the idea of a fitness competition but it stops there. I\u2019m not that ambitious! I don\u2019t think I would even have the discipline. I just don\u2019t want it bad enough. Plus Bill will hate me on stage in a bikini. Come to think of it, so would I!\n\nAnd I love the fact that Marge is such a fierce business woman! I would love to have my own business or even businesses in the future! Hey, it\u2019s good to set goals! And I love her idea about the pajamas and I see her point that she works from home and wants to stay in her comfy jammies, but isn\u2019t it ironic that she sleeps naked?! #TMI! But all kidding aside, I\u2019d love a new pair of pajamas! hint, hint ;)\n\nI love Dolores and Frank\u2019s relationship! They are amazing roles models of how divorced couples should behave! And could it be that\u2019s Frank\u2019s hinting for another chance? I think that ship has sailed Frank! Your relationship seems healthy as it is and if it ain\u2019t broke!... And Frankie Jr., do your mom a solid and go visit her! Mama bears always need some love!\n\nDolores Calls Danielle a 'Troublemaker'\n\nSpeaking of Marge and Dolores, can I get a high five on how cool they are now?! Let\u2019s take notes people, life is too short to hold grudges and I love how they\u2019re in a good place. I\u2019m more worried about how Dolores is going to react to Danielle! Paterson Dolores scares me!\n\nAnd can I just wish Melissa a happy, happy birthday?! This party is at the coolest place ever, Rails! I can\u2019t wait to bring my kids here (I have five, ya know). And everyone seems to be having a blast, especially tipsy Melissy! And how super cute is Jackie! I think Melissa found her drinking buddy! Not me though, I\u2019m a water girl...with ice!\n\nArranged Marriages and Chaperoned Dates?!\n\nI love telling all the girls my story about how I met my husband. It\u2019s true that I didn\u2019t like the guy my parents originally set me up with. They persuaded me to go to a wedding in California, hoping that I would warm up to the guy. And my husband happened to be the best man at this wedding, which was for his brother. And when he walked down the aisle to get to his position as the best man, (he is the Best Man, by the way), it\u2019s true...the light bulb flew on and I knew he was the one for me. We knew the drill when we first went out. We already knew we were attracted to each other, we already knew each other\u2018s families and our backgrounds. At this point, we just needed to go out to see if we got along. And on our second date, he told me how he knew I was going to be his wife one day and I just happily agreed. By the third date, he was introducing me as his fianc\u00e9e to all of his friends. When his friends asked where is my engagement ring, he simply responded, \u201cMy dad is in the jewelry business and her dad is in the jewelry business, the ring is easy!\u201d By the 4th date, he was telling me how his cousins wanted to meet me because they wanted to be bridesmaids in my wedding. I didn\u2019t even want bridesmaids at my wedding, but I was so infatuated with him that I just happily agreed to everything he said! He has never proposed! We met the Sunday before Labor Day 2001 and we got married exactly one year to the day, the Sunday before Labor Day 2002. I had 600 people at my wedding! It was at the Westmount Country club and it wasn\u2019t just a wedding, it was the event of the year!\n\nI had limos, a Rolls Royce, a horse and buggy, even sparkler fireworks shot out through the centerpieces during our first dance, and three different singers! And yes peeps, you buy the cow if you want the milk! We waited till marriage so it would be special. And I didn\u2019t need a trial run, because it\u2019s all in the kiss. If the kiss is good, you know it\u2019ll be smooth sailing. If you got a lizard trying to swallow your thyroid, then you know it\u2019s NG! (No Good)! And it\u2019s been 15 years and five kids later, I think it\u2019s safe to say that it all worked out!\n\nNow getting back to Melissa\u2019s party, can I just say how beautiful the cake is! I think it\u2019s so great that she doesn\u2019t take her self too seriously! Cake is ending up everywhere and nobody cares! There\u2019s drinking, jumping, throwing and guess what, it\u2019s all good! As Tipsy Melissy says, \u201cLet them throw cake!\u201d", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/06/jennifer-aydin-bill-aydin-pool-house.jpg?itok=Lsv3Fw40",
