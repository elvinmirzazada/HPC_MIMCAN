(Black Friday falls on November 26.) However, deals are already live at all retailers on several big-ticket products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat tech deals will Cyber Monday offer?\n\nRight now, we're seeing early Cyber Monday deals on video games, smartwatches, and robot vacuums among other items. It's an especially good time to get items like smart speakers, TVs, tablets, streaming players, and Apple devices for less.\n\nWhat stores participate in Cyber Monday tech deals?\n\nPretty much any large retailer that sells electronics is taking part in early Cyber Monday festivities. Best Buy, Walmart, Amazon, and Target are the biggest players, but you can also expect equally good deals from stores like Adorama, B&H, and Microcenter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich has better tech deals, Black Friday or Cyber Monday?\n\nBoth holidays offer extremely rare and worthwhile deals, but Cyber Monday is better known for deals on laptops, Apple devices, headphones, gaming, and the like.\n\nBlack Friday is better known for home and kitchen appliance deals, but it does often feature excellent discounts on tech like smart speakers, TVs, smart bulbs, and tablets.\n\nAnother feature of Cyber Monday is that, as the name suggests, it's almost entirely online. Black Friday is famously shoppable both online and in-stores, sometimes with exclusive deals limited to one or the other. If you prefer shopping from the comfort of your desk chair, Cyber Monday may be the best for you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat tech deals did we see during Cyber Monday last year?\n\nLast year, Cyber Monday brought huge discounts on AirPods, gaming console controllers, Amazon Echo speakers, Kindle e-readers, TVs, smartwatches, robot vacuums, and much more.\n\nHow we select the best Cyber Monday
