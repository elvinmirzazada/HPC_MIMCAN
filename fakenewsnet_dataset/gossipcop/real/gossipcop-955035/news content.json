If you\u2019re not waxing a bad arch or over-tweezing, you\u2019re letting stragglers grow wild, or worse, developing a unibrow. Ew. So we asked an eyebrow expert, Joey Healy, what we really need to know about grooming brows. Here he clears up four myths about eyebrows, things even we confess to believing.\n\nGet The Perfect Summer Brows\n\nMyth 1: Tweezing, waxing, and threading all cause hair to grow back differently.\n\nIn all instances, hair follicles are being removed from the root. \u201cWhile I have a strong preference toward tweezing in terms of creating the best shape, this method will not result in different hair re-growth than waxing or threading,\u201d says Joey, who is New York City-based. Each method rids hair for approximately four weeks, which is the average time it takes for eyebrow hair to reach the surface of the skin.\n\nMyth 2: Your eyebrows should match your hair color.\n\nCould you picture Marilyn Monroe without her signature, chocolate brown eyebrows? Neither can we. Eyebrow color can, and should, vary. \u201cFor example, most Asian women fair best with a soft charcoal toned brow, not one that matches their jet black, raven hair,\u201d says Joey.\n\nHis key tip here is to assess your hair color\u2019s undertone,\u2013warm, neutral, or cool\u2013 then match your brows with an unobtrusive color in that range. The idea is to assess your entire complexion and make sure your brows seem appropriately impactful.\n\nDoes The Carpet Match The Drapes?\n\nMyth 3: Never remove hair from above the eyebrow.\n\n\u201cSome will preach that you must never tweeze the hair above the eyebrow, only beneath,\u201d says Joey. But \u201cfollowing this outdated rule will leave the brow shape looking unfinished.\u201d That said, most of the shaping should come from underneath to lift the brow up; if too much is plucked from above, it can flatten it, resulting in a scowling effect. Joey recommends using your best judgment when working above the brow, but sticking to a quick clean up.\n\nGet The Look: A 3-Minute Topknot\n\nMyth 4: If you\u2019ve over-plucked, your eyebrows won\u2019t grow back.\n\nFor a healthy young adult, the average time for tweezed hair to grow back is 56 days. As a licensed esthetician, Joey says that excessive plucking, rubbing eyebrows from habit, or applying aggressive skincare treatments can cause eyebrows to fall out. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doomed. In times like these, Joey recommends Joey Healy Brow Renovation Serum ($125, Joeyhealy.com), which regenerates eyebrow growth. Basically, it works by increasing the amount and length of hair that grows during your eyebrow\u2019s growth phase, and slows down their natural shedding process.\n\nAny eyebrow myths we missed?", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetabercrombiejeans.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ncis-sydney-1x03-evie-deshawn.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/brow-glue.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/root-cover-up-fi.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/143087265-cropped-proto-custom_9.jpg", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kleemorganicseyecream.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/target-sweater.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/These-Drugstore-Products-Fully-Restored-My-Over-Plucked-Brows-in-30-Days.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lush-advent-cal.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ytp-eye-cream-fi.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Hillary-and-Abortion.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/best-clothing-sales-right-now-2.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/143087265-cropped-proto-custom_9.jpg?w=320&h=360&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2012/06/143087265-cropped-proto-custom_141.jpg", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetsweaterset.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/chat-gpt-open-ai.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/daisy-jones-and-the-six.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RemiBader_Homepage.webp?w=244", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nativaspa-cyber-monday.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://spy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sdfgve.png?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ulta-hair-sale.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uggdupestarget.gif?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Penelope-Cruz-Oscar.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/olivercabellsneakersale.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bestprodsforthinninghair.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/143087265-cropped-proto-custom_9.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caroline Murray"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/beauty/skin-care/577117/the-4-biggest-eyebrow-myths-debunked/", "title": "The Four Biggest Eyebrow Myths, Debunked", "meta_data": {"description": "Always battling it out with your brows?
