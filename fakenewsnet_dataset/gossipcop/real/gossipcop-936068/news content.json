You\u2019re perfect and I love you most,\u201d continued the Bachelor in Paradise bartender, 34, adding that the birthday festivities were only getting started. \u201cNow pack your bags, cus baby, we\u2019re jumping on a plane and heading down to the islands tomorrow!\u201d\n\nWells Adams/Instagram\n\nThe post quickly won the affections of not only Hyland, but also former Bachelor star Ben Higgins.\n\n\u201cI really like you two people,\u201d he wrote underneath the loving birthday message, to which Adams replied, \u201cWe love you more.\u201d\n\nIn her own comment, Hyland made her love for her boyfriend abundantly clear, writing, \u201cYou\u2019re the central perk I need every morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you so much baby,\u201d she continued, adding three kiss face emojis.\n\nWells Adams/Instagram\n\nHyland, who spent part of the day re-posting kind birthday messages from her friends, also gave Adams a special shout-out on her Instagram Story.\n\n\u201cI love this one the most,\u201d she wrote alongside one of the images he shared of the couple.\n\nWells Adams and Sarah Hyland. Sarah Hyland/Instagram\n\nAdams shared the exact same sentiment with the star last month, when the couple celebrated their one-year anniversary.\n\nAlthough the Modern Family star shared on social media that she spent the day \u201cdoing nothing,\u201d which she said felt \u201camazing,\u201d the couple invited a few pals over to their home that night to celebrate her big day.\n\nShowing off one of the gifts she received that night, Hyland posted photos of a pair of custom sweatshirts she\u2019d been given for both her and Adams to wear.\n\nBoth sweatshirts featured the same photo of the couple posing together on a boat, but each featured a different affectionate nickname.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m with smoochie booty bear cutie,\u201d Adams\u2019 sweatshirt proclaims, while Hyland\u2019s says, \u201cI\u2019m with big daddy jungle kitty.\u201d\n\nSarah Hyland/Instagram\n\nSarah Hyland/Instagram\n\nHowever, there was one guest who left the festivities a little early \u2014 and departed without saying goodbye to the birthday girl!\n\nClearly feeling a little guilty for making an \u201cIrish exit\u201d so he could grab some rest before their big trip, Adams apologized to Hyland the next morning.\n\n\u201cI want to publicly apologize,\u201d he said in a video shared to his Instagram Story, which was recorded while the couple were resting in bed next to each other.\n\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Hyland replied, with a sleep mask still covering her eyes.\n\n\u201cI left the party without saying goodbye and went to bed,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you are apologizing,\u201d she remarked while moving to cuddle up against him.\n\nFor their first anniversary in October, the couple dedicated sweet posts to each other on Instagram.\n\n\u201cA year ago I impatiently asked @wellsadams \u2018when are you gonna ask me to be your girlfriend?!\u2019 I still can\u2019t tell if I just bullied you into being with me and you\u2019re scared to leave? But please don\u2019t,\u201d wrote Hyland. \u201cThank you for being the @stevehowey to my @katehudson in #bridewars \u2026 Now, let\u2019s get tan again and drink all the ros\u00e9.\u201d\n\nAdams also shared a slideshow of candid selfies of the couple smiling and kissing.\n\n\u201cA couple hours after we took these pics, @sarahhyland said \u2018when are you going to ask me to be your girlfriend.\u2019 I said, \u2018right now,\u2019 \u201d he revealed. \u201cI then doubled down and said \u2018I\u2019m falling in love with you.\u2019 She responded with, \u2018I can\u2019t say that yet.\u2019 And then like 15 minutes later she did. Happy anniversary, baby. I love you most.\u201d\n\nThe actress and Adams began flirting on Twitter last summer during his stint as the bartender in Bachelor in Paradise \u2014 but Hyland had been vocal about her not-so-secret crush on the radio DJ since his time vying for JoJo Fletcher\u2018s heart on season 12 of The Bachelorette in 2016.\n\nTaking their relationship to the next step, the pair officially moved in together this summer, with Adams relocating from Nashville to Los Angeles to be with the actress.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s brought us closer,\u201d Hyland told PEOPLE in August.", "images":
