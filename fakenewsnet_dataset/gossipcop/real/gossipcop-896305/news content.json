{"url": "https://people.com/music/big-sean-tweet-after-naya-rivera-arrest/", "text": "Shortly after his former fianc\u00e9e Naya Rivera was arrested and charged with misdemeanor domestic battery following an alleged altercation with her husband Ryan Dorsey in West Virginia on Saturday night, Big Sean seemingly responded to the news by shading his ex on Twitter.\n\nJust before midnight on Saturday, the rapper, 29, tweeted a video of a little girl emphatically saying, \u201cI told y\u2019all n\u2014\u2013. I told y\u2019all n\u2014\u2013. Y\u2019all thought I was playing, but I told y\u2019all n\u2014\u2013.\u201d\n\nThe Glee actress, 30, first started dating the musician in the spring of 2013 and the duo announced their engagement just six months later. But in April 2014, Big Sean \u2014 who is now dating Jhen\u00e9 Aiko \u2014 broke off their engagement and Rivera claimed in her memoir Sorry Not Sorry that she found out she was no longer getting married from the Internet.\n\nGregg DeGuire/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nOn Saturday night, a deputy responded to a domestic violence complaint in Chesapeake, West Virginia, authorities said. Dorsey claimed to the responding deputy that Rivera struck him in the head and face. He had minor injuries consistent with his claims, and further showed authorities a video taken during the alleged incident.\n\n\u201cWhile we will not release details of the incident beyond what is in the criminal complaint (charging document), we will say the two were arguing over their child,\u201d Sgt. B.D. Humphreys of the Kanawha County Sheriff\u2019s Office told PEOPLE Sunday afternoon, adding that Dorsey \u201cdid not require medical attention\u201d after the alleged incident.\n\nCourtesy of Kanawha County Sheriff's Office\n\nAfter posting the video on Twitter, fans flooded Big Sean\u2019s timeline with a mixture of reactions.\n\nRivera married Dorsey \u2014 with whom she shares 2-year-old son Josey \u2014 three months after her engagement with Big Sean was called off. Dorsey, 34, and Rivera first dated in 2010 before going their separate ways while she starred on Glee.\n\nJust over a year after tying the knot, Rivera announced that she and Dorsey were getting divorced.\n\n\u201cAfter much consideration, we have made the decision to end our marriage,\u201d the couple told PEOPLE in a statement. \u201cOur priority is and always will be our beautiful son that we share together. We will continue to be great co-parenting partners for him. We ask for respect and privacy for our family during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nGregg DeGuire/WireImage\n\nLast month, however, Rivera briefly opened up to PEOPLE about reuniting with Dorsey, saying \u201cIt is what it is, but I\u2019m glad that my family is together,\u201d adding that the reconciliation was a \u201cpersonal decision.\u201d", "images":
