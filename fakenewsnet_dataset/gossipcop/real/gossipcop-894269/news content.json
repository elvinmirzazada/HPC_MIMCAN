This was no small feat because their grandma is Ms. Diana Ross, and yet it happened. After performing a medley of some of her biggest hits, Ms. Ross began calling her grandkids up to the stage one at a time. One of the first to arrive was Jagger Snow Ross, daughter of Evan Ross and Ashlee Simpson. She marked the momentous occasion by picking her nose on stage.\n\nThen came Raif-Henok Emmanuel Kendrick, son of Rhonda Ross, who busted out a series of dance moves that would make Bruno Mars jealous.\n\nAnother of Ms. Ross's grandkids, Callaway, presented her grandma with the beloved fanny pack she recently lost while shopping at Marshall's. (If you haven't heard that story, please take a few minutes and let Tracee Ellis Ross catch you up.)\n\nRaif also got another moment in the spotlight at the very end of the show, when he indicated he had a message he'd like to send to everyone. \"I am so proud of you,\" he said to his grandma, then added \"I love you all too\" for the audience. He then read off the official goodnight from the teleprompter (while another Ross grandkid picked her nose). Does Ashlee Simpson really know how lucky she is?\n\nFollow Eliza on Twitter and Cosmo Celeb on Facebook.", "images":
