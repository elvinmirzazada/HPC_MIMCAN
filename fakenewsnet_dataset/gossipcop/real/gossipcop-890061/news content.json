As much as we wish he was here with us, we know family comes first. So our thoughts are with you, Matt, and much love from your friends here in LA,\" she said, before a pre-recorded message from Damon appeared on screen.\n\n\"Hello and thank you to everyone at BAFTA,\" he said in a message after being celebrated by Julianne Moore, Paul Greengrass, George Clooney and more. \"I found out about this award six months ago and I was just so incredibly honored to receive it and I was really looking forward to tonight. Unfortunately, I had to go back to Boston for a family emergency. I'm really sorry not to be with you tonight. Thank you for this wonderful honor and I hope you have a lovely evening. See you soon.\"\n\nDamon faced another family emergency in April, when his daughter was stung by a jellyfish while he and his family were vacationing with Chris Hemsworth in Australia.\n\nHear the actor recount the scary event on Ellen in the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fet_showclips_mattdamon_090617.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2014-02%2F425_matt_damon_130812_176226071.jpg%3Fh%3D5306a394&w=1024&q=100", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2014-02/425_matt_damon_130812_176226071.jpg?h=5306a394", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fmatt_damon_george_clooney_jimmy_kimmel_youtube.jpg%3Fh%3D5c0d22e0&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2014-02/425_matt_damon_130812_176226071.jpg?h=5306a394", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/matt-damon-unable-attend-britannia-awards-due-family-emergency-90043", "title": "Matt Damon Unable to Attend Britannia Awards Due to 'Family Emergency'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2014-02/425_matt_damon_130812_176226071.jpg?h=5306a394", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 47-year-old actor was honored with the Stanley Kubrick Award for Excellence in Film at the 2017 BAFTA Britannia Awards on Friday.", "title": "Matt Damon Unable to Attend Britannia Awards Due to 'Family Emergency'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/matt-damon-unable-attend-britannia-awards-due-family-emergency-90043", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 47-year-old actor was honored with the Stanley Kubrick Award for Excellence in Film at the 2017 BAFTA Britannia Awards on Friday.", "twitter": {"description": "The 47-year-old actor was honored with the Stanley Kubrick Award for Excellence in Film at the 2017 BAFTA Britannia Awards on Friday.", "title": "Matt Damon Unable to Attend Britannia Awards Due to 'Family Emergency'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/matt-damon-unable-attend-britannia-awards-due-family-emergency-90043", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2014-02/425_matt_damon_130812_176226071.jpg?h=5306a394", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Matt Damon Unable to Attend Britannia Awards Due to 'Family Emergency'  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, Awards, Matt Damon", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
