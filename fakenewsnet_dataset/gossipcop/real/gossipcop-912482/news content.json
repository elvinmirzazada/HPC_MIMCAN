Comments That Don\u2019t Help in the Aftermath of a Hurricane\u201d has sold hundreds of thousands of copies and raised more than $1.25 million for such charities as Foundation for the Carolinas and World Central Kitchen. The contributions come from author proceeds and from the publisher, Simon & Schuster.\n\nBooks can take years from conception to publication, but \u201cWhose Boat Is This Boat?\u201d was essentially written in 24 hours and within six weeks was already on shelves, physical and virtual. It began after Trump visited New Bern, North Carolina, and was preoccupied with a yacht that had landed in a resident\u2019s backyard.\n\n\u201cTo see what we\u2019re seeing \u2014 this boat. I don\u2019t know what happened, but this boat just came here,\u201d he said. Other comments included \u201cAt least you got a nice boat out of the deal\u201d and \u201cHave a good time!\u201d\n\n\u201cLate Show\u201d staff writer Emmy Blotnick heard Trump\u2019s remarks and said, \u201cThat sounds like a children\u2019s book.\u201d\n\nWith illustrations by Audro Buneta and John Henry, \u201cWhose Boat Is This Boat?\u201d looks like a bedtime story, albeit one that ends with the message \u201cThere is no moral.\u201d Defining it has proved challenging: On The New York Times best-seller charts, it appears under \u201cAdvice, How-to & Miscellaneous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should be on the nonfiction list,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cI smell a rat.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Times spokesperson, \u201cThe book was placed on the advice, how-to and miscellaneous list where many books that defy easy categorization have ranked. It\u2019s a great achievement being on this highly competitive list for six weeks, including a week at No. 1, and we wish Stephen were happier about it.\u201d\n\nColbert said the book is for \u201cchildren of all ages,\u201d one that appeals to kids because it\u2019s \u201cpretty to look at, no nudity, no violence\u201d and one that shows adults how \u201cour president responds\u201d to natural disasters. The book is billed as \u201can excellent teaching tool\u201d that lets readers learn \u201cabout empathy by process of elimination.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose Boat Is This Boat?\u201d isn\u2019t the first picture story to mock the Trump administration. \u201cLast Week Tonight with John Oliver Presents a Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo\u201d is a best-selling parody of \u201cMarlon Bundo\u2019s Day in the Life of a Vice President,\u201d a tribute to the family\u2019s pet bunny written by Mike Pence\u2019s daughter, Charlotte Pence, and illustrated by his wife, Karen Pence. The vice president is known for his conservative social views; in Oliver\u2019s book, Marlon Bundo has fallen for a fellow male bunny.\n\nCharlotte Pence herself bought a copy of the Oliver edition, noting that proceeds went to charity. Colbert senses he may have similar luck with Trump and his family.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing, from the voices inside my head, is that he enjoys it,\u201d Colbert said, mimicking the president\u2019s own fact-checking style. \u201cEverybody is saying he likes it.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20181221024815im_/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-content/themes/jt_theme/library/img/japantimes-logo2.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221024815im_/https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/f-colbert-a-20181222-870x700.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221024815im_/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-content/themes/jt_theme/library/img/search.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221024815im_/https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/f-marshall-a-20181220-128x128.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221024815im_/https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/f-weinstein-a-20181222-128x128.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221024815im_/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-content/themes/jt_theme/library/img/japantimes-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221024815im_/https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/f-colbert-a-20181222-200x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221024815im_/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-content/themes/jt_theme/library/img/weather_icons/all-icons_33.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221024815im_/https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/f-cyntoia-a-20181219-128x128.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221024815im_/https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/f-colbert-a-20181222-870x700.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221024815/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2018/12/21/entertainment-news/no-moral-stephen-colbert-says-trump-spoof-book-whose-boat-boat-wrote/", "title": "\u2018There is no moral\u2019: Stephen Colbert says Trump spoof book \u2018Whose Boat is This Boat?\u2019 wrote itself", "meta_data": {"verify-v1": "+h35BdFddo/f1upXot92yGKSB4d5EuWWGbARz9SJE6A=", "twitter": {"account_id": 7424642, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221024815im_/https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/f-colbert-a-20181222-870x489.jpg", "site": "@japantimes", "creator": "@japantimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Japan Times", "robots": "noodp", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/f-colbert-a-20181222-200x200.jpg", "description": "For Stephen Colbert and his \"Late Night\" staff, the best-selling spoof \"Whose Boat Is This Boat?\" essentially wrote itself.
