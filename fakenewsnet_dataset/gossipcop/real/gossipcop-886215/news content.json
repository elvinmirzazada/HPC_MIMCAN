I rarely cry but this was something different, something I\u2019ve yet to experience watching someone else\u2019s story,\" he continued.\n\n\"I\u2019m proud of you partner!\" he added. \"They can say what they want but you\u2019re a star and I wouldn\u2019t want to be on this rollercoaster with anyone but you!\"\n\nLachey and Chmerkovskiy spoke with ET's Cameron Mathison after Monday night's performance, where she also complimented her ballroom partner.\n\n\"You channel it, you know?\u201d Lachey revealed about her emotions after the show. \u201c[Maks] is a great teacher, and I listen as the student \u2018cause this is not something I do \u2013 ballroom dance. He taught me a rumba. I have never moved my hips like that before in my entire life.\u201d\n\nThe mom of three also shared an Instagram, thanking Chmerkovskiy for his choreography and teachings.\n\n\"It was a Beautiful & Magical night full of so much Love. Thank You @maksimc for this dance,\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nThe love fest comes after last week's reports that Chmerkovskiy skipped their performance due to issues with Lachey \"errupting.\"\n\nA source told ET that he actually refused to rehearse with Lachey this past week due to the two not getting along.\n\nAccording to the source, both Lachey and Chmerkovskiy are \"stubborn, strong-willed people,\" and it was obvious from the beginning that they were going to \"butt heads.\" The source also claims the pair has been faking their seemingly close relationship.\n\n\"They're both super competitive and know how to 'turn it on' as performers,\" the source adds.\n\nBut the heartfelt posts and words the two have shared in the past 24 hours seem to indicate that things have cooled off in their heated partnership.\n\n\"We know what the week is, and that is what dance is,\u201d Lachey told ET. \u201cIt is literally speaking emotion through movement, and I was worried I wasn't going to be able to do it. But I know I got this guy literally standing there, and he\u2019s got my back\u2026 I just looked over and grabbed on and was like, \u2018We got this.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor more on their performance, watch the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2F1280_maks_vanessa_100417.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fet_vanessamaks_100317.png%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/maksim_chmerkovskiy_vanessa_lachey2_gettyimages_859586302.jpg?h=c3ab3c84", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fmaksim_chmerkovskiy_vanessa_lachey2_gettyimages_859586302.jpg%3Fh%3Dc3ab3c84&w=1024&q=100", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2020-11/mirrorball_trophy_gettyimages-1184740546_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2F1280_maks_instagram_vanessa_lachey_0.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fmaksim_chmerkovskiy_vanessa_lachey_gettyimages_859586302.jpg%3Fh%3D2d0e7abc&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/maksim_chmerkovskiy_vanessa_lachey2_gettyimages_859586302.jpg?h=c3ab3c84", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/maksim-chmerkovskiy-praises-dwts-partner-vanessa-lachey-they-can-say-what-they-want-88951", "title": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy Praises 'DWTS' Partner Vanessa Lachey: 'They Can Say What They Want'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/maksim_chmerkovskiy_vanessa_lachey2_gettyimages_859586302.jpg?h=c3ab3c84", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The pro dancer complimented his partner after an emotional dance and rumors of a feud between the two.", "title": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy Praises 'DWTS' Partner Vanessa Lachey: 'They Can Say What They Want'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/maksim-chmerkovskiy-praises-dwts-partner-vanessa-lachey-they-can-say-what-they-want-88951", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The pro dancer complimented his partner after an emotional dance and rumors of a feud between the two.", "twitter": {"description": "The pro dancer complimented his partner after an emotional dance and rumors of a feud between the two.", "title": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy Praises 'DWTS' Partner Vanessa Lachey: 'They Can Say What They Want'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/maksim-chmerkovskiy-praises-dwts-partner-vanessa-lachey-they-can-say-what-they-want-88951", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/maksim_chmerkovskiy_vanessa_lachey2_gettyimages_859586302.jpg?h=c3ab3c84", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy Praises 'DWTS' Partner Vanessa Lachey: 'They Can Say What They Want' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Vanessa Lachey", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 45, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
