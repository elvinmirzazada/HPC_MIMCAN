And, as this is a Taylor Swift music video, there was no shortage of easter eggs and hidden messages, some about Swift's boyfriend Joe Alwyn, others not. Swift was pretty active on Tumblr last night, confirming fan theories. Here, every one she has endorsed:\n\nOn the Video's Meaning\n\nSwift found happiness at the end of the video\u2014it's visible on her face:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only person who sees the real Swift is the guy she met at the end, presumably Joe Alwyn:\n\nSwift's awkward dancing symbolizes her/your inability to act normal in front of a crush:\n\nSwift's public image taking a hit was actually liberating:\n\nOn the Video's Easter Eggs\n\n\"Track 5\" is sprayed on a column in the subway station. \"Delicate\" is the fifth track on Reputation.\n\nThere's a meaning behind Swift's blue dress. Swift endorsed the idea it's a nod to the \"Dancing With Our Hands Tied\" lyric, \"Deep blue, but you painted me golden,\" symbolizing the effect love has on her.\n\nSwift gave the sexiest lyric of the song very interesting choreography:\n\nSwift dancing in the rain in her blue dress is a literal call back to the lyric \"I don't know why but with you I'd dance / In a storm in my best dress\" from \"Fearless\":\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Taylor-Approved Notes\n\nThat the split Swift does on the car actually has history behind it. Swift originally couldn't do a split and explained in a 2016 interview that she worked on the skill every day for a year. \u201cI got it in my head that I couldn\u2019t do a split, and I was really upset about it,\" she said. \"And so I stretched every single day for a year until I could do a split. Somehow I feel better knowing that I can.\u201d On Tumblr, Swift liked several posts applauding her split.\n\nYouTube\n\nJoe's Deli appears to be a little easter egg nod to Swift's boyfriend Joe Alwyn. The sign comes up right before she enters the bar where she meets the guy who's presumably him.\n\nSwift is wearing her snake ring (a nod to the snake emoji that became synonymous with her in the aftermath of the Kim Kardashian's Snapchat takedown). Right when she notices it, she becomes invisible, though you could arguably blame that on the magic note she was holding.\n\nYouTube\n\nYouTube\n\nYouTube\n\nWhile the dancing routine isn't identical to Gene Kelly's in Singing in the Rain, the sentiment is pretty similar, along with some of the frames:\n\nYouTube\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graffiti on the walls behind her say \"Echoes of your footsteps\" (a \"Delicate\" lyric, where the full line is \"Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs\") and \"#5 Delicate.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nYouTube\n\nThe Golden Gopher, the bar Swift walks into, is a real bar in downtown Los Angeles. It could be one of the first places she and Alwyn hung out, or just where she shot that part of the video.\n\nYouTube", "images":
