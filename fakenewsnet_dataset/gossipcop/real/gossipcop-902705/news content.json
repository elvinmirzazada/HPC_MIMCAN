I intend to turn this unfortunate incident into a positive life changing event. Once again, I sincerely apologize for my actions. I have the greatest respect for police officers and the job they do. My actions alleged in the police report do not reflect my core values and my law abiding character.\n\nI am so grateful for the love and support that I am receiving from my family, friends and loyal supporters.\u201d\n\nDe Lesseps was arrested Saturday and charged the following day with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer/firefighter/EMT, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nShe had been discovered trespassing in a hotel room with an unidentified man, according to a police report. The pair had entered the wrong room at the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach and refused to leave.\n\nAccording to the report, de Lesseps \u201cshoved\u201d a police officer who responded to the scene and \u201cslammed\u201d the bathroom door on his forehead.\n\nSplash\n\nDe Lesseps later also told the officer \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you all,\u201d according to the police report.\n\nAfter her arrest, de Lesseps \u2014 who had gotten married to ex-husband Tom D\u2019Agostino in Palm Beach on last New Year\u2019s Eve before their divorce seven months later \u2014 released a statement saying, \u201cThis was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding, and being here brought up long-buried emotions. I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I might have offended with my behavior. I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Early Warning Signs That May Have Led to Luann De Lesseps\u2019 Divorce From Tom D\u2019Agostino\n\nA source told PEOPLE that \u201cLuann was out with a girlfriend at the Colony Hotel where she had her wedding brunch just a year ago \u2014 it was the first time she had been back to Palm Beach since the wedding.\u201d\n\n\u201cMemories from that day came flooding back, she was emotional and her behavior was out of character,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe mother of two was released on her own recognizance Sunday, according to the Palm Beach Post, and Judge Ted Booras said she would be allowed to return to her home state of New York. However, he warned her not to ignore the charges against her. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be that hard to find you,\u201d he said.\n\nShe is due back in court Jan. 25, 2018.", "images":
