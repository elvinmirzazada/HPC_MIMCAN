The two wed in 1997 and are now parents of Jaden Smith as well as Willow Smith, so they have indeed come a long way.\n\n\u201cTwo decades. When you\u2019re married with somebody that long and we were talking about it, we was like, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s 20 years, what are we gonna do?\u2019 She was like, \u2018We\u2019re gonna high-five and keep it moving,'\u201d Smith said of his long-term relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s really interesting, it\u2019s like, when you see couples that have been together long and you have that look between them and you just now, if you haven\u2019t been with somebody that long, you just can\u2019t really say the thing where you get to that place where you find the magic in the mundane, where you\u2019re not seeking the high stimulus and all of that ravaging, craving \u2013 it\u2019s just really simple and really easy, you know,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not what I pictured in my mind\u2026 what it\u2019s supposed to be. It\u2019s like, unconditional love is a whole lot harder and different than it looks in the movies.\u201d\n\nPerhaps we should learn from the both of them who still try to keep things exciting by giving gifts spontaneously instead of waiting for special occasions, \u201cWhat we did probably about eight years ago is we stopped giving gifts on holidays because people expect them.\u201d \u201cSo we surprise each other in the middle of the year. We\u2019ll just say, it\u2019s October 11 and she\u2019ll just come home and I\u2019ll say, \u2018Hey baby, it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day.\u2019 And then the surprise of it is what gives the energy back, whereas if you\u2019re waiting for a gift on Christmas to top what you did last year, you really can\u2019t do it.\u201d Aww!\n\n[Source]", "images": ["https://lipstiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MOBILE.png", "https://lipstiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/vimooz-750x625.jpg.webp", "https://lipstiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/vimooz.jpg", "https://www.lipstiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/youth-health.jpg", "https://www.lipstiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/getty-will.jpg", "https://lipstiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/STICKY-MENU.png", "https://lipstiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HEADER.png"], "top_img": "https://lipstiq.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/vimooz.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://lipstiq.com/160956/will-smith-talks-20-year-marriage-jada-pinkett-smith-absolutely-gold/", "title": "Will Smith Talks His 20-Year Marriage To Jada Pinkett Smith & It\u2019s Absolutely Gold", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "facebook-domain-verification": "ijbkh6bdvfidko6gmz99j3cy76vb0d", "og": {"url": "https://lipstiq.com/160956/will-smith-talks-20-year-marriage-jada-pinkett-smith-absolutely-gold/", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Lipstiq.com", "title": "Will Smith Talks His 20-Year Marriage To Jada Pinkett Smith & It's Absolutely Gold \u2013 Lipstiq.com", "type": "article", "description": "Some people can\u2019t even keep their own shit together, but power couple Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith will be celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary this month, setting a prime example of how a successful legal union should be.
