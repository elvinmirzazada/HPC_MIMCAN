Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\nShawniece and Jephte Make Up, Again\n\nJephte was so upset at the prospect of having to surrender his phone to Shawniece that he walked out. She refused to chase him. After getting some (good) advice from his friend, he left her a few roses as an apology. Later, they discussed their five-year plan and surprisingly, seemed to be on the same page when it came to career, travel and kids.\n\nMolly and Jonathan Still Haven\u2019t had Sex\n\nMolly was committed to showing Jonathan more physical affection.

Pastor Cal reasoned that she might just want some extended vacations, but Ryan argued that she wanted to move abroad. Instead of going home to Jaclyn (who was sick), Ryan opted to leave the boys\u2019 night to hang with a friend.
