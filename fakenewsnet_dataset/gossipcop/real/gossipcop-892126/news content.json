That means that I hate, or does that mean that I actually love you and I do things out of spite?\" Scott asks.\n\n\"That's not a way to show your love!\" Kourtney insists. \"When someone's trying to f**k with me, I'm not into having them at my sister's party.\"\n\nA few back and forths later, Khloe finally jumps in.\n\n\"I am on the longest Ferris wheel of all time. Like, we gotta get off the ride at some point and get on a new one,\" Khloe says. But her words of wisdom don't seem to do much to help the situation, as Scott attempts to make up with Kourtney by asking if she wants \"to make out.\"\n\n\"You guys are so f**king dysfunctional. I don't know if this is something you guys do as foreplay, but this is f**king nuts,\" she yells. \"You two are so f**king nuts, seriously. And the fact that you waste my time when you guys are now just gonna go get mani pedis.\"\n\n\"We don't hook up,\" Kourtney laughs.\n\n\"You guys are f**king sick!\" Khloe responds.\n\nKourtney may not be hooking up with Scott -- but he's hooking up with Sofia Richie. See more on their romance in the video below.\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on E!", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/khloe_kardashian_626531608.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2Fkourtney_scott.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2Fkourtney_kardashian_kuwtk.jpg%3Fh%3D68341a7f&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fscott_disick_kuwtk.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fkhloe_kardashian_626531608.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/khloe_kardashian_626531608.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-calls-kourtney-and-scott-disick-fking-sick-after-trying-hash-out-their-drama-90781", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Calls Kourtney and Scott Disick 'F**king Sick' After Trying to Hash Out Their Drama", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/khloe_kardashian_626531608.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "According to Khloe, Kourtney and Scott's relationship couldn't be more 'dysfunctional.'", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Calls Kourtney and Scott Disick 'F**king Sick' After Trying to Hash Out Their Drama", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-calls-kourtney-and-scott-disick-fking-sick-after-trying-hash-out-their-drama-90781", "type": "Article"}, "description": "According to Khloe, Kourtney and Scott's relationship couldn't be more 'dysfunctional.'", "twitter": {"description": "According to Khloe, Kourtney and Scott's relationship couldn't be more 'dysfunctional.'", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Calls Kourtney and Scott Disick 'F**king Sick' After Trying to Hash Out Their Drama", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-calls-kourtney-and-scott-disick-fking-sick-after-trying-hash-out-their-drama-90781", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/khloe_kardashian_626531608.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Khloe Kardashian Calls Kourtney and Scott Disick 'F**king Sick' After Trying to Hash Out Their Drama | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Scott Disick, Keeping Up With The Kardashians", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
