Perez was arrested Thursday at around 9:35 p.m. after Hadid told police he had left \u201cnumerous unwanted threatening messages\u201d to her through social media, the spokesperson said.\n\nPerez was charged with aggravated harassment and stalking. The investigation is ongoing, and it is unclear if he is still in custody, the spokesperson tells PEOPLE.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kendall Jenner \u2014 Traumatized by Stalkers and Robbers \u2014 Visit a Gun Range\n\nThe model did not let the incident stop her from enjoying her night, as she later headed to friend Samuel Krost\u2019s birthday dinner, which Bella shared video of on her Instagram stories.\n\nThere she was joined by sister Gigi, who had just closed Jeremy Scott\u2019s New York Fashion Week show.\n\nHadid recently landed her first dual cover alongside Gigi for the March issue of British Vogue.\n\nSteven Meisel\n\nThe duos mother, Yolanda Hadid, was spotted by paparazzi in Beverly Hills and asked how she felt about the covers, to which she told a TMZ photographer, \u201cI love it. Love the skin you\u2019re in, baby!\u201d\n\nWhile Hadid has grown comfortable in her own skin, earlier in January she revealed that she used to get so nervous before interviews that she would \u201cstart crying and shaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sister [Gigi Hadid] is very bubbly and very out there, and I was always very reserved. I would literally start crying and shaking if I had to do interviews at red carpet events. It was really nerve-racking and it\u2019s scary, and it\u2019s not only you,\u201d she said during an episode of her mother\u2019s Lifetime series Making a Model with Yolanda Hadid.\n\n\u201cIt gets a lot better once you have to talk to people every day,\u201d she added while giving advice to an aspiring model who struggled with nerves. \u201cThen you\u2019re like, \u2018Okay, I guess it\u2019s my job, I have to do it!'\u201d", "images":
