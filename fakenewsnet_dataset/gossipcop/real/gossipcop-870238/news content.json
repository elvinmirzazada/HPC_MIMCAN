In the Instagram clip, Spears and Asghari start off walking hand in hand down a hallway. As they walk, you can hear Asghari complimenting Spears on her outfit. But then she interrupts him and asks where they\u2019ll be eating. When he says \u201csteakhouse,\u201d she gets a goofy expression on her face and runs off, to which Asghari replies, \u201cI think she\u2019s really hungry.\u201d\n\nSpears confirmed that in the caption of her video.\n\n\u201cI was freaking hungry.\u201d she wrote.\n\nBritney Spears and Sam Asghari have often given fans behind the scenes peeks into their relationship via posts on Instagram. They\u2019ve become known for their couples workout videos which show off their physical fitness and affection for each other. Britney also regularly shares heartwarming photos of them looking very much in love.\n\nIn the past, Asghari has said that he believes that they were brought together by fate. He was cast in her \u201cSlumber Party\u201d video in 2016 and he told Men\u2019s Health that his inclusion in the taping was a last minute decision as they had already hired most of the other people who were in it.\n\n\u201cI got a call at midnight,\u201d Asghari told Men\u2019s Health in July.\n\n\u201cIt went through so much to get to me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s some sort of a blessing or just meant to be.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian-born model added that he tried to be funny with her after she introduced herself by pretending that he didn\u2019t hear her name. It looks like the joke worked though because shortly after the video was released, the two were photographed together by paparazzi. Based on what Asghari said to Men\u2019s Health, it looks like they started dating very soon after they met because, at one point, he reveals they never had any intention of being friends.\n\nDuring the interview, Asghari raved about his popstar girlfriend, praising her for her humble nature and expressing gratitude for her presence in his life.\n\n\u201cShe motivates me more than anyone,\u201d Asghari continued.", "images": ["https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/inquisitr_cross.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v3/assets/search-icon.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patricia Grannum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5206930/britney-spears-and-boyfriend-sam-asghari-post-hilarious-new-video-on-instagram", "title": "Britney Spears And Boyfriend Sam Asghari Post Hilarious New Video On Instagram", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Britney Spears and her boyfriend Sam Asghari posted a video on Wednesday night which gave fans a hilarious glimpse at what the singer is really like when she&#8217;s hungry.
