The Team USA athlete adopted Beemo from a dog farm during the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, earlier this year.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Pets That Have Their Own Social Media Accounts These celebrity pets have their own social media accounts with huge followings \u2014 and you need to follow them now!\n\n\u201cTwo days ago my beautiful baby Beemo passed away,\u201d Kenworthy captioned an Instagram photo showing the pup licking his ear. \u201cIt was completely unexpected and Matt [Wilkas] and I are beside ourselves trying to cope with her loss. For a week or so we\u2019d been worrying because she was showing less and less interest in her food. There were several trips to the vet and on our final visit this past Thursday I asked them do a full body scan in case there was an underlying issue they had missed. Beemo went into a panic attack during the x-rays and her breathing became rapid and shallow. The scan revealed that her lungs were deteriorated and that her heart was too big for her body \u2013 a birth defect we had no way of knowing about.\u201d\n\nKenworthy rushed her from that vet, who was unable to treat her, to an emergency vet where she was placed on a respirator in the hope \u201cthey could get her vitals back to a normal level so she could be treated but they were never able to do so.\u201d\n\nThe athlete wrote that the days since losing Beemo have been \u201ca blur.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt all happened so fast that it\u2019s still hard to believe it,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe ER doc told us that even if we\u2019d somehow spotted the issue earlier it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference in the end. He said that she\u2019d been living on \u2018borrowed time\u2019 from the get go. Beemo was truly the best thing that ever happened to me and I feel so fortunate for our borrowed time together. I\u2019ve never loved anything or anyone in the way that I loved that dog and she is and will always be deeply missed.\n\n\u201cShe was so smart and playful. She brought so much happiness to so many people every single day. I\u2019ll always remember being out on a walk with her and every other second she would get stopped by someone wanting to pet her, kneel down and kiss her, hold her in their arms or take a photo and on many occasions a crowd of people would have formed around her. That was her power: she made people smile,\u201d Kenworthy concluded. \u201cShe was the kindest, most gentle soul I\u2019ve ever known. She loved people. She loved birds and the snow. She loved me and Matt. But most of all she loved meeting other dogs. If any of you have pets up in doggy heaven please tell them to go find Bee because she could really use a good play date right now. RIP sweet creature \u2013 your daddy loves you more than you could ever even know!\u201d\n\nKenworthy and his boyfriend, Matthew Wilkas, announced in February that they had fallen for the puppy at first sight and planned to take her home after the games.\n\nRelated: Meet Team USA They\u2019re at the top of their games \u2014 and hope to top Olympic podiums this month in PyeongChang.

Across the country there are 2.5 million dogs being raised for food in some of the most disturbing conditions imaginable,\u201d the freestyle skier wrote on Instagram at the time. \u201cYes, there is an argument to be made that eating dogs is a part of Korean culture. And, while don\u2019t personally agree with it, I do agree that it\u2019s not my place to impose western ideals on the people here. The way these animals are being treated, however, is completely inhumane and culture should never be a scapegoat for cruelty.\u201d\n\nA month later, the couple revealed Beemo was finally home with them in the states after she was quarantined. Kenworthy gushed to Us in March about the pup.\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.

When we were coming up with a name from Beemo, we were going over pop queens and divas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then I kind of just wanted to keep it in the family with her older brother who lives with my ex, so we went with another character which is Beemo.\u201d\n\nRelated: Match These Adorable Celebrity Pets to Their Famous Owners How well do you know your celebrity pets?
