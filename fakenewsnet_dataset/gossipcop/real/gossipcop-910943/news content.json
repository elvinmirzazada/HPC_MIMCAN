Shortly after the show ended, Salling was arrested for felony possession of child pornography. He pled guilty just one month before his death and was set to appear in court on March 7.\n\n\u201cI know life was very, very hard for Mark. I think we all do the best we can at the end of the day. I know Mark that did the best he could,\u201d Lynch continued. The Emmy Award winner admitted she didn\u2019t know Salling\u2019s family and really didn\u2019t know him, regardless of working together for six years.\n\n\u201cHe was a hard guy to get to know,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: Most Shocking Celebrity Deaths of All Time Us Weekly looks back at the stars who died before their time, including Amy Winehouse, Prince and Whitney Houston \u2014 see the most shocking celeb deaths\n\nHowever, she does have a personal memory with Salling she holds close to her heart.\n\n\u201cHe took videos of the stages and everything. He was so happy to be coming to work, to be on the show. He wrote a song and videotaped his day being on Glee,\u201d Lynch explained. \u201cDriving into the Paramount lot \u2026 at that time he was living on a cot in a little room. It was a big jump for him in his career, and also, he had a job and was in with this group of really great kids. I think he knew that he was breathing rarefied air. There was so much joy and happiness in his musical video that he shot for himself. Fox made him take it down. But it was a sweet, beautiful expression of his joy and being in Glee.\u201d\n\nRelated: Glee Stars\u2019 Real Yearbook Pics See what Lea, Cory -- and more! -- looked like in high school\n\nAs Us previously reported, Salling\u2019s estate may not have to pay his victims $50,000 each following the death. \u201cRestitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge \u2026 He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,\u201d a source explained.\n\nSalling, who was 35 at his time of death, \u201cknew he would have nothing to come back to after he went to prison,\u201d an insider close to the actor told Us.\n\nThank You!
