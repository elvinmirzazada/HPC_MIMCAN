She told the LA Times she was flattered and that she was a good singer. But she failed to take Johnny Carson\u2019s advice and started too high. The boos come loud and fast, but like any comic who\u2019s bombed before, she barrel rolled through her ear-piercing, crotch-grabbing rendition in a little over a minute, then spat on the mound.\n\nThis performance by Carl Lewis before a Chicago Bulls game seems almost inexplicable, because he\u2019s not a singer but an Olympic track and field star. He murdered Francis Scott Off-Key\u2019s song, as these ESPN broadcasters put it, in failing to hit the high notes and apologizing midway through with an intent to make it up to the crowd (he never could). He later told Oprah he was \u201cglad\u201d he botched it.\n\nFresh off their 2001 album \u201cJust Push Play,\u201d people were \u201cJaded\u201d after seeing Aerosmith\u2019s Steven Tyler try and spruce up the National Anthem, first by riffing on harmonica, then essentially shouting through the performance. He doesn\u2019t even sing \u201cbrave\u201d at the end of the song, opting to call out to the Indy 500 crowd as fireworks went off. In 2012, he also earned some groans when he belted out his throaty \u201cyeaaahhh\u201d during the song.\n\nLead singer of alt-rock band Staind Aaron Lewis delivered a relatively strong, growling rendition of \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner,\u201d but early on he missed the line \u201cat the twilight\u2019s last gleaming.\u201d He said in a statement he felt devastated, asking for \u201cthe Nation\u2019s forgiveness\u201d by saying \u201cnerves got the best of me.\u201d\n\nChristina Aguilera likewise nailed her pitch but found herself doubling back to \u201cthe twilight\u2019s last gleaming\u201d rather than moving on to \u201cgallantly streaming.\u201d Maybe she doesn\u2019t nail the last note, but she still performed like a pro.\n\nThe incredible echo you can hear in this video would\u2019ve been enough to doom Michael Bolton\u2019s crooning of the Anthem at this 2003 Red Sox vs. Yankees game, but Bolton had to stop and peek at lyrics scrawled in his palm in order to remember \u201ctwilight\u2019s last gleaming,\u201d and the Boston fans let him have it.\n\nClearly the 20-year-old Dominican pop star Kat DeLuna put a lot of bluster and verve into her performance of \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner.\u201d The eye test would make you think she\u2019s killing it. But a pitchy last note and a chorus of boos from this Dallas Cowboys crowd would disagree.\n\nMaybe this one isn\u2019t bad so much as perplexing. Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea performed a solo, phased out performance of \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner\u201d at Staples Center this past April for Kobe Bryant\u2019s farewell game that drew mixed reaction. Compare that to when he formed a bizarre duet with Josh Groban singing the Anthem back in 2010.\n\nMaybe she would\u2019ve been better of singing \u201cO Canada\u201d? Canadian jazz singer Alexis Normand\u2019s mind went completely blank as she fumbled words left and right to the Anthem that she ended up humming the remainder of the song. Thankfully the crowd was polite enough to bail her out.\n\nCountry star Dierks Bentley received no mercy online after performing the anthem ahead of Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals in June 2017: \u201cSounded like the drunk guy at the bar trying to be in tune,\u201d wrote one commenter.\n\nRachel Platten, best known for \u201cFight Song,\u201d messed up the national anthem not once, but twice, while performing before the NWSL soccer game between the Utah Royals and the Chicago Red Stars in April. She forgot the words and had to start over, asking the crowd for help.\n\nFergie got ripped for her rendition before the NBA All-Star Game in February 2018: \u201cFergie sang that Anthem so bad, Kaepernick stood up and told her not to disrespect the Anthem like that.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Untitled-1-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-4.10.53-PM.png?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-2023-06-05T113544.630.jpg?fit=300%2C169&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Tucker-Carlson-election-night-2020.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Untitled-design-2023-06-05T113544.630.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/lebowski.png?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Brian-Welk.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Brian-Welk.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Untitled-1-1.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Untitled-1-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Welk", "Raquel 'Rocky' Harris", "Meriah Doty", "J.
