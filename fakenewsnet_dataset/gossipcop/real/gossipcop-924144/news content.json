Grey\u2019s Anatomy showrunner Krista Vernoff reveals to TVLine that the ABC drama\u2019s titular MD \u201cwill very much be part of our \u2018Season of Love.'\u201d\n\nTV\u2019s Big Cast Changes (2018-2019) View Gallery 162 Images\n\nClarifying remarks made Tuesday by ABC\u2019s spoiler-avoidant president Channing Dungey, who downplayed buzz that that Season 15 would find Meredith re-entering the dating scene for the first time since the death of her beloved McDreamy nearly four years ago, Vernoff shares, \u201cChanning was keeping it mellow and trying to avoid spoilers because Shondaland is secrecy land. But as the showrunner, I can confirm for you that Meredith Grey is very much a part of our Season of Love.\u201d\n\nAs Vernoff explains, \u201cYes, [Mer]\u2019s a single mom, and that complicates a dating life. And yes, she\u2019s a surgical marvel with new, game changing medical ideas she\u2019ll be pursuing. But she also hasn\u2019t dated at all since [Martin Henderson\u2019s] Nathan Riggs left [in Season 13]. And the one-two punch of meeting [Scott Speedman\u2019s] Nick Marsh awoke a desire in her that she can\u2019t put back to sleep.\n\n\u201cThe question this season,\u201d Vernoff adds, \u201cis not \u2018Will Meredith Grey find love again,\u2019 but \u2018With whom will she find love?'\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Speedman\u2019s fan-favorite character, Vernoff divulges the real reason the show didn\u2019t pursue a romance between Nick and a clearly smitten Meredith. \u201cWe all loved him, but Nick was designed as a one episode guest star,\u201d the EP notes, \u201cwhich is the whole reason Scott agreed to come play him!\u201d", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c213e92eefd3e4067f90b2d4835712ad?s=32&d=blank&r=pg",
