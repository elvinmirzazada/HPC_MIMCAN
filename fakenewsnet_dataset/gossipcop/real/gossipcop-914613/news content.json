Like some real Love and Basketball?\"\n\nThat's when Foxx's face turned stone cold. He took off his headphones and mic, and promptly walked off the interview.\n\n\"He ready to go. He ready to hoop,\" Smith said before transitioning to the show's next segment.\n\nWhile Foxx wouldn't confirm it, he and Holmes did spend Valentine's Day together playing basketball. The two were all smiles in photos obtained by ET, heading to the courts in casual workout gear. The pair's Wednesday outing is one of just a handful of appearances they've made in public together since September, but are rumored to have been dating since 2013.\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2F1280_watermarkedbgus_1143504_032.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2Fjustin_bieber_gettyimages-919131708.jpg%3Fh%3D81d87e46&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2Fjamie_foxx_GettyImages-919122762.jpg%3Fh%3D2d59b125&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/FOXX.jpg?h=07103132"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/FOXX.jpg?h=07103132", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jamie-foxx-walks-off-live-espn-broadcast-after-being-asked-about-katie-holmes-watch-96611", "title": "Jamie Foxx Walks Off Live ESPN Broadcast After Being Asked About Katie Holmes -- Watch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/FOXX.jpg?h=07103132", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 50-year-old actor is not ready to talk about his relationship.", "title": "Jamie Foxx Walks Off Live ESPN Broadcast After Being Asked About Katie Holmes -- Watch", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jamie-foxx-walks-off-live-espn-broadcast-after-being-asked-about-katie-holmes-watch-96611", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 50-year-old actor is not ready to talk about his relationship.", "twitter": {"description": "The 50-year-old actor is not ready to talk about his relationship.", "title": "Jamie Foxx Walks Off Live ESPN Broadcast After Being Asked About Katie Holmes -- Watch", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jamie-foxx-walks-off-live-espn-broadcast-after-being-asked-about-katie-holmes-watch-96611", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/FOXX.jpg?h=07103132", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Jamie Foxx Walks Off Live ESPN Broadcast After Being Asked About Katie Holmes -- Watch | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
