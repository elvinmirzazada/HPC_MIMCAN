Do what makes YOU happy! Love the skin you\u2019re in!\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BfBcX5Jhnea/?taken-by=kimzolciakbiermann\n\n\n\nAccording to the mom of six, her husband Kroy Biermann, praises her regardless if she\u2019s natural or all dolled up.\n\n\u201cMy husband makes me feel beautiful at all times!\u201d she gushed.\n\nDespite her proud admission to Botox injections, fillers, breast enhancement and tummy tuck procedures, and even cellulite injections, she continues to vehemently deny rumors of facial plastic surgery. And seemingly credits her appearance to her skincare routine.\n\n\u201cI have ALWAYS been into skincare and my skin. I have gone to bed maybe twice in my entire life with makeup on (yes even if I\u2019m swaying at the sink hunni, I still scrub that face).\u201d Adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s REALLY important to do YOU! Do what makes YOU happy! Love the skin you\u2019re in!\u201d\n\nDo you believe this is Kim Zolciak\u2019s bare face or Photoshop sorcery?
