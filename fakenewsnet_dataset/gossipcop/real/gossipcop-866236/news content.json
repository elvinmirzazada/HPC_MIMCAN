Simpson was always the bronze medal to Christina Aguilera\u2019s silver and Britney Spears\u2019s gold. Likewise, Lachey and his boy band, 98 Degrees, were consistently afterthoughts to the insanely popular Backstreet Boys and NSYNC. But thanks to a little show called Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica in 2003, MTV catapulted these two into household names. Simpson\u2019s dumb blonde act (at least, we\u2019re pretty sure it was an act) gave us so many gems that the couple forever secured their place in pop culture, even though they split only 3 years later in 2005. To get an idea of what went on behind the scenes, we spoke to Sue Kolinsky, who served as producer on the show for all three seasons of Newlyweds. Kolinsky, who lives in Los Angeles and still works in the television industry, is a three-time Emmy nominated producer. She has popular reality shows such Top Chef, Last Comic Standing and The Osbournes on her resume. Kolinsky spilled on the show's surprising success, Jessica's dumb blonde \"act\" and the tension between the couple in the last season.\n\nWere you fans of Nick and/or Jessica before production started?\n\nI had no idea who Jessica was.\n\nSo how did you end up working on the show?\n\nA group of us had worked with MTV on The Osbournes, and then two shows came up, and we had a choice between Rich Girls with Tommy Hilfiger's daughter or Newlyweds. I just chose Newlyweds because it sounded fun to be inside the world of somebody's brand new marriage. As soon as we started looking at the footage and I saw the \"Is this chicken or fish?\" [scene], I knew it was going to be a really fun ride.", "images": ["https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/23/campaign_images/9346e0158869/al-pacinos-girlfriend-noor-alfallah-says-couple-w-3-2034-1701213443-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/15/campaign_images/9346e0158869/teyana-taylor-reportedly-blaming-iman-shumpert-fo-3-532-1701186082-1_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/images/public/defaults/user_large.jpg", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/29/4/campaign_images/d7dbf2ea1624/the-boys-mexico-spinoff-now-in-the-works-with-blu-3-917-1701233287-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/complex/images/ibp5hzfsy21vi9z1esln/jessica-simpson-nick-lachey.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/22/campaign_images/874ca2637b5e/people-are-using-ai-to-generate-bizarre-images-of-3-1397-1701209335-6_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/29/5/campaign_images/9346e0158869/first-track-from-jay-z-co-produced-the-book-of-cl-3-3226-1701236027-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/complex/images/ibp5hzfsy21vi9z1esln/jessica-simpson-nick-lachey.jpg?output-format=jpg&output-quality=auto", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/22/campaign_images/01ac8f36ed7a/bradley-cooper-proves-eagles-superfandom-when-fac-3-1932-1701211637-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/23/campaign_images/b1ce44a7ffd9/jada-pinkett-smith-reveals-she-and-will-smith-pla-3-2049-1701215394-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/21/campaign_images/9dbf20f7ce1f/mike-the-situation-sorrentino-spent-500000-on-coc-3-1266-1701206248-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/3/campaign_images/0cfb7715616d/bradley-cooper-would-do-the-hangover-4-in-an-inst-3-1538-1701142872-12_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2022-12/8/10/tmp/b3fecd0e5aaa/tmp-name-3-1518-1670493705-5_dblbig.jpg", "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2023-11/28/17/campaign_images/bc3737558ab8/dl-hughley-says-king-harris-behavior-is-insulting-3-755-1701191326-0_16x9.jpg?output-quality=auto&fill=3840:2160;center,top"], "top_img": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2022-12/8/10/tmp/b3fecd0e5aaa/tmp-name-3-1518-1670493705-5_dblbig.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Zupkus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/lauren-zupkus/newlyweds-jessica-simpson-nick-lachey", "title": "'Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica' Was Less Scripted Than You Thought It Was", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "copyright_buzzfeed_inc", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Complex", "title": "'Newlyweds: Nick &amp;
