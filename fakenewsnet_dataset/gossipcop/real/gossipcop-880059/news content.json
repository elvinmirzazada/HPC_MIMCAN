Kendall runs off backstage just before she was set to strut the catwalk. Kylie is pulled over and given a ticket before speeding off with her lavish orange Lamborghini.\n\nKirby Jenner, Kendall\u2019s faux fraternal twin brother, is also featured on the video during the Jenner sister\u2019s part. Kirby became famous on Instagram for flawlessly Photoshopping himself onto Kendall\u2019s photos.\n\nThe last part of the video shows the KarJenners being brought together on the set. This is where the nostalgic part comes in as they reenact the original opening credits of their hit reality TV show. Kim is noticeably not present yet.\n\nMomager Kris asks where Kim is as they try to find the perfect group pose. Khloe replies with \u201cMom, she\u2019s always late.\u201d Kim suddenly arrives at the set and says \u201cNo, I\u2019m here\u201d as she gets in the middle of the shot. Her sisters pushed her to side the same way they did before.\n\nIn the recreation of the original opening credits, Bruce Jenner and Rob Kardashian are noticeably missing. The issues they have with the KarJenner family are probably one of the reasons they are out.\n\nScott Disick, Kourtney\u2019s ex-boyfriend, is reported to be fired after the season 14 of the E! show. Disick reportedly already knew that the day would come that he would be removed from the show\u2019s payroll as things are starting to get serious between Kourtney and her new boyfriend, Younes Bendjima.\n\nWatch the clip below of the all-new Keeping Up With The Kardashians Season 14 teaser.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtZo62mPEKM&feature=youtu.be\n\nKeeping Up With The Kardashians Season 14 airs on E! on Sunday, October 1, at 9 p.m. ET.\n\n[Featured image by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Yeezy Season 3]", "images": ["https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/inquisitr_cross.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/WhatsApp.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v3/assets/search-icon.svg", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/mail.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Twitter.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Copy+Link.png", "https://d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/share/Facebook.png", "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://d15pn4sjte4r7g.cloudfront.net/inquisitr/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Van Buren"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4509858/kardashian-jenners-recreate-the-original-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-intro-10-years-later-and-its-epic", "title": "Kardashian-Jenners Recreate The Original \u2018Keeping Up With The Kardashians\u2019 Intro 10 Years Later And It\u2019s Epic", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "As the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians is set to air it&#8217;s 10th anniversary season, the fans are going crazy as the Kardashian-Jenners released a very fresh, fierce and nostalgic teaser.
