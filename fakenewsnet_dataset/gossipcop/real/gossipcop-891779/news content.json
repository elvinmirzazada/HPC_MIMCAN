His estranged wife Khloe Kardashian \u2014 with whom he starred in a reality TV series \u2014 was by his side for a good portion of his recovery.\n\nIn an interview with Us Weekly earlier this year, Odom said he was clean now.\n\n\u201cLiving sober, meaning no drugs, is a great feeling,\u201d said Odom, who played 14 seasons in the NBA and won two championships for the L.A. Lakers. \u201cBeing in the moment is important \u2014 how you react, respond, create.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KC-Chiefs-Travis-Kelce.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/robbie-rogers-fellow-travelers.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Lamar-Odom1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fallon-kelce.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jeff-Shell.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Lamar-Odom1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Lamar-Odom1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Raquel 'Rocky' Harris", "Sharon Knolle", "Dessi Gomez", "Stephanie Kaloi", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/lamar-odom-doing-well-after-collapsing-at-hollywood-nightclub/", "title": "Lamar Odom Is \u2018Doing Well\u2019 After Collapsing at Hollywood Nightclub", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lamar Odom Is 'Doing Well' After Collapsing at Hollywood Nightclub - TheWrap", "description": "Spokesperson says ex-NBA star was dehydrated and had intensely worked out earlier in the day", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/lamar-odom-doing-well-after-collapsing-at-hollywood-nightclub/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Lamar-Odom1.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-11-06T16:08:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-06T16:18:57+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Lamar Odom Is \u2018Doing Well\u2019 After Collapsing at Hollywood Nightclub", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/lamar-odom-doing-well-after-collapsing-at-hollywood-nightclub/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-11-06T08:08:00-08:00", "parsely-section": "culture", "parsely-author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "parsely-tags": "lamar_odom", "article-tags": "lamar_odom}", "article-section": "culture", "article-categories": "culture, sports-category-column", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509984480.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
