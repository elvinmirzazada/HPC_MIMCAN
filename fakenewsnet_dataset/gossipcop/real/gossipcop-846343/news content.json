Beyonce is known for her women-empowerment songs, so I guess it was only right that this anthem was chosen as the premiere single from her new album.\n\nShe took a mini break from the music scene, but she is ready to retake her place on the music industry's throne. And with songs like this, she'll be welcomed back with open arms.\n\nCheck out the full version of the leaked song below.
