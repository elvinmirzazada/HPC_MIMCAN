Millie told the queen she met Grande backstage before the concert.\n\nThe Monday night blast at Manchester Arena killed at least 22 people and left dozens injured. The blast, which occurred in the venue's foyer, came at the conclusion of Grande\u2019s concert, just after pink balloons had fallen from the arena's ceiling.\n\nGrande's audience at Manchester Arena was mostly young people, many of them teens and pre-teens wearing the singer's signature bunny ears. The queen called it \"very wicked\" to \"target that sort of thing.\"\n\nQueen Elizabeth also met with a 14-year-old girl and her parents and a 12-year-old girl and her mom. The queen told one of the families it was \"very interesting how everybody has united\" in the wake of the attack.\n\nShe also met with a mother who was injured while waiting for her 12-year-old daughter at the concert. The woman, identified as Ruth Murrell, told the queen her daughter attended the concert with a friend. The friend\u2019s mother died in the blast.\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II, right, speaks to Ruth Murrell during the Queen's visit to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital in Manchester England, to meet victims, May 25, 2017.\n\nRoyal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital has 371 beds and is the \"largest single-site children's hospital in the U.K.,\" according to its website.\n\nThe queen issued a statement quickly after the attack, saying, \u201cThe whole nation has been shocked.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I speak for everyone in expressing my deepest sympathy to all who have been affected by this dreadful event and especially to the families and friends of those who have died or were injured,\u201d the statement read.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/fbi-carjack-ht-gmh-231129_1701298300800_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/trump-documents-lawsuit-ap-lv-231128_1701220970279_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/henry-kissinger-ap-moe-021-230531_1685552928046_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/wirestory_278e6651e99593b17a00bc71c37bfc85_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/AP-queen-manchester-victims2-ml-170525_4x5_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/images/hulu.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/rockefeller-tree-ap-jef-231128_1701183464711_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/AP-queen-manchester-victims-ml-170525_16x9_992.jpg?w=992"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/AP-queen-manchester-victims-ml-170525_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/queen-elizabeth-ii-visits-victims-manchester-arena-attack/story?id=47634755", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II visits victims of the Manchester Arena attack in hospital", "meta_data": {"description": "The queen also visited with the hospital's doctors and nurses.", "keywords": "queen elizabeth, manchester, hospital, visit, ariana grande, survivors, victims, concert, blast, Article, 47634755", "copyright": "2023 ABC News", "author": "ABC News", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Queen Elizabeth II visits victims of the Manchester Arena attack in hospital", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/queen-elizabeth-ii-visits-victims-manchester-arena-attack/story?id=47634755", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II visits victims of the Manchester Arena attack in hospital", "description": "The queen also visited with the hospital's doctors and nurses.", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/AP-queen-manchester-victims-ml-170525_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2017-05-25T14:47:25Z", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,47634755", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,47634755", "googleplay": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/queen-elizabeth-ii-visits-victims-manchester-arena-attack/story?id=47634755"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "ABC News", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II visits victims of the Manchester Arena attack in hospital", "description": "The queen also visited with the hospital's doctors and nurses.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/queen-elizabeth-ii-visits-victims-manchester-arena-attack/story?id=47634755", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/AP-queen-manchester-victims-ml-170525_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,47634755", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,47634755", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for ipad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/International/queen-elizabeth-ii-visits-victims-manchester-arena-attack/story?id=47634755", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/queen-elizabeth-ii-visits-victims-manchester-arena-attack/story?id=47634755"}}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
