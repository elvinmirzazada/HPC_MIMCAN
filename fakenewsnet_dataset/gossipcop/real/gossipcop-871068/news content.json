She came to public prominence for her participation on the first two seasons of VH1's Flavor of Love (2006\u20132007). Pollard was given the nickname \"New York\" by rapper Flavor Flav. She is also known colloquially by her self-proclaimed nickname \"HBIC\" \u2013 an acronym for \"Head Bitch in Charge\" \u2013 which she exclaimed in the Flavor of Love series to taunt her competitors.[2] Her temperamental and outspoken nature often led to tension with the other women on the show but made her an instant fan favorite.\n\nAfter Flavor of Love, Pollard starred in the show's spin-off I Love New York from 2007 to 2008. In later years, Pollard took part in 17th series of the British edition of Celebrity Big Brother in 2016, where she eventually finished in fourth place. In 2017, Pollard began starring in Brunch with Tiffany, a talk show series featured on VH1's YouTube channel, which was later picked up premiering on the VH1 television network during late 2020. In 2022, Pollard began hosting Hot Haus, a queer sex reality competition on the OutTV television and streaming network.[3] In 2023, Pollard became a main cast member on College Hill: Celebrity Edition alongside Joseline Hernandez, Amber Rose, and Ray J. She has also previously hosted the Fenty Beauty holiday gift guide twice.[4][5]\n\nTelevision appearances [ edit ]\n\nPollard first achieved public prominence for starring on hit shows with among the largest audiences seen on basic television, VH1's Flavor of Love (2006\u20132007) and I Love New York (2007\u20132008).[6] Over 7.5 million people watched Pollard during the Flavor of Love season 2 finale.[6]\n\n2006: Breakout with Flavor of Love [ edit ]\n\nFlavor of Love [ edit ]\n\nPollard (then age 23) clashed with virtually all the other contestants. Although these feuds were, in general, nothing more than screaming matches, an incident in the penultimate episode of season one led to violence. After her elimination, an outraged Brooke \"Pumkin\" Thompson spat on Pollard after the two had exchanged words.[7] Of all the women on the show Pollard had the most tension with Thompson all throughout the show. Pollard vowed to \"whoop Pumkin's ass\", and attempted to do so at the season one reunion.[8] The moment was rated number one on various VH1 and MTV reality show specials, including VH1's 20 Greatest Celebreality Fights.[citation needed] The final two contestants journeyed to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where Flavor Flav chose Nicole \"Hoopz\" Alexander over Pollard, to be his mate.[9]\n\nFlavor of Love 2 [ edit ]\n\nAfter his relationship did not work out with Alexander, Flavor Flav chose to do a second season of his dating show and invited Pollard (then age 24) to help him eliminate contestants halfway through the season. She agreed and was later added as a participant.[10] In the finale, Flav chose Deelishis over Pollard.[11] Pollard verbally fought with Flav in the season finale, asking why he had brought her back only to be ultimately eliminated.[12]\n\nVH1 spinoffs [ edit ]\n\nI Love New York [ edit ]\n\nI Love New York was Pollard's first reality television series on VH1. The series is a spin-off of another relationship competition series, the Flavor of Love, which featured Pollard as a finalist in two consecutive seasons. In July 2006, VH1 published a casting call for contestants for a new series tentatively titled The Flavorette. Various blogs speculated that the star of this program could be Flavor of Love season 1 contestant Rain, Hoopz (Nicole Alexander) or Pollard. Before the season 2 Flavor of Love finale, Pollard denied having her own show but after the finale aired, she confirmed she was the \"Flavorette\" and that she was already down to the final three contestants. The show premiered on Monday, January 8, 2007, and was the most-watched series debut in VH1 history with 4.426 million viewers.[13] Its season 1 finale brought in 4.8M million viewers and its reunion show ratings held 5.01 million viewers. Spin-offs from the series include I Love Money, New York Goes to Hollywood, Real Chance of Love, New York Goes to Work, and Frank the Entertainer in a Basement Affair.\n\nI Love New York 2 [ edit ]\n\nI Love New York 2 premiered October 8, 2007 on VH1.[14] In the finale of I Love New York 2, contestant \"Tailor Made\" (real name George Weisgerber) proposed to Pollard, but was turned down. The finale earned 5.4 million viewers. During the I Love New York 2 reunion special, Tailor Made proposed a second time and Pollard accepted. The reunion special earned 4.86 million viewers.[15][16]\n\nNew York Goes to Hollywood [ edit ]\n\nNew York Goes to Hollywood premiered August 4, 2008 on VH1.

The reality show followed Pollard as she searches for a regular job.[17] The jobs were selected by fans (via text messaging) from a list of three possible jobs for each episode. Pollard would receive a $10,000 bonus each week if she were able to impress her employer. However, if she quit, failed, or was fired, she would not receive a bonus for the week. Pollard won $45,000 over the series, and earned bonuses in four jobs (in episodes 1, 2, 5, and 6); she lost, failed in, or quit four jobs (in episodes 3, 4, 7, and 8); and come to a draw in the season finale. At the end of the series, a mobile poll was presented giving three choices for New York's next task, and the most votes were cast for I Love New York 3.\n\nI Love New York 3 [ edit ]\n\nProduction for I Love New York 3 was set to kick off sometime in the first quarter of 2010; however, prior to that time frame, VH1 requested immediate cancellation of the \"celebreality\" franchise and shelved plans for I Love New York 3. In the summer of 2011, Pollard hinted that I Love New York 3 was cancelled due to the murder-suicide case of Ryan Jenkins, who was a former contestant of Megan Wants a Millionaire.[18]\n\nBrunch with Tiffany [ edit ]\n\nIn 2020, Pollard's VH1 digital series Brunch with Tiffany, was picked up by the VH1 television network.
