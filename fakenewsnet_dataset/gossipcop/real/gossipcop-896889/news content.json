Amber Portwood\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9 Matt Baier has tied the knot.\n\nPEOPLE confirms Baier, who split from Portwood earlier this summer, married Jennifer Kathleen Conlon in Las Vegas on Tuesday.\n\nBaier, 46, spoke to E! News about his nuptials, saying he had met Conlon in a restaurant in Las Vegas following his break up from Portwood, 26.\n\nAccording to the outlet, they couple have been together for about six months, but kept their relationship private because \u201cshe\u2019s not a public figure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was one of those situations where it just kind of felt like the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really get each other. We both have overcome a lot of stuff. It felt like the right thing to do. It just kind of happened that way.\u201d\n\nBaier, 46, and Portwood, 27, had planned for an October wedding, but broke up while filming Marriage Boot Camp earlier this summer after three years together.\n\nRich Polk/Getty\n\nThey hit a rough patch last August when reports surfaced that Baier was facing legal trouble for failing to paying child support to multiple other women for several secret biological children. While Baier and Portwood don\u2019t share any children, she is mom to 8-year-old Leah with ex Gary Shirley.\n\nThings seemed to finally end between them when Portwood became aware that Baier, a recovering addict, had offered her Teen Mom OG costar Catelynn Lowell Baltierra a Xanax as she was experiencing a panic attack.\n\nAfter their split, Portwood opened up about rediscovering herself while being single on Dr. Drew Pinsky\u2019s podcast, This Life #YouLive, in July, telling the TMOG reunion host she and Baier haven\u2019t cut off communication but weren\u2019t exactly in peace talks.\n\n\u201cWe are talking, but we\u2019re not talking in a sense that we\u2019re going to get back together,\u201d Portwood said. \u201cWe argue too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI personally am just trying to better myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI just kind of lost myself, my independence as a woman [and] as a person because I was too focused on Matt.\u201d\n\nPortwood has definitely moved on, with PEOPLE confirming her second pregnancy in early November with boyfriend Andrew Glennon\u2019s child.\n\nA couple of days later, the reality star tweeted her thanks to her followers for their supportive responses to news of her pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThank you everyone for all the kind words. I\u2019m very excited for my future with Andrew and our little family we are starting together! Love,\u201d she tweeted.", "images":
