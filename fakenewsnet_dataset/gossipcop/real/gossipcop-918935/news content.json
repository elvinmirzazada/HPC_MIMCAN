My favorite thing about being engaged is just a sense of warmth and just joy.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s everything we know about the couple\u2019s wedding.\n\nJason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nThey Can\u2019t Wait for Their Big Day\n\nThe countdown is on for their wedding, and the couple can\u2019t wait to tie the knot!\n\nHough gushed about Laich in a sweet lovey-dovey Instagram post in early June, calling him, \u201cMy best friend, my hero, my everything!\u201d She added: \u201cI am completely and utterly madly in love with you!\u201d\n\nIn celebration of his birthday in June, she shared two adorable throwback photos from her soon-to-be husband\u2019s birthday party, which was celebrated by the pool. \u201c#tbt celebrating this hunks birthday! @brookslaich \ud83d\udc99 That flame will never go out\u2026 \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\u201d Hough captioned a video that was captured at the celebratory affair. She followed it up with an image of the engaged couple sharing a smooch: \u201c#tbt Birthday kisses \ud83d\udc8b.\u201d\n\nThe NHL player also expressed his love for Hough (and their two pups!) recently. #wcw on these two angels!\u201d he captioned a photo of her cuddling up to one of the couple\u2019s beloved pups \u2014 Lexi \u2014 on a hike overlooking Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t get our other girl Harley out from the shade of the tree for the photo\u2026..I\u2019m a lucky man to be surrounded by love like this!!\u201d\n\nThere Will Be Lots of Dancing\n\nOne key element that will definitely be incorporated into the couple\u2019s big day is dancing.\n\n\u201cOh my goodness, he wants more than anything to dance,\u201d Hough told PEOPLE in September 2015 about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s desire to show off his moves at the wedding. \u201cHe\u2019s always wanted to dance before he ever met me, so he\u2019s always asking me to teach him and I\u2019m like, \u2018Ask Derek!\u2019 I\u2019m just pawning my brother off to him. So I think Derek and Brooks might have a first dance. That would be interesting, and a sight to see for sure.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE Now in December, the DWTS judge said that Laich is keen on doing a choreographed first dance at the reception. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny because he really wants to do a first dance. And that\u2019s more on him. Like, he wants to do it,\u201d said Hough. \u201cI was like, \u2018Of course I\u2019ll help you and teach you and we can do some stuff. But why don\u2019t you ask, like, Derek [Hough]. I mean, he\u2019s a dancer. He\u2019ll help you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat idea didn\u2019t sit well with Laich. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Why would I want Derek to teach me versus my fianc\u00e8e who\u2019s my best friend,\u2019 \u201d said Hough.\n\nSpeaking with Harry Connick Jr. in May, Hough dished on the choreographed number that they\u2019ll showcase at the reception.\n\n\u201cI was always under the impression that we would just get up there and do a little side-to-side dancing,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s like, \u2018No, I want a full-on choreographed routine!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always wanted to dance,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Okay, well I\u2019m going to have to teach you, and you\u2019re going to have to listen.\u2019 \u201c\n\nMusic Is a Priority\n\nHough is hoping that her guests will be able to dance the night away to the tunes of one of her favorite musicians \u2014 and she\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to pull out all the favors,\u201d she told Entertainment Tonight about getting Norwegian superstar DJ Kygo to perform. Hough said she\u2019s even open to reaching out to Selena Gomez, who recently collaborated with Kygo, to see if the singer is able to \u201cpull some strings\u201d in her favor!\n\nAnd if big brother Derek could pull some strings, a certain singer would be performing at her big day.\n\n\u201cYou know who I want to get? Michael Bubl\u00e9. I mean he won\u2019t. He can\u2019t possibly go, but it\u2019d be amazing if he just sort of rose from the ground and was like \u2018Hello!\u201d and started singing!\u201d Derek told PEOPLE Now in June.\n\nIt\u2019s a Pup-Friendly Affair\n\nHough\u2019s love for her two pups \u2014 Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Lexi and Harley \u2014 is evident \u2014 and her wedding day will be no exception!\n\nThe two very special ladies will be included in her bridal party, according to the bride-to-be.\n\n\u201cThey will definitely be running down the aisle at some point,\u201d she told PEOPLE. \u201cFor sure, probably wearing little ribbons and bows, the whole nine yards. I haven\u2019t told Brooks yet, but that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ll Be Surrounded by Close Friends & Family\n\n\n\nThough Hough and Laich both compete and perform in front of millions of eyes on national TV, they\u2019re hoping for something much smaller when it comes to their wedding day.\n\nLast June, she told PEOPLE that the magical night will include \u201cmainly just friends and family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re keeping it pretty small and intimate,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of them know each other, so it\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\nBig brother Derek Hough also hinted \u2014 shortly after the duo got engaged \u2014 at what he expects the big day to be like. \u201cSomething outdoors, in nature,\u201d he said. \u201cSentimental. Something special to us. I have an idea where it\u2019s going to be. \u2026 It\u2019s going to be amazing.\u201d\n\nBut even though they\u2019re aiming to keep attendees to only closest friends and family members, Hough admitted to Entertainment Tonight that it will still be a full guest list.\n\n\u201cI have a really big family. Brooks has sort of a moderate-sized family, so regardless of how small we want it, it\u2019s still going to be big,\u201d she said.\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Cost of Dancing With the Stars\u2018 Mirrorball Trophy\n\nThey\u2019ll Have an Epic Wedding Guest List\n\nHough and her beau may want to keep the celebration on the smaller side, but there\u2019s a few famous faces that we can almost guarantee will be in attendance.\n\nIn addition to her BFF Nina Dobrev \u2014 who documented Julianne\u2019s Mexico-set bachelorette party in early March on social media \u2014 we presume the former DWTS pro and current judge will most likely invite longtime friend and dancing pro Mark Ballas, actress Nikki Reed, Monique Lhuillier and Aaron and Lauren Paul.\n\nShe Wants to Look Like Herself\n\nHough will have all eyes on her when she\u2019s the brushing bride in white, but she definitely wants to look like herself when the big day arrives.\n\n\u201cI want my wedding to feel glamorous, but timeless. And I think it goes from head to toe with your hair, your makeup, your dress and what you smell like,\u201d Hough told PEOPLE in December, who maintains she wants to \u201clook like me.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her hair and makeup, she aims to maintain her overall physical appearance as she prepares for her wedding day.\n\n\u201cIf I get super hot for my wedding day and I\u2019m not afterwards, and I\u2019m not before, then it\u2019s like, \u2018Who is this person marrying my fianc\u00e9?\u2019 Or, \u2018Who\u2019s my fianc\u00e9 marrying?\u2019 \u201d Hough told PEOPLE in early March. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look different than what I look like normally.\u201d", "images":
