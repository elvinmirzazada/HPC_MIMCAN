And there have been no shortage of cringey finales. He then reconciled with runner-up contestant Lauren Burnham, a 25-year-old from Virginia.\n\nABC Becca Ring Arie Bachelor\n\nBut Kufrin\u2019s devoted fans managed to find her account on Venmo, an app that lets you send and receive money, to fund her recovery in the form of booze and pampering \u2014 with messages of love and support. Users ultimately sent her $6,000, suggesting she use it to buy everything from cocktails and cheap wine to vacations and even a puppy, according to People.\n\nThe fact that people are sending @thebkoof money for wine on Venmo has me SHOOK #TheBachelor pic.twitter.com/OFe6kDlMWd \u2014 Danielle Espinoza (@itsdjespinoza) March 6, 2018\n\nOn the \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d special Tuesday, Kufrin, a 27-year-old publicist from Minnesota, told host Chris Harrison, \u201cI love my wine, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I don\u2019t think I can drink that much.\u201d\n\nShe instead offered to donate the funds to Stand Up to Cancer, a nonprofit organization researching cures for the disease. Harrison quickly offered to match that amount on behalf of the show.\n\nI knew I liked this girl! Thanks @thebkoof! I just learned that Becca Kufrin is donating $6000 dollars to @SU2C! And thanks to @BachelorABC for matching it! Call me when this is over and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find you a cute guy! #bachelor #su2c https://t.co/3ezdLbLDBO \u2014 Katie Couric (@katiecouric) March 7, 2018\n\nFans certainly aren\u2019t thrilled with how \"The Bachelor\" ended this season, airing unedited footage of the brutal breakup. Many took to social media, posting that they felt like it was a ratings grab at Kufrin's expense.\n\nWill everyone continue watching furure seasons? Im conflicted. I feel the producers lured Becca to the weekend getaway only to blindside her and film her breakup. It's unethical. I would appreciate any thoughts. #TheBachelor \u2014 Loren (@bachelorholic) March 7, 2018\n\nLuyendyk and his new fianc\u00e9e Burnham later appeared on \u201cAfter the Final Rose\u201d and told People they have plans to marry this year.\n\nABC THE BACHELOR - \"Episode 2210\" - The compelling live three-hour television event will begin with America watching along with the studio audience as Arie Luyendyk Jr.'s journey to find love comes to its astonishing conclusion. The Bachelor prepares to make one of the most difficult choices of his life, having narrowed down the field to two women with whom he is madly in love - Becca K. and Lauren B. - and told both of them that he loves them.\n\nBut it seems like Kufrin will have more than bottles of wine and her favorite foods to take her mind off of Luyendyk soon, as the show announced that she will be the next \u201cBachelorette.\u201d Former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay summed it up perfectly on Twitter:\n\nHeartache is always a pit stop on #thebachelor journey but once you become #thebachelorette, you are in the driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat and you can control your own happy ending. Go get it girl!!! Congrats @thebkoof \u2014 Rachel Lindsay (@TheRachLindsay) March 7, 2018\n\nWhile Kufrin may not have her happy ending yet, she's certainly made a lot of people happy with her $6,000 donation (well, now $12,000, thanks to Harrison!) to cancer research.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041801im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_pop_klg_bachelor_180116_1920x1080.today-inline-vid-featured-desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041801im_/https://c.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041801im_/https://nodeassets.today.com/cdnassets/today-images/tdy-header-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041801im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_10/1322646/arie-and-becca-today-inline-180306_a77db6ec506798bd97de496049336043.today-inline-large.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041801im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_10/1322394/the-bachelor-arie_luyendyk-jr-lauren-b-today-180304-tease_59e42e640847a0daad778920e58a8e95.today-inline-large.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041801im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2018_10/1322834/bachelorette-today-tease-2-180307_808e934244de6a534451ba966b1f08f5.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041801im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2018_10/1322834/bachelorette-today-tease-2-180307_808e934244de6a534451ba966b1f08f5.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lyn Mettler"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041801/https://www.today.com/food/bachelorette-becca-kufrin-donates-6-000-worth-beer-money-fans-t124631", "title": "'Bachelorette' Becca Kufrin donates $6,000 worth of 'beer money' from fans", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width initial-scale=1 maximum-scale=1 user-scalable=no", "msvalidate.01": "43434ADDF3F60D7897F819F388E2FADF", "author": "Lyn Mettler", "og": {"description": "After fans sent 'Bachelorette' Becca Kufrin $6,000 to mend her broken heart with booze and food, she is donating the funds to a good cause.", "title": "'Bachelorette' Becca Kufrin donates $6,000 worth of 'beer money' from fans", "site_name": "TODAY.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041801im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2018_10/1322834/bachelorette-today-tease-2-180307_808e934244de6a534451ba966b1f08f5.jpg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180308041801/https://www.today.com/food/bachelorette-becca-kufrin-donates-6-000-worth-beer-money-fans-t124631"}, "description": "After fans sent 'Bachelorette' Becca Kufrin $6,000 to mend her broken heart with booze and food, she is donating the funds to a good cause.", "twitter": {"title": "'Bachelorette' Becca Kufrin donates $6,000 worth of 'beer money' from fans", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TodayShow", "description": "After fans sent 'Bachelorette' Becca Kufrin $6,000 to mend her broken heart with booze and food, she is donating the funds to a good cause.", "creator": "@TodayShow", "domain": "TODAY.com", "image": {"src": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_10/1322834/bachelorette-today-tease-2-180307_808e934244de6a534451ba966b1f08f5.today-inline-vid-featured-desktop.jpg"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "parsely-post-id": 124631, "news_keywords": "Trending,Food,Pop Culture,Trends", "google-site-verification": "uDRXhvw8LRHhorJhIUmXCkUPjqGebM6KFh9jZGwH6VA", "DC.date.issued": "2018-03-07T20:36:00.000Z", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699, affiliate-data=ct=todaycom_sb&pt=211554, app-argument=https://www.today.com/food/bachelorette-becca-kufrin-donates-6-000-worth-beer-money-fans-t124631"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
