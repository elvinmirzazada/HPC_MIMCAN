And though it\u2019s easy to assume that the 31-year-old actress wakes up perfectly glammed every morning, her hairstylist, Laura Polko, is here to tell us that that is far from the case. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the secret to the \u201cGlee\u201d star\u2019s hair isn\u2019t easy, either\u2014in fact, it lies in the palm of your hand. (Literally.)\n\nIn an interview with E! News, Polko\u2014who has also worked with big names like Gigi Hadid, Chrissy Teigen, and Adriana Lima\u2014revealed that her hack for faking Michele\u2019s signature \u201csecond-day hair\u201d (even on day one) is mixing texture spray with coconut oil\u2014a.k.a. the holy grail of everything beauty.\n\nSpecifically, Polko uses IGK\u2019s Rich Kid Coconut Oil Gel and Beach Club Texture Spray, which she mixes in her hands to give \u201cgrit\u201d to clean hair. Not only does the mixture provide natural-looking texture, but by mixing the spray with the coconut oil, Polko is better able to control how she works in the product than if she used the spray alone. \u201cI like to put it together because if I\u2019m working it in, then I more evenly distribute it,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter slathering the concoction in your hair, Polko\u2019s final trick is blowdrying or rough-drying the hair to add extra volume and texture. Then that\u2019s it\u2014it\u2019s ready to be styled into a voluminous ponytail or worn as is. (See E! News\u2019s tutorial below.)\n\nNot like you needed another reason to stock your beauty shelves with coconut oil, but accomplishing Lea Michele-style hair is definitely a plus.", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetabercrombiejeans.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/root-cover-up-fi.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1-Square.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lea-michele1.jpg", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Robin-Hollander.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kleemorganicseyecream.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/makari-serum-fi.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/applying-hair-oil-adobe.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lush-advent-cal.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/how-cory-monteith-die-e1689261484223.jpg?w=2775&h=1657&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ytp-eye-cream-fi.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/masked-singer-gazelle-janel-parrish.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetsweaterset.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lea-michele1.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/daisy-jones-and-the-six.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RemiBader_Homepage.webp?w=244", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/leah-michele.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/spotify-wrapped-2023-bgr-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nativaspa-cyber-monday.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://spy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sdfgve.png?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ulta-hair-sale.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uggdupestarget.gif?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/olivercabellsneakersale.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bestprodsforthinninghair.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/new-song-jesus-and-mary-chain.jpg?resize=232,175"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lea-michele1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Pham"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/beauty/hair-nails/709367/lea-michele-hairstylist-second-day-hair-hack-coconut-oil-texture-spray/", "title": "Lea Michele\u2019s Hairstylist\u2019s Mixes Texture Spray with Coconut Oil to Fake Second-Day Hair", "meta_data": {"description": "Actress Lea Michele's hairstylist Laura Polko's hack for faking second-day hair is mixing texture spray and coconut oil in the palms of her hands, and working it into clean locks.
