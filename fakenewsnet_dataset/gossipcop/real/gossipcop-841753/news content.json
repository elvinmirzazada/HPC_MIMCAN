Check out shirtless pics of Hollywood's sexiest leading men, including Chris Pratt, Josh Duhamel, Matt Bomer, Channing Tatum, and more.\n\nThe Tonight Show host, 42, who is promoting his new Race Through New York ride at the theme park, challenged the Fate of the Furious star, 44, to play Race Through Universal Studios, which entailed dressing up as mascot versions of themselves. The stars attempted to score as many fan high-fives (worth one point), hugs (worth three points) and photos (worth five points) as they could in three minutes.\n\nAfter dashing around the park and interacting with dozens of tourists, the final tally showed Fallon was the winner with 111 points to Johnson\u2019s 103. The comedian took off his mascot head and celebrated as a huge crowd gathered to watch.\n\nRelated: Celebrities at Theme Parks Check out funny, cute photos of celebrities at theme parks including Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes' Disneyland date and Kate Hudson's merry-go-round ride with her son\n\n\u201cWhile we have this on, want to go upstairs and photobomb some people?\u201d Fallon asked, to which the WWE star replied, \u201cUmm, what\u2019s that term?

In the background, the pair chest bumped, dabbed, twerked and tried on tiny hats, and at one point, they hilariously swapped heads. After the photos, they removed their heads and revealed their real identities to the delight of the tourists.\n\nRelated: Fast and the Furious Franchise Through the Years They don\u2019t have friends \u2014 they have family.

Back in 2001, few viewers could have imagined that the first entry in the series, The Fast and the Furious, would spawn even one sequel, let alone a multibillion-dollar [\u2026]\n\nOne visitor got particularly excited when the Baywatch actor\u2019s mascot emerged. \u201cThe Rock! My man, my hero since I was, like, 5 years old,\u201d the man said, unaware that the real Johnson was under the cartoon head.\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
