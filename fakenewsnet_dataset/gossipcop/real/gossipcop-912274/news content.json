She was an amazing woman and it was a true honor.\u201d\n\nDebra tells PEOPLE she thinks \u201cit\u2019s classless\u201d and \u201cexploitative.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who it is acting in it \u2013 it\u2019s just tasteless,\u201d Debra says. \u201cIt\u2019s classless how everyone is rushing to release something for the 50th anniversary of this horrific event.\u201d\n\nDebra, who was 16 when her sister was murdered by Charles Manson\u2019s cult followers, also commented on what she believed was the premise of the film: A scene in which her sister has a premonition that she and former boyfriend and hairstylist Jay Sebring would have their throats slit \u2014 an eerie similarity to how their actual deaths occurred.\n\nHilary Duff/Instagram; Michael Ochs Archives/Getty\n\nShe says the dream is false.\n\n\u201cI know for a fact she did not have a premonition \u2014 awake or in a dream \u2014 that she and Jay would have their throat cut,\u201d she says. \u201cI checked with all of her living friends. None of her friends had any knowledge of this. Tacky, tacky, tacky.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cIt\u2019s a total fabrication.\u201d\n\nTate, 26 at the time of her death, was married to director Roman Polanski and was eight-and-a-half months pregnant with their first child \u2014 a boy \u2014 when she was stabbed repeatedly in her home.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Cult Leader Charles Manson, Whose 1969 Murders Horrified the Nation, Dead at 83\n\nSebring, Abigail Folger, Wojciech Frykowski and Steven Parent were also stabbed at the home of the actress, whose blood was used to write on the walls.\n\nDebra says she owns the rights to her sister\u2019s likeness.\n\n\u201cIt would have been nice if someone had contacted me,\u201d she says of the upcoming independent film.\n\nManson died in November at the age of 83. He was serving nine life sentences in California\u2019s Corcoran State Prison at the time of his death.\n\n\u201cI said a prayer for his soul,\u201d Debra said of the moment after she received a call from a prison official informing her of Manson\u2019s death.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/N2AJuJM0LZ9akFnf3KYIDeQfDcU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(739x452:741x454)/jay-allen-new-single-041823-tout-2000-787477ddd25749afa69be984811e0641.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0weHtH8X10SGtksx6eBoiTZgX_o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(689x0:691x2)/charles-manson-2-7280cf03e87f43259905f85dd16671f5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/DTQorPKplQ7fOqm1nsijpC9_dos=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(997x649:999x651)/spider-man-spiderverse-1-189c3f0fe8604eb09a95c7daefd2cdfb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2An2AXMf9s_V6nhOoCXvxlB1Y5A=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/A-Haunting-in-Venice-1-091123-cbdcf4d80ced4696ae0aa1e813eaa382.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/S5KLLOgqcbf_-1FPCCOo25wPBck=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1005x582:1007x584)/celine-dion-kids-1-0bca00eee0bc4a8abc141e7dd1fb5c81.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/p59pCo344i0_rNdqBqhEEvBxyQM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(319x0:321x2)/people_social_image-60e0c8af9eb14624a5b55f2c29dbe25b.png", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/a3Nvr1QwqhNhm0mqibWanhFkzHQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x580:1021x582)/Linda-Kasabian-022823-2000-cd9b3c5076344167be8f1e696f3f2a3e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/b-cv3y7x0CPaInSJWrICehfOxbg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x189:736x191)/Gavin-Newsom-Patricia-Krenwinkel-101522-Split-37aa9c1094814f069556aeef7f7c4899.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/cgls4IoMUjVL-Vfi-nHrABJnaJw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1479x379:1481x381)/amy-schumer-f9b0cb733baf432ba32b594b388e8ecb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/6ep1m56XNZhmsiHnR1vv-p6D4Rs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1147x540:1149x542)/guy-ritchie-the-covenant-1-0a51e1f8715e48d0915b0a6717023642.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NsfMUvhCxXeb-4eUg_CxBZy0PMo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x626:961x628)/hilary-duff-matthew-koma-1-602c94c9f93940a990358632ee0b6026.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9Tty860YZ3M_XVs-bs0PUij2x4Y=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x459:736x461)/tristyn-bailey-aiden-fucci-39d70913b28e4fe3b3a1b143258a01b3.jpeg", "https://people.com/thmb/C7M2ExabO9jYQHLXwZi7VgIfisA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x359:1001x361)/beach-boys-1-ac85df6fc01644bfb2be6890c20671d5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/i2W6T4OeqUBp5KKZN_59UUznyMI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/michael-fassbender-stars-in-the-killer-082923-01-a79f16efdc9f4448b025672416c4430d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-OQ8zFnemC1bAy5DTWpseQoz2mA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(599x0:601x2)/hilary-duff-sharon-tate-4c3da13654ff47ae84f25e701801d5f1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qxx8UpkQICb0yvIywZAjL2iHy3k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x539:981x541)/only-murders-in-the-building-1-9fab80a64a654ca5a1fcb48d15aa2d13.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2jhj08m5ErwxW9VE0P9VyIZqRto=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x584:1001x586)/gwyneth-paltrow-parents-1-9464b8e686ff4cdaa64a89c3e0f7338f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/dO9uykCCK3ai13uBb3YR5_7m1EM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(982x491:984x493)/till-murder-do-us-part-soering-vs-haysom-1-16ba2fc5de34464bba617791008ba9fa.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/p59pCo344i0_rNdqBqhEEvBxyQM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(319x0:321x2)/people_social_image-60e0c8af9eb14624a5b55f2c29dbe25b.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elaine Aradillas", "Elaine Aradillas Is A Former Senior Staff Writer People.
