Without hesitation, Wintour quipped: \u201cDonald Trump.\u201d\n\nWintour was a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election against Trump. In October of that year, Vogue officially endorsed Clinton, marking the first time the magazine had ever publicly endorsed a presidential candidate. \u201cObviously we felt it was a moment in history for women,\u201d Wintour told the Wall Street Journal at the time. \u201cAt times like that you need to take a leadership position\u2026. To me, it was in support of women.\u201d\n\nStill, readers can expect to see First Lady Melania Trump within the pages of the fashion magazine. \u201cWe have a tradition of always covering whoever is the first lady at Vogue,\u201d she told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t imagine that this time would be any different.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Activists!
