In particular, some winners that have only played once. I feel it's their time to come back and, if they deserve to be in the top five or the top three, they should go play again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell people, when I got off the first time, I had an innate desire like, I gotta go back,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe second time was about 10 times more work, because you're fighting off a persona. All these people know all this stuff about you. So, it's a lot more work and, when I'm there, my brain doesn't shut off. I wouldn't want to do it again.\u201d\n\nSee more on the reality series below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2017-09/pic_cbs_nicole_franzel.jpg?h=34284063&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/dan_gheesling_gettyimages-82850261.jpg?h=205debf0", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fet_090617_BigBrotherDan720.png%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-03%2Fdan_gheesling_gettyimages-82850261.jpg%3Fh%3D205debf0&w=1024&q=100", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-03%2Fchristmas_abbott_gettyimages-614776670-min.jpg%3Fh%3D6d472564&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fet_REDCRPT_JulieChen_022618.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/dan_gheesling_gettyimages-82850261.jpg?h=205debf0", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/big-brother-winner-dan-gheesling-welcomes-baby-no-2-see-the-pic-98263", "title": "'Big Brother' Winner Dan Gheesling Welcomes Baby No. 2 -- See the Pic!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/dan_gheesling_gettyimages-82850261.jpg?h=205debf0", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "It's another boy for the 'Big Brother' season 10 winner.", "title": "'Big Brother' Winner Dan Gheesling Welcomes Baby No. 2 -- See the Pic!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/big-brother-winner-dan-gheesling-welcomes-baby-no-2-see-the-pic-98263", "type": "Article"}, "description": "It's another boy for the 'Big Brother' season 10 winner.", "twitter": {"description": "It's another boy for the 'Big Brother' season 10 winner.", "title": "'Big Brother' Winner Dan Gheesling Welcomes Baby No. 2 -- See the Pic!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/big-brother-winner-dan-gheesling-welcomes-baby-no-2-see-the-pic-98263", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/dan_gheesling_gettyimages-82850261.jpg?h=205debf0", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "'Big Brother' Winner Dan Gheesling Welcomes Baby No. 2 -- See the Pic! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, Dan Gheesling, Big Brother, Babies & Kids", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
