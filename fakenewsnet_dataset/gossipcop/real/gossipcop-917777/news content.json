We weren\u2019t even sure if the cells would take,\u201d Streisand explained, adding, \u201cA friend had cloned his beloved dog, and I was very impressed with that dog.\u201d\n\nKMazur/WireImage\n\nWhile anxiously waiting for the test results to determine whether cloning was possible, Streisand adopted not one, but two dogs in the absence of Sammie.\n\nThe first was a rescue: Maltipoo dog Sadie, who is lovingly named after her first dog which was gifted to her by the cast of Funny Girl when she turned 22.\n\nAnd the second was a straight-haired Coton de Tulear named Miss Fanny, whom Streisand got from Sammie\u2019s breeder after it was revealed that Miss Fanny\u2019s mother is named Funny Girl.\n\nAfter welcoming two four-legged members into her family, Streisand was surprised with the call she had been anticipating.\n\n\u201cNot only did the cloning process take, but it produced four puppies! Unfortunately, the runt of the litter died before the puppies were old enough to be delivered to me,\u201d she said.\n\nSo the puppies plus Sadie and Miss Fanny meant she suddenly had five dogs in her home \u2014 which she admitted was a lot even for her.\n\nDescribing herself as a \u201cperson who was used to taking my dog everywhere with me, and who never had more than one dog at a time living in my house,\u201d Streisand said she chose to give away Sadie to her manager\u2019s assistant and one of the puppies to the teenage daughter of her A&R rep.\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of cats, dogs and other furry friends?

But we love them so much. Each puppy is unique and has her own personality,\u201d Streisand said, though she added: You can clone the look of a dog, but you can\u2019t clone the soul. Still, every time I look at their faces, I think of my Samantha\u2026and smile.\u201d", "images":
