It will now be recognised.\u201d\n\nAbbott moved an amendment he said protected discrimination against anyone over their \u201cconscientious view about the nature of marriage\u201d, before saying he planned to attend his gay sister\u2019s wedding next year.\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to attending the marriage of my sister, Christine, to her partner Virginia some time early in the new year.\u201d\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Lawmaker proposes to gay partner in parliament", "images": ["https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/768x768/public/images/methode/2017/12/04/999e3bd8-d8b0-11e7-91af-f34de211f924_1280x720_131203.JPG?itok=3kcG9Eur", "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_scmp_120/public/images/methode/2017/12/04/88fed4f0-d8af-11e7-91af-f34de211f924_image_hires_131203.JPG?itok=IR6ALqhP&v=1512364326", "https://assets-v2.i-scmp.com/production/_next/static/media/wheel-on-gray.af4a55f9.gif", "https://img.i-scmp.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=contain,width=60,format=auto/sites/default/files/styles/118x118/public/d8/images/author/pic/2023/07/17/image-(28).png?itok=xML2J2Ym"], "top_img": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_scmp_120/public/images/methode/2017/12/04/88fed4f0-d8af-11e7-91af-f34de211f924_image_hires_131203.JPG?itok=IR6ALqhP&v=1512364326", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "canonical_link": "https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/2122747/australian-lawmaker-proposes-gay-partner-parliament-speech", "title": "Australian lawmaker proposes to gay partner in parliament speech", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Tim Wilson at the end of his speech popped the question to his partner of seven years Ryan Bolger, who was watching from the public gallery", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SCMPNews"}, "fb": {"app_id": 282931841805811}, "og": {"title": "Watch Australian lawmaker make marriage proposal during speech", "description": "Tim Wilson at the end of his speech popped the question to his partner of seven years Ryan Bolger, who was watching from the public gallery", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/australasia/article/2122747/australian-lawmaker-proposes-gay-partner-parliament-speech", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_scmp_120/public/images/methode/2017/12/04/88fed4f0-d8af-11e7-91af-f34de211f924_image_hires_131203.JPG?itok=IR6ALqhP&v=1512364326", "site_name": "South China Morning Post"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_store_id": 623201967, "app_name": "SCMP", "url": "scmp://news/asia/australasia/article/2122747/australian-lawmaker-proposes-gay-partner-parliament-speech?entity=node&type=article&id=2122747"}, "android": {"package": "com.scmp.newspulse", "app_name": "SCMP", "url": "scmp://news/asia/australasia/article/2122747/australian-lawmaker-proposes-gay-partner-parliament-speech?entity=node&type=article&id=2122747"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=623201967", "keywords": "Tim Wilson, gay, marriage", "news_keywords": "Tim Wilson, gay, marriage", "article": {"section": "Australasia", "tag": "LGBTQ", "published_time": "2017-12-04T13:12:06+08:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-04T20:58:42+08:00"}, "pocket-site-verification": "25fd909c3fd10ded451415fc076ba8", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1", "cXenseParse": {"articleid": 2122747, "author": "Agence France-Presse", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/768x768/public/images/methode/2017/12/04/88fed4f0-d8af-11e7-91af-f34de211f924_image_hires_131203.JPG?itok=zXyvAvW7&v=1512364326"}, "next-head-count": 45}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512364326.0, "source": "https://www.scmp.com", "summary": ""}
