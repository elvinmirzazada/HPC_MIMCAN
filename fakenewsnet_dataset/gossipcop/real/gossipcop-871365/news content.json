Another shelter is at Grant Park South, located at 325 South Michigan Avenue between East Jackson Boulevard and East Van Buren. Another shelter is at the Millennium Lakeside garage located at 5 South Columbus Drive, between East Monroe and East Randolph streets.\n\nThere are signs to direct people to these locations. Safety officials will be available to give directions.\n\nMore than 170 performers will hit eight stages at this year's four-day music fest. Wiz Kalifa, Lorde, Muse and Cage the Elephant were a few of Thursday's headliners.

Large bags are prohibited and all bags will be searched. Attendees can re-enter up to three times per day.\n\nCLICK HERE for additional information on allowed and prohibited items, as well as tips for attending Lollapalooza, click here.\n\nAbout 100,000 people are expected to attend Lollapalooza each day. Although general admission packages quickly sold out, there is an official ticket exchange where people can buy and sell tickets at lollapalooza.com.\n\n\"We have a plan of a schedule that we want to go see. But, you know, it falls to pieces and you really see whoever sounds good,\" said Blake Shreves, who arrived early for the music festival.\n\n\"The storms? Actually, I look forward to the storms. All the dirt on the inside turns into a mudslide. It's one big party. Love it,\" said Gavin Humfleet, who also arrived early for Lolla.\n\nParking will be available, but public transportation is probably the best to get to Grant Park. Lollapalooza organizers arranged shuttles from several different suburban locations. Divvy will have special valet service at the Jackson and Michigan station for bike riders.", "images": ["https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/13589397_ravibaichwal_160x200.png", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/12986202_032123-wls-lolla-lineup-11avo-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/2270944_080217-wls-lolla-10p-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14117969_112923-wls-ap-josh-giddey-img.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/355088_101714-wls-metra-img.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/233229_080114-wls-lolla-cover-img.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.net/abcotv/assets/news/wls/images/logos/origin.png", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/2267476_080117-wls-lolla-5p-2-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/1813016_032217-wls-lolla-1123a-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/2269697_080217-wcl-Lollapalooza-Workout-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14115172_112823-kabc-6pm-westminster-child-killed-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.net/abcotv/static/wls/logos/wls_logo_2x.png", "data:image/svg;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEElEQVR42mNkIAAYRxWAAQAG9gAKqv6+AwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14114290_112823-wls-corey-perry-430pvo-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/2273994_080317-wls-lolla-evac-better-img.jpg?w=1600", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/13614513_080723-wls-lolla-clean-up-karen-430p-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14117213_112923-wls-migrant-camp-chopperraw-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/13604664_080523-wls-cate-lolla-5p-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14115720_112823-wls-cate-proud-youth-fb-championships-10p-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/13610302_080623-wls-cate-lolla-10p-vid.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/2273994_080317-wls-lolla-evac-better-img.jpg?w=1600", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://abc7chicago.com/lollapalooza-lolla-2017-tickets/2271749/", "title": "Lollapalooza evacuated due to storms at end of 1st day", "meta_data": {"description": "Lollapalooza organizers evacuated Grant Park just after 9 p.m. on the first day of the music festival due to weather, bringing the festival's first day of performances to a close early.", "keywords": "lollapalooza, lolla, lolla 2017, lollapalooza 2017, lollapalooza tickets, lolla tickets, lolla schedule, lolla headliners, lolla wristbands, lollapalooza schedule, arcade fire, the killers, chance the rapper, muse, lorde", "tags": "live-music,outdoor-music,festival,music,lollapalooza,grant-park", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402259941, affiliate-data=ct=wls-smart-banner&pt=302756, app-argument=https://abc7chicago.com/story/2271749", "fb": {"app_id": 381722608635006, "pages": 165583971161}, "og": {"site_name": "ABC7 Chicago", "url": "https://abc7chicago.com/lollapalooza-lolla-2017-tickets/2271749/", "title": "Lollapalooza evacuated due to storms at end of 1st day", "description": "Lollapalooza organizers evacuated Grant Park just after 9 p.m. on the first day of the music festival due to weather, bringing the festival's first day of performances to a close early.", "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/2273994_080317-wls-lolla-evac-better-img.jpg?w=1600", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"site": "@abc7chicago", "creator": "@abc7chicago", "url": "https://abc7chicago.com/lollapalooza-lolla-2017-tickets/2271749/", "title": "Lollapalooza evacuated due to storms at end of 1st day", "description": "Lollapalooza organizers evacuated Grant Park just after 9 p.m. on the first day of the music festival due to weather, bringing the festival's first day of performances to a close early.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/2273994_080317-wls-lolla-evac-better-img.jpg?w=1600", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "wls", "googleplay": "wls"}, "id": {"iphone": 402259941, "googleplay": "com.abclocal.wls.news"}}}, "article": {"modified_time": "2017-08-04T03:28:59Z", "section": "entertainment"}, "title": "Lollapalooza evacuated due to storms at end of 1st day", "medium": "website", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abc7chicago.com", "summary": ""}
