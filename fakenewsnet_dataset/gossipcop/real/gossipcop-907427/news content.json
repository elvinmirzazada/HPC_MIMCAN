And I could see what he was doing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then he began to sort of fondle himself, and I was very scared.\u201d\n\nBraudy said that she had shared details of the incident with friends when it occurred, though she was advised by one not to say anything. \u201cPeople were frightened for me,\u201d she said.\n\nOn Thursday, The Hollywood Reporter published a story detailing Braudy\u2019s accusations against Douglas, who preemptively denied her claims in an interview with Deadline last week, though he did reveal Braudy\u2019s identity at the time.\n\nBraudy told THR that while she was working for Douglas, he made demeaning comments about her appearance, used inappropriate sexual language when speaking to her and masturbated in front of her.\n\nDouglas gave a statement to THR that include his assertion that \u201cat no time then did she express or display even the slightest feeling of discomfort working in our environment, or with me personally. That is because at no time, and under no circumstance, did I behave inappropriately toward her.\u201d\n\nIn his interview with Deadline, Douglas said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe that someone would cause someone else pain like this. Maybe she is disgruntled, her career didn\u2019t go the way she hoped, and she is holding this grudge. It has caused tremendous stress to me for something I believe I have nothing to regret or feel responsible for.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Douglas did not immediately respond to TheWrap\u2019s request for comment.\n\nWatch Braudy\u2019s interview above.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/marc-thorpe.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Michael-Douglas-Susan-Braudy.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Thomas-Augsberger.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/wonka-timothee-chalamet.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/oppenheimer-copy.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Michael-Douglas-Susan-Braudy.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas", "Ross A.
