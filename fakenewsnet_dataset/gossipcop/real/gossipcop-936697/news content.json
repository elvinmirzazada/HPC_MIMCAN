When we meet her, this other version of Regina, she\u2019s working in a bar. She\u2019s a little rough around the edges.\u201d\n\nParilla acknowledged that other returning characters will emphasize unfamiliar aspects of their personalities in the new season, but that this will be especially true for the Evil Queen: \u201cShe looks very different \u2014 she feels different.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s no longer in charge,\u201d Parrilla continued. \u201cThis version of Regina is something else. I\u2019m still discovering her. I think we\u2019re all still discovering who she is \u2014 it\u2019s refreshing.\u201d\n\nWhen a journalist wanted to know the name that the other characters will now call Regina, Parilla replied cagily, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you \u2014 you\u2019ll have to tune in.\u201d\n\nThis led series co-creator Edward Kitsis to quip, \u201c\u2018The Queen Formally Known as Regina\u2019 will also work.\u201d\n\nNew cast member Andrew J. West, who plays the adult version of Henry Mills, said that viewers will see Regina and Henry \u201cinteract in a way that you\u2019ve never seen them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cOnce\u201d co-creator Adam Horowitz pointed out that the pair\u2019s \u201crelationship is central to the show, and remains so.\u201d\n\nABC announced in May that Season 7, which launches Oct. 6, will be without such core cast members as Ginnifer Goodwin (Snow), Josh Dallas (Charming) and Jennifer Morrison (Emma).", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/helena-bonham-carter-nolly-pbs.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/TheAfterparty_201_03336F-scaled.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/145970_1679-900x0.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/friday-night-lights-connie-britton.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/145970_1679-900x0.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-afterparty-season-2.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/145970_1679-900x0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Gajewski", "Natalie Oganesyan", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/once-upon-a-time-lana-parrilla-regina-season-7/", "title": "\u2018Once Upon a Time\u2019 Star Lana Parrilla Won\u2019t Play Regina in Rebooted Season 7", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Once Upon a Time' Star Lana Parrilla Won't Play Regina in Rebooted Season 7 - TheWrap", "description": "TCA 2017: \"I'm still discovering her,\" actress says about her character", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/once-upon-a-time-lana-parrilla-regina-season-7/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/145970_1679-900x0.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "published_time": "2017-08-06T22:07:15+00:00"}, "author": "Ryan Gajewski", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Ryan Gajewski", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "\u2018Once Upon a Time\u2019 Star Lana Parrilla Won\u2019t Play Regina in Rebooted Season 7", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/once-upon-a-time-lana-parrilla-regina-season-7/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-08-06T15:07:15-07:00", "parsely-section": "news", "parsely-author": "Ryan Gajewski", "parsely-tags": "abc, lana-parrilla, once_upon_a_time, tca-2017", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502057235.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
