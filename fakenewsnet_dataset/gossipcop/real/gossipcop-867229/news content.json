And it seems the boys are excited about welcoming a new sibling too.\n\n\u201cLincoln really just asked if I could open my belly so he could see the baby,\u201d Lowry tweeted in May.\n\nThe star, who graduated college in May, admitted earlier this year that she was nervous bout her third journey to motherhood.\n\n\u201cThis is the baby I thought I wasn\u2019t sure if I could have. I know this isn\u2019t an ideal situation but I know everything will be okay,\u201d she wrote in the February blog post. \u201cAnd like I say in my book \u2014 with a little bit of hustle heart, I can and I will survive anything.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cHaving another child is something I am so happy about and I just can\u2019t wait. My boys are so excited, those who love me are so excited, and I hope that everyone can just be happy for me during this time.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Teen Mom 2\u2018s Kailyn Lowry Shows Off Growing Baby Bump on Beach Vacation with Sons\n\nAlthough the baby\u2019s sex was unknown in the weeks leading up to the birth, Lowry revealed her wishes in a May 11 tweet, writing, \u201cI bought baby bows today \u2026 JUSTTTTT in case we have a girl.\u201d\n\nTeen Mom 2 airs Mondays (9 p.m. ET) on MTV.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/JIBdzNNtiH6B8LYheoB1qIhhCck=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(599x389:601x391)/sister-wives-brown-family-120822-7c5e65afe14546b2bc90f60e3936eb6e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/igFMeS5mCpx2YB9AJEmocXdZidU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(539x0:541x2)/kail-lowry-fathers-day-062023-1-5e8f80b079774b8b88aebdd33ad174d4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0GiQWle5j-7HBl4WdnCfhiq3rdQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(779x674:781x676)/alyssa-scott-nick-cannon-1-102fdfa521b149b090efb345f876234d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/IButP9DZA-V0H5S3ZD-EHbtzbs8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/lowry-rivera-1-4be9d2caa0484e73b0bb37b19732e41d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/SG-fAn0VJg1CDvGC7ts_AHymu9c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/kailyn-lowry-1-2000-f8a5137ec9724eb6b2d86df60b6dca2d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/x7LgzGebUd-l6KEHwAxFpKmAJEc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(359x0:361x2)/amber-heard-baby-juicing-d00edf2047a945c087d39da29c1f9d83.jpeg", "https://people.com/thmb/oyBe5QBDmWQ-LW0U9bFyn3RerZ0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x229:736x231)/kailyn-lowry-kids-back-to-school-090622-cd1c5cdeaeba499281da34472a036ba4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Z8GuT_sikzCB0naRPBv3IOBKXwY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kailyn-lowry-son-isaac-tout-050223-827a8ea528c44ea781c1e76fda6454b1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qSkygZo2BnOTozFmZFDztxMK_7A=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kailyn-lowry-bba65eaeab5e415cbea6c5215c5d60ba.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3P2sGWCFrERCyMdGLJdrm_mvCio=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Chelsea-Houska-and-the-Teen-Mom-2-cast05-9a55da3a0506429fa4dfaa5eda62c233.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/elEQFIY5opEBYcBh2KcQyqGBRWc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(618x447:620x449)/Will-Kopelman-061823-01-ff82fa957837477d994d9ea4d02e3b7a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ECjyBvcK4rbeZ9O2mSOr9vyme-o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(4043x557:4045x559)/david-henrie-600266c6594d4994bb94c12723d3d31b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/vn78Acj9ApcPIxb60NeJmlzbz0Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/witney-carson-051523-1-6b84f16275f94e879d1cb5c4087b89f0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/fVittHrZ6_I6NLnCuEtiONrrG2M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kailyn-lowry-4283115d35c246aa9e67e6461e3cb675.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/5-MperbIa5KvSJd9HKfp3OpxElk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kailyn-lowry-isaac-041123-2-3e3eca5fea274845acb3b94abebedd2e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KBxMRGTw0l0E8_faCYAMC43k4wc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(8028x8799:8030x8801)/kailyn-lowry-8-fe70e17ebc78451089eec858751d0a9f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/o9bR4QzsHKrrEZxT3xA7CFnoj40=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x29:736x31)/nick-cannon-alyssa-baby-123022-1-fb1fbca7c83d4b8fbb3a940c28e9898b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/SG-fAn0VJg1CDvGC7ts_AHymu9c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/kailyn-lowry-1-2000-f8a5137ec9724eb6b2d86df60b6dca2d.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Char Adams", "Char Adams Is A Former Reporter At People.
