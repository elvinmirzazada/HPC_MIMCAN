{"url": "https://ew.com/tv/fall-tv-winners-losers-2017/", "text": "01 of 10 WINNER: THE GOOD DOCTOR Jeff Weddell/ABC The sentimental Monday night sensation is easily the fall's highest-rated new drama, with numbers (14 million viewers; 2.9 demo rating) that are closing in on TV\u2019s long-reigning top docs on Grey\u2019s Anatomy. Plus, watching Freddie Highmore as a gifted surgeon struggling with autism just feels like being hooked up to an IV of warm puppies.\n\n02 of 10 LOSER: MEGYN KELLY TODAY Look at that Megyn Kelly TODAY promo photo. Isn\u2019t this soft and accessible enough for you, America?! Apparently not. Kelly\u2019s ratings keep sliding and are down double digits from the same hour last season. But let\u2019s be honest: For $23 million a year, we\u2019d awkwardly dance with Hoda too.\n\n03 of 10 WINNER: WILL & GRACE Chris Haston/NBC Like some kind of TV industry version of Groundhog Day, the solid success of Will & Grace will ensure at least six more years of networks rebooting old show. Aside from a single preview episode of CBS\u2019 Big Bang Theory prequel, Young Sheldon (whose official launch is Nov. 2), NBC\u2019s Thursday-night reunion is ranking as fall\u2019s No. 1 \u201cnew\u201d comedy.\n\n04 of 10 LOSER: NFL Football Rey Del Rio/Getty Images Viewership has taken a knee amid those national-anthem protests. While the resulting 5-to-8 percent drop might not sound like much, every yard matters when it comes to TV\u2019s massively rated sports franchise.\n\n05 of 10 WINNER: STAR TREK: DISCOVERY Michael Gibson/CBS How many people actually watch the CBS All Access sci-fi series is the biggest mystery in the universe, but it must be enough to earn the revival of the legendary franchise the fall\u2019s second season 2 renewal (Can you remember what the fall\u2019s first early renewal was? \u2026. HBO\u2019s The Deuce. Yeah, we forgot too.)\n\n06 of 10 LOSER: MARVEL'S INHUMANS Karen Neal/ABC A rare Marvel face-plant. ABC\u2019s splashy fantasy about battling royals received an unprecedented rollout in IMAX theaters. Yet also the drama received blistering reviews and even worse ratings on Friday nights (last week's episode was only watched by around 2.3 million viewers). The season\u2019s other new superhero entry, Fox\u2019s X-Men series The Gifted, is doing better, but trending in the wrong direction as well.\n\n07 of 10 WINNER: JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE Randy Holmes/Getty Images After 14 seasons hosting his ABC talk show, late night\u2019s affable Everyman attained newfound relevance and depth by breaking character to reluctantly wade into some of the nation\u2019s biggest political controversies \u2014 most poignantly health-care reform\u2019s potential impact in the wake of his newborn son\u2019s heart surgery.\n\n08 of 10 WINNER: RIVERDALE Bettina Strauss /The CW The acclaimed sleeper drama stunned by doubling its young-adult ratings for its sophomore-season return to rank as the network\u2019s biggest show. Credit The CW for putting season 1 on Netflix so viewers could binge it over the summer, a thrillingly dark season 2 story line, and a snowballing of positive buzz \u2014 such as EW\u2019s recent cover story after Riverdale won our fall bracket contest (that\u2019s right we\u2019re totally taking credit).\n\n09 of 10 LOSER: DYNASTY Bob Mahoney/The CW Better call Netflix! The CW\u2019s sexed-up effort to revive the 1980s soap classic for millennials is practically tied with the network\u2019s other fresh fall offering, the military drama Valor, for broadcast\u2019s lowest-rated new show, with both dipping under a million viewers each for new episodes.", "images":
