In an interview with Allure, Moretz says she had bad cystic acne when she was growing up. Now, she says her skin is acne-free thanks to Accutane and a healthy diet, but she points out that having skin problems \u201cwas a long, hard, emotional process.\u201d\n\nMoretz says she also works to keep her skin gorgeous thanks to an unorthodox facial cleansing method: She washes her face with olive oil. \u201cI swear my skin is so much clearer because of it,\u201d Moretz tells Allure.\n\nIt sounds weird, but Moretz isn\u2019t the only one on the oil-cleansing bandwagon. Pinterest features several pins on olive oil face wash how-tos.\n\nThe American Academy of Dermatology recommends that people look for a cream or ointment that contains olive or jojoba oil to combat dry skin, but makes no mention of actually cleansing with it. But Gary Goldenberg, M.D., medical director of the Dermatology Faculty Practice at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF that there is something to washing your face with olive oil\u2014especially if you have dry skin or eczema. \u201cOlive oil is known to have anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's also a very good moisturizer.\u201d Goldenberg says he has many patients who wash with either olive oil or other natural oils.\n\nFans of oil cleansing\u2014and there are many\u2014say it works by dissolving the oils that are already on your face. Cynthia Bailey, M.D., a diplomat of the American Board of Dermatology and president and CEO of Advanced Skin Care and Dermatology Inc., tells SELF that this is correct. \"Oil will dissolve oily skin residue because like dissolves like,\" she explains. \"If you use moisturizers or makeup that are oil-based, the olive oil will help to remove them.\"\n\nAva Shamban, M.D., a Beverly Hills dermatologist and founder of SKINxFIVE, tells SELF that olive oil is a \"great choice\" of a face wash. \"Using oil will not only remove makeup, but will avoid stripping the skin of natural oils,\" she says. \"Olive oil also has many antioxidants and natural lipids that will replenish lipids that have been lost in sun-damaged, older, or dry skin.\"", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/654d0657899bfa063ef8275a/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/581b853b23409a497ffd3cbc/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/chloe-grace-moretz-oil-cleansing.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/6543f0dc16d1566ed34ff402/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/654e8faf0c5d00b41b737f35/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/65525a9e61e5c641c2539dd8/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/653fcf83e43f6329ccc4a12a/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/581b853b23409a497ffd3cbc/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/chloe-grace-moretz-oil-cleansing.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/653ff7f9673a3159f9e2dd68/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/61f2b0cd898b9838f51324f7/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/653bde406d27c9c0f09e6771/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6553be0f01a01aa26b2abe29/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/654d4cac420e06d131535cbb/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5b881cac9134316166c7782c/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6542c2406277e8152d0dd807/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/581b853b23409a497ffd3cbc/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/chloe-grace-moretz-oil-cleansing.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Korin Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/chloe-grace-moretz-olive-oil-facewash", "title": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz Washes Her Face With Olive Oil, And It's Genius", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Dermatologists say she's on to something.
