{"url": "https://ew.com/tv/the-office-where-are-they-now/", "text": "01 of 18 The Office cast, then and now NBCU/Getty Images When The Office made its midseason debut on NBC on March 24, 2005, it became a sleeper hit for the network and eventually went on to revive its Thursday night comedy lineup. Once famous for the likes of Friends, Will & Grace, and Seinfeld, NBC began a new era of comedy dominance with The Office. Telling the story of the everyday foibles and lives of a group of co-workers at a paper company in Scranton, Pa., this show brought the workplace comedy to new heights and provided a platform to showcase the talents of individuals who have gone on to become some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Steve Carell, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, Mindy Kaling, Ed Helms, and Ellie Kemper. Ahead, find out where they are now.\n\n05 of 18 Rainn Wilson (Dwight Schrute) Justin Lubin/NBCU/Getty Images; Dominik Bindl/WireImage Before The Office, Rainn Wilson was best known for his recurring role as Arthur Martin on Six Feet Under, but he proved himself a new comedic talent as eccentric, brown-nosing office drone Dwight Schrute, earning three Emmy nominations for his performance. Since then, he's brought his unique brand of humor to shows like Adventure Time and Backstrom, and films like Smurfs: The Lost Village (2017). In 2008, he founded the digital media company SoulPancake, and in 2015, he published an autobiography titled The Bassoon King. On TV, he has appeared on Star Trek: Discovery, the Amazon series Utopia, AMC's Dark Winds, and the Roku Channel TV movie Weird: The Al Yankovic Story.\n\n07 of 18 B.J. Novak (Ryan Howard) Paul Drinkwater/NBCU/Getty Images; Karwai Tang/Getty Images B.J. Novak was another cast member to pull double duty as actor and member of the writing staff. He portrayed Ryan Howard, the sleazy office intern who maintained a toxic relationship with Kelly Kapoor. Prior to The Office, Novak was a comedian, perhaps best known for his time as one of Ashton Kutcher's sidekicks on the prank show Punk'd. Novak has continued to act in films like Inglourious Basterds (2009), The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), and Saving Mr. Banks (2013), where he portrayed one of the Sherman brothers. He has also appeared on television shows including The Newsroom and Kaling's The Mindy Project. However, Novak has focused more on writing and business ventures since his time on the show, releasing a collection of short stories titled One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories, launching the now-defunct The List App, creating the Hulu anthology series The Premise, and writing, directing, and starring in the 2022 film Vengeance.\n\n08 of 18 Leslie David Baker (Stanley Hudson) Justin Lubin/NBC/Getty Images; Presley Ann/FilmMagic Formerly a K\u20138 special education teacher, Leslie David Baker had bit roles on several television shows before earning his most memorable part as sarcastic, over-his-job paper salesman Stanley Hudson. While he's still best known for his role on The Office, Baker has lent his voice to the 2017 Captain Underpants film and guest starred on shows including Scorpion and Life in Pieces. He also portrayed Principal Wentworth on Disney Channel's That's So Raven reboot, Raven's Home, and starred in various commercials for Honey Nut Cheerios.\n\n09 of 18 Brian Baumgartner (Kevin Malone) Chris Haston/NBC/Getty Images; Sarah Morris/Getty Images Brian Baumgartner had only scored a few guest-star appearances when he was cast as the dry, not-all-that-bright Kevin Malone on The Office. That remains his most enduring role, but he's also appeared in films like License to Wed (2007) and Four Christmases (2008). He's continued to rack up guest-star credits on TV shows such as Scream Queens, Life in Pieces, Hot in Cleveland, Mike & Molly, and Melissa and Joey. He had a recurring role as Dr. Olonari on Amazon's Hand of God, and has appeared on Disjointed and The Goldbergs. He has hosted multiple podcasts about The Office, including An Oral History of The Office for Spotify and The Office Deep Dive with Brian Baumgartner for iHeart.\n\n10 of 18 Angela Kinsey (Angela Martin) Paul Drinkwater/NBCU/Getty Images; Gregg DeGuire/WireImage Kinsey was best known for a recurring voice role on King of the Hill before being cast as uptight, rule-stickler Angela Martin on The Office. Her scandalous, long-kept secret office romance with Dwight Schrute served as a fun counterpoint to the more tender romance of Jim and Pam. She's continued to excel on television, starring on two seasons of Hulu's Real Housewives spoof The Hotwives and the Netflix series Haters Back Off!. She was a guest star on The Real O'Neals, Life in Pieces, New Girl, Impress Me, and more. She also costarred in the 2019 Netflix film Tall Girl and its 2022 sequel, Tall Girl 2. She cohosts Office Ladies with Fischer and wrote the book Office BFFs with her former costar.\n\n11 of 18 Phyllis Smith (Phyllis Vance) Chris Haston/NBC/Getty Images; Presley Ann/FilmMagic Phyllis Smith was working as a casting associate when offered a role as the soft-spoken Phyllis on The Office. She has since parlayed the role into other memorable parts, including a highly-praised turn as the voice of Sadness in Inside Out. She's appeared on The Middle, Trophy Wife, and in the film Bad Teacher (2011) opposite Cameron Diaz. She also had a recurring role on Netflix's The OA and a small role in Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar (2021).\n\n12 of 18 Kate Flannery (Meredith Palmer) Chris Haston/NBC/Getty Images; JC Olivera/Getty Images Kate Flannery was well-known in the comedy world and as a stage performer before landing the part of the boozy Meredith Palmer. She's since taken on similarly bawdy, gruff, and outlandish characters in guest-starring roles on shows like New Girl, Kevin (Probably) Saves the World, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. She lent her voice talents to the cartoons OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes and Steven Universe and recurred on the TV series All Night. In 2019, she was a contestant on Dancing With the Stars, ultimately placing seventh.\n\n13 of 18 Oscar Nu\u00f1ez (Oscar Martinez) Paul Drinkwater/NBCU/Getty Images; Greg Doherty/Getty Images Oscar Nu\u00f1ez built himself a solid career as a comedian and actor before earning his biggest role yet as Oscar Martinez, an office employee who is frequently the target of casual racism and homophobia. In 2009, he had a memorable turn as a stripper (and various other occupations) named Ramone in The Proposal. Following The Office, he's headlined shows like Benched and People of Earth, as well as guest-starred on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Shameless, and Liv and Maddie. He also played Mr. Hernandez on Netflix's Mr. Iglesias, guested on three episodes of Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist, and had supporting roles in the Sandra Bullock-led film The Lost City (2022) and the Disney+ original Disenchanted (2022).\n\n14 of 18 Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) Justin Lubin/NBC/Getty Images; Leon Bennett/WireImage Creed Bratton played a fictional version of himself on The Office as the resident eccentric, enigmatic oddball. He has played various small roles since becoming an actor in 1979, but prior to the show was likely best known as a member of the folk band the Grass Roots. Since The Office, he's guest-starred on various shows, including Adventure Time, Grace and Frankie, and Franklin & Bash. He also appeared in the well-received indie film Terri (2011), road trip comedy The Guilt Trip (2012), and the Western The Sisters Brothers (2018).\n\n15 of 18 Ed Helms (Andy Bernard) Chris Haston/NBC/Getty Images; Paul Bruinooge/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images Like Carell, Helms was another former Daily Show correspondent who rose to wider fame on The Office, portraying a cappella-obsessed Cornell alum Andy Bernard. Helms hit it big as a mild-mannered dentist who loses a tooth after a wild night in Vegas in 2009's The Hangover. He has also appeared in multiple Hangover sequels and other films like Cedar Rapids (2011) and We're the Millers (2013). Helms has continued to amass a long string of guest-star credits on shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Mindy Project, Angie Tribeca, Arrested Development, and more. He created and starred on the Peacock sitcom Rutherford Falls.\n\n16 of 18 Paul Lieberstein (Toby Flenderson) Mitchell Haaseth/NBC/Getty Images; Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images Paul Lieberstein moonlighted as put-upon HR rep Toby Flenderson, but he was also actually one of the executive producers and writers of the show, even becoming showrunner for seasons 5\u20138. Following The Office, he went on to executive produce the third and final season of The Newsroom, which he appeared on as a train passenger named Richard Westbrook. He also took over as showrunner for Fox's short-lived Ghosted. He guest-starred on an episode of The Mindy Project and had a recurring role on the series People of Earth. In 2018, he wrote and directed his first feature film, Song of Back and Neck, which screened at the Tribeca Film Festival. He went on to write and direct the 2022 Comedy Central TV movie Out of Office.", "images":
