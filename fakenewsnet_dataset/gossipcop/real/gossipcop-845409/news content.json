Not only is Damn on course to land the biggest debut of 2017, it has also received a great deal of praise from fans and critics alike, many of whom are calling the project his best one yet. But none of those kind words can compare to the love and congratulations he received from his mother.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the Compton rapper shared a screenshot of an emoji-laden text his mom, Paula Oliver, had sent him after she listened to Damn for the first time. It\u2019s a lengthy text that is equal parts heartwarming and hilarious, as she shares her initial thoughts on the album as well as the cover art.\n\n\u201cOMG. This cd is bombbbbb!,\u201d she wrote at the beginning of the text. \u201cYou should have put me and your daddy on this one too j/k.\u201d\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know, Kendrick\u2019s mom and dad were featured in the skits on Good Kid, M.A.A.D City. Though they didn\u2019t contribute to Damn, Kendrick does make references to them.\n\nPaula told her son she thought this was the best project he\u2019s released, before addressing the album\u2019s cover.\n\n\u201cYour daddy said u look stressed on the cover lol I said ni**a that s the point,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe always stressing him out. Since a Lil boy you been a over think though \u2026\u2026 But What you say, a ni**a make it look sexy? Boy you can make a dog laugh.\u201d\n\nOliver admitted she missed Kendrick\u2019s Coachella live stream, but heard he was floating in the air. She also showed love to Kendrick's \u201cdie hard\u201d fans a.k.a. KenFolk who showed up to watch his headlining set: \u201cI love them.\u201d\n\nKendrick replied in the way most sons would to the emoji-heavy text: \u201cWho taught you 100? Lol.\"", "images": ["https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/complex/images/r6qzlkykmhbwhztthhnu/kendrick-lamar-mom.jpg?downsize=700%3A%2A&output-quality=auto&output-format=auto",
