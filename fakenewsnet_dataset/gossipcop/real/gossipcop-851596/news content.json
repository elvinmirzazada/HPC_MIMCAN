And on Saturday, the 25-year-old Teen Mom 2 star finally did just that \u2014 walking the stage in her cap and gown to receive her degree from Delaware State University.\n\nThe mother of two \u2014 who is currently pregnant with her third child \u2014 posted a sweet photo of herself and a friend to Instagram, both decked out in their graduation day best.\n\n\u201cGuess what today is!\u201d she wrote, adding a series of emojis (including the graduation cap) and the hashtag \u201c#DSU.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did it!\u201d she added on Twitter \u2014 writing later, \u201cthere\u2019s beauty in the struggle.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Lowry took to her blog to share pictures from her recent graduation photo shoot with her two sons \u2014 and her baby bump!\n\n\u201cBetween teen motherhood, financial hurdles in the beginning, then moving to a new state, marriage, babies and divorce\u2026 and then of course just wanting to give up, I (barely) held on,\u201d she wrote of her struggle to get her degree.\n\n\u201cThis has been an extremely long and emotional road for me and for my family,\u201d she added. \u201cThere are a select few people around me that have helped make this possible for me, they know who they are and I\u2019m so thankful for them. I love you!\u201d\n\nJenn Glasser/https://www.facebook.com/G7Studio/\n\nFor the cap and gown photos, which were captured by her friend, Jenn Glasser, the MTV star wore a simple black dress with matching black sandals, black and white beaded bracelets, and a cream, black and gold statement necklace.\n\nIn college graduation tradition, Lowry personalized her cap with fake, stick-on diamonds and gold sticker letters that read, \u201cmom X3 + a degree.\u201d\n\nShe presumably wore that cap on Saturday \u2014 though her Instagram post didn\u2019t show it.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Former Bachelorette Ali Fedotowsky Opens Up About Her Biggest Parenting Mishap\n\nLowry\u2019s two little boys \u2014 Isaac Elliot, 7 (whom she shares with ex-boyfriend Joe Rivera) and son Lincoln Marshall, 3 (whom she shares with ex-husband Javi Marroquin) \u2014 cheered mom on in the pics and on Saturday.\n\nThe MTV star revealed in a blog post in February that she is pregnant with her third child \u2014 confirming on May 2 that the baby\u2019s father is her friend Chris Lopez.\n\nFans began to suspect that Lopez was the father after Lowry uploaded a photo of herself cradling her baby bump on April 26 with the caption: \u201cHappy bump day from Baby Lo & me.\u201d\n\nWhile the baby\u2019s father has been confirmed, the sex of the baby appears to be even unknown for Lowry. She tweeted on Thursday, \u201cI bought baby bows today\u2026 JUSTTTTT in case we have a girl.\u201d\n\nIn February, Lowry admitted that she was trepidatious about the pregnancy initially.\n\n\u201cThis is the baby I thought I wasn\u2019t sure if I could have. I know this isn\u2019t an ideal situation but I know everything will be okay,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd like I say in my book \u2014 with a little bit of hustle and heart, I can and I will survive anything. Having another child is something I am so happy about and I just can\u2019t wait. My boys are so excited, those who love me are so excited, and I hope that everyone can just be happy for me during this time.\u201d", "images":
