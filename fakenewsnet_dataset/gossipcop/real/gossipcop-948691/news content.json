You don\u2019t just move on from Jackie Burkhart. I\u2019m like the bottle. You need a 12-step program to break my spell.\u201d Understandably, Mila tackling the lines all these years later had her cracking up in no time.\n\nThe first one that had her in stitches goes: \u201cHere\u2019s what I don\u2019t get -- why would Sally sell seashells down by the seashore. I mean, that\u2019s a terrible location for a seashell stand.\u201d She loved it so much, she struggled to even say it!\n\nAnd another line appears to have taken on a new meaning for the mother of two in the years since starring on the Fox show. \u201cI\u2019m not strong, but I know a lot of ways to destroy a man emotionally.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think my husband can concur,\u201d she responded with a giggle.\n\nIn her interview with the magazine, Mila also addressed the regular divorce and pregnancy rumors she faces from the media.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t read anything about myself,\" she admitted. \"I genuinely don\u2019t know what\u2019s written about me...other than I know that I\u2019m pregnant about once a year and my husband and I are getting a divorce once a year. I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I\u2019m like, Oh, boy, OK!\"\n\nSee more on Mila in the clip below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fmila_kunis_getty868476658.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/mila_kunis_getty868476658.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-05%2Fmila_kunis_ashton_kutcher_tid_exclusive_mila_171547.jpg%3Fh%3D5133596c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-05%2F1280_mila_kristen_michael.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-07%2Fmila_kunis_cosmo_.jpg%3Fh%3De67185e4&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2013-10/breaking_bad_640.jpg?width=640"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/mila_kunis_getty868476658.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/mila-kunis-reads-her-own-hilarious-lines-from-that-70s-show-watch-105369", "title": "Mila Kunis Reads Her Own Hilarious Lines From 'That '70s Show': Watch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/mila_kunis_getty868476658.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The actress once again tackles the unforgettable Jackie Burkhart.", "title": "Mila Kunis Reads Her Own Hilarious Lines From 'That '70s Show': Watch", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/mila-kunis-reads-her-own-hilarious-lines-from-that-70s-show-watch-105369", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The actress once again tackles the unforgettable Jackie Burkhart.", "twitter": {"description": "The actress once again tackles the unforgettable Jackie Burkhart.", "title": "Mila Kunis Reads Her Own Hilarious Lines From 'That '70s Show': Watch", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/mila-kunis-reads-her-own-hilarious-lines-from-that-70s-show-watch-105369", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/mila_kunis_getty868476658.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Mila Kunis Reads Her Own Hilarious Lines From 'That '70s Show': Watch | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, News, TV, Mila Kunis", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
