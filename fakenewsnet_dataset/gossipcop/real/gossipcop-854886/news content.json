In it, she has to give Farrell\u2019s character a sponge bath, which Kidman admitted, \u201ctook about a day\u201d to film.\n\nWhen Norton asked if filming the sponge bath scenes were awkward, she referred to another upcoming movie she co-stars with Farrell, called The Killing Of A Sacred Deer.\n\n\u201cConsidering what Colin and I did in \u2018The Killing Of A Sacred Deer\u2019, that was nothing,\u201d she told Norton. They play husband and wife that are described as a troubled couple, but their \u201csex life is good, if a little kinky,\u201d according to Variety.\n\nBut, according to E! News, she quickly said, \u201cCan we move on? My husband is on the show!\u201c\n\nWe don\u2019t blame her for wanting the change the subject so fast! Norton switched gears by asking Kidman about her upcoming birthday, in which she turns 50! Urban talks about what he has planned and what he did for her 40th in the clip below.", "images": ["https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/themes/countryrebel/img/cr-logo-hrzl.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%2081'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Miley_and_Dolly_Header-1-450x263.jpg", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/themes/countryrebel/img/cr_logo.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20110%2074'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20263'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/blakemomchristmassong-450x263.jpg", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pp-logo-bluestone-1.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1642875949273548&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20106%2071'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pp-logo-sor-1.png", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dolly-sister-defends-450x263.png", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pp-logo-crtv-1.png", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/themes/countryrebel/img/cr-circular-logo.png", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Christmas-list-header-450x263.jpg", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jason-Aldean-Header-Image-450x263.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2089%2060'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201240%201240'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pp-logo-www-1.png", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/keith-nic.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201274%20704'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20126%2085'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20260%2050'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/3masters3-YouTube-450x263.jpg", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pp-logo-cmn-1-2.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20108%2073'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Brett-Eldredge-Header-450x263.png"], "top_img": "https://countryrebel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/keith-nic.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://countryrebel.com/blogs/videos/interview-gets-awkward-when-nicole-kidman-is-asked-about-another-man-in-front-of-keith-urban/", "title": "Interview Gets Awkward When Nicole Kidman Is Asked About Another Man In Front Of Keith Urban", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Things got a little awkward when married couple Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban stopped by the UK talk show The Graham Norton Show on Friday (May 19).
