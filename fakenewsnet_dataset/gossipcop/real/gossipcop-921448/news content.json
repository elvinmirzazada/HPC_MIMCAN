And then John Mulaney had to go and ruin everything.\n\nHader is known for never being able to keep it together while playing this particular character, but while appearing on \u201cLate Night with Seth Meyers\u201d Monday, the late-night sketch show alum explained he almost got through it until Mulaney showed up as Stefon\u2019s lawyer (and \u201cconceptual piss artist\u201d)\n\n\u201cHe whispered in my ear to make me laugh,\u201d Hader told Seth Meyers, laughing even then. \u201cHe said, \u2018My girlfriend works at Yoshinoya Beef Bowl,\u2019 which is a restaurant chain in L.A. What?!\u201d\n\nAnd that is what took Hader down.\n\nWatch the clip above.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/dwts-s32-semifinals.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lessons-in-Chemistry-Harriet-Aja.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/the-masked-singer-cow.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/snl-saturday-night-live-weekend-update-bill-hader-stefon-returns.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Thomas-Augsberger.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/snl-saturday-night-live-weekend-update-bill-hader-stefon-returns.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas", "Ross A.
