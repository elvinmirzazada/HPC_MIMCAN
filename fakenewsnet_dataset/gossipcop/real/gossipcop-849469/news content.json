His hand fell between Burgess\u2019 thighs before she quickly and discreetly relocated it.\n\nSpeaking to Entertainment Tonight, Bolton swore the \u201chand placement that went south, so to speak\u201d was \u201ctotally unintentional.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just stargazed by Nick and Peta\u2019s performance and I was looking at the TV screen,\u201d Bolton explained. \u201cI felt her bump into me yet I wasn\u2019t really looking at what was bumping into me.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to PEOPLE after Monday\u2019s season premiere, the hot pair didn\u2019t deny that sparks were flying.\n\n\u201cI was telling her before we started tonight, \u2018I can\u2019t look at you for too long. I might get distracted. That\u2019s why I might miss some of my steps,\u2019 \u201d Bolton said. \u201cShe\u2019s obviously beautiful.\u201d\n\nBurgess explained that the competition was her focus.\n\n\u201cOh gosh,\u201d the 31-year-old dancer told reporters. \u201cI am a professional. Look, we have a lot of chemistry and we have a lot of fun, but first and foremost we are trying to do a really great job in this competition. I want Bonner to be around until the end and I want to take this man to the finale. That is our priority. Everyone is making a lot of our really obvious chemistry.\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Most Expensive TV Shows of All Time\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the first to say that she is as 100 percent a professional as she is beautiful,\u201d echoed Bonner, who previously told PEOPLE it was adoration at first sight for him. \u201cShe\u2019s a great teacher. She\u2019s pushing me hard I\u2019m working hard. I just want to make her proud.\u201d\n\nDancing with the Stars airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC.", "images":
