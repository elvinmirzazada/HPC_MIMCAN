Check out my stories to see a closer look \ud83d\udc9b @kyliecosmetics,\u201d she wrote in the caption.\n\nOn her Instagram stories, Jenner revealed that her latest collection grew as her then unborn baby did.\n\n\u201cSo, before I open my newest collection I just wanted to tell you guys a little bit of the background,\u201d she said. \u201cI worked on this pretty much my entire pregnancy. And right after we chose Stormi\u2019s name, her name really inspired me.\u201d\n\nIn a second Instagram post, the TV reality star showed off an up-close look at the items she loved most, writing, \u201ca few of my favorites \ud83d\udc9b #WeatherCollection launching Feb.28th inspired by my Stormi. @kyliecosmetics.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BfhJM3SloCj/?taken-by=kyliejenner\n\nShe continued, \u201cSo, I spent a lot of time on this collection and I put a lot of detail into it, so I\u2019ll do my best to show you guys all the fun details.\u201d\n\nJenner introduced three new matte lipsticks in a pitch black color called Nightfall, a beige called Cosmic and a peachy nude called Nova. The lipsticks themselves are decorated with lightning bolts in tune with the stormy weather theme.\n\nKylie Jenner/Instagram\n\nKylie Jenner/Instagram\n\nThe collection comes with two eye palettes, the first of which is called Calm Before the Storm. The palette is complete with 10 shades that come in both matte and metallic pastel shades in a white box that is bright yellow on the inside.\n\nThe second palette, Eye of the Storm, comes in a navy blue box with lightning strikes decorating the outside. The colors come in deeper shades from a bright yellow, to navy blue to a metallic emerald hue.\n\nThe Keeping Up with the Kardashians star gave her followers an update on how her daughter was faring on Twitter Wednesday after a fan asked her how Stormi was doing.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s good,\u201d Jenner tweeted. \u201cShe looks just like me when I was a baby.\u201d\n\nThe new mom said she was also still in complete awe of her daughter, telling the fan she is \u201cstill staring at her all day.\u201d\n\nThe mother of one\u2019s tweet is the first comment about her daughter since Jenner announced Stormi\u2019s arrival in a statement on Twitter and Instagram Feb. 4, as well as a video, titled \u201cTo Our Daughter\u201d on YouTube, three days after she gave birth on Feb. 1.\n\nJenner\u2019s tweet also comes two days after Travis Scott, her boyfriend and father of her child, was asked about his newborn by photographers in Los Angeles on Monday.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d the 25-year-old rapper says simply before climbing into a black SUV.\n\nNews that Jenner and Scott were expecting a baby was first confirmed by PEOPLE in September. The new parents have been dating since April 2017.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kylie Jenner Unveils Her Daughter\u2019s Full Name \u2014 Whose Last Name Did Stormi Take?\n\n\u201cDespite being new parents, Kylie and Travis are still in a new relationship too. Kylie is happy with their living situation,\u201d a source close to the Kylie Cosmetics mogul recently told PEOPLE. \u201cTravis is a great dad. When he wants to work, Kylie is supportive.\u201d\n\nAdding, \u201cFor being so young, she is very chilled out about her relationship with Travis. She isn\u2019t making any huge plans for the future.\u201d", "images":
