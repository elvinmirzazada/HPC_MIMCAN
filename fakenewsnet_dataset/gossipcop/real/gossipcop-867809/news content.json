Have you ever noticed that these ladies have the best vacation homes? First, we couldn't stop drooling over RHONY alum Jill Zarin's recently renovated Boca Raton pad. And as we know, Dorinda Medley always makes her Berkshires home nice. And now, Ramona Singer is inviting us into her newly-renovated Hamptons home with photos that make us yearn for a tranquil, all-white retreat of our own. But if we can't get a second home at the moment, at least we can take a few decorating tips from the Ageless by Ramona skincare mogul. (RHONY airs Wednesdays at 9/8c.)\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of New York City on Peacock and catch up on the Bravo app.\n\nRamona recently stopped by Bravo HQ to tell us where she shopped for the goods she used to renonvate her stunning home. We'll fill you in on that. But first, take a peek inside:\n\nCan you blame us for wanting to know how to crib that look? In her caption, Ramona gave a shout-out to AllModern, which sells modern (natch) home goods in categories ranging from outdoor furniture to bedding and bathroom accessories.

I ripped out all my floors in the house, I took out all my furniture and gave it all away to my housekeeper, yard men, and ... all the people that work for me,\" she shared. \"And I just ordered a bunch of things, whether it was online, from AllModern, or Wayfair, some things from Restoration Hardware.\"\n\nAnd don't forget: Ramona has a good friend in the interior-design biz. \"I bought some Jill Zarin rugs, which are gorgeous and not that expensive,\" she shared.\n\nWell, now we're totally inspired to renovate our own place. Hmm, maybe we'll just start with a few tweaks to the kitchen ...", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/heather-gay-lisa-barlow.jpg?itok=dF7ippmY", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/09/katie-maloney.jpg?itok=-aILWmYU", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/rhop-workout-gear.jpg?itok=wZZ52Am7", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_1310x530/public/2023/05/rhony_s14-web-dynamiclead-desktop-1920x1080.png?itok=C0Q96KSu", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/lindsay-hubbard_0.jpg?itok=3i76Ck9O", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/wwhl-shotski-01.jpg?itok=EGfkCqFB", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/rhonj-thanksgiving-plans.jpg?itok=IwmXVwhp", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/_bravocon_2023_bringing_the_miami_heat_to_vegas-1.jpg?itok=m16EAVYr", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/07/most-wanted-ramona-renovation.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/Erika-Jayne.jpg?itok=UlkUohwJ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/margaret_josephs.jpg?itok=2-qcQ1gh", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/865/635/180406_3696960_Ramona_Singer_Shares_Details_on_Her_New_Skin.jpg?itok=TUpVGSS_", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/04/alexia-nepola-frankie-rosello-wwhl.jpg?itok=PvjMMiiN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/07/robyn-dixon-skincare-business.jpg?itok=HYmaLIBv", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/10/winter-house-logo.jpg?itok=HgdPm7E5", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/730/950/RHONY_1416_Preview_1.jpg?itok=tNDV7JTk", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/themes/custom/reality/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/Erika-Jayne.jpg?itok=Y2WJV_vf", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/winter_house_tom_schwatrz_katie_flood.jpg?itok=wflW9cr2", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/729/475/RHONY_1416_Preview_2.jpg?itok=HNo-nSVI", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/candiace-dillard-dorothy-watts_0.jpg?itok=IKGFE_Tu", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/934/54/RHONY_1416_First_Look.jpg?itok=pXrPJ4r_"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/07/most-wanted-ramona-renovation.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city/most-wanted/ramona-singer-revealed-where-she-bought-the-decor", "title": "See RHONY's Ramona Singer Hamptons Home Renovation, Decor", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1138730, "parsely-section": "Style & Living Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"How Ramona Singer Decorated Her Gorgeous Hamptons Home\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"Style & Living\"},\"field_tv_shows\":\"The Real Housewives of New York City\",\"field_microsite\":\"Style & Living\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1156285\",\"site_section\":\"Style & Living\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/07\\/most-wanted-ramona-renovation.jpg?itok=LrfMm1kJ\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/07\\/most-wanted-ramona-renovation.jpg?itok=rvq_G9rZ\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/07\\/most-wanted-ramona-renovation.jpg?itok=V0Q8ALyT\",\"70x70\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/fp_scale_crop_70x70\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/07\\/most-wanted-ramona-renovation.jpg?itok=2ow1LU5V\"}}", "description": "There must something in the water with The Real Housewives of New York City.
