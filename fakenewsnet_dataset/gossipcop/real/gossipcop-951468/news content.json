Every time it\u2019s time for her to escape she is always flipping fiddling around,\u201d one said.\n\n\u201cSince she wants to stay and be captain save a hoe, June better burn gilead to the ground because I\u2019m not gonna wait another season for her to be toying with Waterford,\u201d another viewer added. \u201cCan you imagine June\u2019s Martha when she see Offred show up at the house in season 3,\u201d one fan tweeted, along with a GIF of comedian Kevin Hart looking ticked off.\n\n\u201cJune, girl, you gonna be running out of options of people willing to get your ass outta Gilead. Literally sacrificing their life for yours,\u201d another said, pointing out this is not the first time June has walked away from escaping.\n\nBut not everyone was irritated with Moss\u2019 character to giving up yet another chance at freedom, with one writing: I\u2019m pissed that I have to wait a year to find out what happens next, I\u2019m pissed b/c June surprised me, I\u2019m pissed at the writers for doing such a damn good job w/ the finale & I\u2019m pissed at myself b/c I understand June\u2019s decision!\u201d\n\n\u201cJune stayed for Hanna [sic], to keep fighting. #Solidarity,\u201d another supporter tweeted.\n\nOK, fine, maybe it was heroic or whatever.\n\nSee some of the best reactions to June\u2019s choice below and read our interview with creator/showrunner Bruce Miller about the Season 2 finale here.\n\nJune, girl, you gonna be running out of options of people willing to get your ass outta Gilead.
