{"url": "https://ew.com/tv/fall-tv-winners-losers-2018/", "text": "01 of 11 Loser: The Walking Dead (AMC) AMC The former mega-hit\u2019s ratings have dropped to about 5 million a week for season 9 and an all-time low in the adult demo. AMC\u2019s ads blaring that star Andrew Lincoln will be the next beloved cast member to leave probably aren\u2019t helping. A TV show isn\u2019t like a zombie \u2014 you can only cut off so many limbs and expect it to keep going.\n\n02 of 11 Winner: Manifest (NBC) David Giesbrecht/NBC It\u2019s been 14 years since ABC\u2019s Lost, yet NBC is averaging 11 million viewers for another ensemble mystery-thriller about a group of airline passengers. Manifest stars primetime cornea candy Josh Dallas and is tying Grey\u2019s Anatomy as the second highest-rated drama on broadcast this fall (and doesn\u2019t even have a smoke monster).\n\n03 of 11 Winner: The Haunting of Hill House (Netflix) Steve Dietl/Netflix Maybe TV critics are the only people watching this show \u2014 who can tell, with Netflix\u2019s refusal to release their secret viewership numbers that might give us ammo to beat up on Iron Fist? But the horror series loosely based on Shirley Jackson\u2019s classic novel is generating strong reviews (averaging 80 percent on Metacritic) and plenty of buzz, including a news report claiming subscribers are literally vomiting in terror. So that\u2019s a win in our books.\n\n04 of 11 Loser: Reboots Dean Buscher/The CW Viewers have griped about the reboot trend for years. Networks might be forced to agree now that three high-profile familiar titles had surprisingly soft launches: CBS' youthful recasting of Magnum P.I., a revival of Murphy Brown that brought the original cast back after a 20-year hiatus, and (to a less-disappointing degree) The CW\u2019s modernday remix of Charmed. So perhaps Sliders: 2020 might not happen after all?\n\n05 of 11 Winner: Last Man Standing (Fox) Randy Holmes/ABC via Getty Images There\u2019s nothing quite like getting publicly dumped only to rebound with a far better relationship. Tim Allen\u2019s sitcom is getting its best ratings in years on Fridays (averaging 8 million viewers) and easily ranking as the night\u2019s top show \u2014 why, in the adult demo it\u2019s averaging only a tenth of a point behind ABC\u2019s Modern Family.\n\n06 of 11 Loser: The Alec Baldwin Show (ABC) ABC Only one episode has aired so far, so things could still improve, but the actor\u2019s talk show tripped spectacularly out of the gate. Not only was it the lowest-rated show on Sunday for its premiere, the program had the smallest audience (2.1 million viewers) across all major network shows so far this fall (tying something called Child Support that we\u2019re not even sure is a real thing).\n\n07 of 11 Winner: New Amsterdam (NBC) Francisco Roman/NBC The aspirational drama about a medical director (Ryan Eggold) turning a hospital into what everybody wishes hospitals were like is a surprising breakout success considering it received modest reviews. It\u2019s a little sad, though, that NBC can get nearly 10 million viewers a week by simply depicting a vision of American health care where patients are treated with kindness and respect.\n\n08 of 11 Loser: Lethal Weapon (Fox) Ray Mickshaw/FOX A mess. When this L.A. detective drama first launched two years ago it kinda hit. Then star Clayne Crawford was dumped in May due to alleged on-set misbehavior. Then Seann William Scott was hired to replace Crawford. Now Damon Wayans has declared he\u2019s quitting, leaving Stifler stiffed. The show might get canceled after its 15 episodes air this season. We\u2019re pretty sure this photo isn\u2019t a publicity shot but is actually what it\u2019s like on set right now.\n\n09 of 11 Winner & Loser: The Conners (ABC) Robert Trachtenberg/ABC Such a weird ratings story: The Conners premiere did a great number (10.4 million viewers) that looked small due to inevitable comparisons with last spring\u2019s blockbuster return of Roseanne. Was this the first episode of a new show? Or the series finale of an old show? Both? What that means moving forward is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\n10 of 11 Winner: NFL Football NFL Films/HBO Reports of the sport\u2019s demise amid the whole kneeling debate have been premature. NBC\u2019s Sunday Night Football has been averaging 20.2 million viewers \u2014 its best season opening since its record 2015 season. Across all networks, NFL viewership is up 2 percent for the season. Sure, that's not much, but these days the thing that goes Up goes in the Win column.", "images":
