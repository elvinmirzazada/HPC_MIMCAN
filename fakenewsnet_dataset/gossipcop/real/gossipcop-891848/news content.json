Season three will start off with a \"clean slate.\" That's what the Duffer brothers, the creators behind the show, told The Hollywood Reporter. Remember, the Upside Down has been closed, so that danger isn't looming over the characters anymore. But there's the issue of that pesky Mind Flayer hovering over the school, which is certainly going to cause some trouble. Ross Duffer told THR, \"They've shut the door on the Mind Flayer, but not only is it still there in the Upside Down, it's very much aware of the kids, and particularly Eleven.\"\n\n3. Expect to see more of Erica, Lucas's iconic little sister. \u201cIt\u2019s cool because she\u2019s more than just Lucas\u2019s sister: She\u2019s her own character,\" Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas), tells Glamour. \"Erica has so much flavor and personality. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\n4. Max and Eleven start to bond. \"We\u2019ve only ever really seen boy power [on the show], which is so important to have those boys [and their friendship]. We can\u2019t degrade those boys. They\u2019re so amazing...but this season we need to see the girls onscreen,\" Millie Bobby Brown, who plays Eleven, tells Glamour. \"It was so important for Stranger Things to embody that girl power and what other way than to have Max and Eleven, the most two powerful forces, come together? It was so important.\u201d\n\nSadie Sink, who plays Max, adds, \u201cI love that you get to see two girls who are both powerful in their own way get along so well. At the end of season two, I wasn\u2019t really happy where they left Max and Eleven\u2019s relationship. I thought it was going to go in the direction of pitting them against each other and having a weird rivalry or something. It was nice not to have girls that are fighting. I\u2019m just glad that they\u2019re able to kind of guide each other and be role models to each other in their own different ways.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/5c9246c25387ab2cecaffbe9/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/ST3%2520Production%2520Still%25202.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d1bcb177d856300082ac436/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ST3-Production-Still-4.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d1bca1b7d856300082ac434/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/M59_promo_stills_022519.0018_R.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/64cd37f7f2d4984422dd4ba1/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5c92447036667e33085e97c3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ST3_KA_Digital_Debut_PRE_UK.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d1b8529c52e4e0008685d7f/1:1/pass/GettyImages-1159623257.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5c9246c25387ab2cecaffbe9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ST3%20Production%20Still%202.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d1b8fc40e914e00086b1e47/1:1/pass/GettyImages-1153141404.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5d1ac82d2f3b7b000872ecc1/1:1/pass/151635_0092.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_800%2Cq_80%2Cw_800/v1561394087/glamour_6-things-people-who-use-plan-b-are-sick-of-hearing.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6564d2808e843e41a3d82eeb/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/65159927af8cae32202cbfc6/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5c9246c25387ab2cecaffbe9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ST3%2520Production%2520Still%25202.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5c9246c25387ab2cecaffbe9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ST3%20Production%20Still%202.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christopher Rosa", "Jessica Radloff", "August"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/stranger-things-season-3-details", "title": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Season 3: Everything We Know So Far", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Netflix announced on Friday, December 1, that season three of \"Stranger Things\" is officially happening.
