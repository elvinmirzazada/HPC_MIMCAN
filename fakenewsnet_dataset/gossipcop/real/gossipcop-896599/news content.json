We are blessed beyond measure. We have everything we need,\u201d the message read. Included in the message was a photo of Psalm, bundled up in blankets while lying in a see-through acrylic crib.\n\nThe reality star previously opened up to Architectural Digest about her now-16-month-old daughter Chicago\u2018s nursery, including the unique crib she has seen a lot of use out of already with son Saint, 3 and daughter North, 6 next month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty much using the same crib and everything that I had for our other kids,\u201d said Kardashian West said at the time. \u201cWe have a Vetro Lucite crib and we have a Roy\u00e8re bed in there and a really fluffy cream rug.\u201d\n\nBeyhive members may recognize the $4,200 crib as the same one the 37-year-old singer and husband JAY-Z purchased for their daughter Blue Ivy.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

a changing table made for baby Chicago, whose nursery decor fits right in with the rest of their home\u2019s aesthetic of \u201clight colors and woods and soft and natural colors.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s one other (comfortable and practical) piece of nursery furniture the new mom of three cherishes greatly: her glider.\n\n\u201cI have a glider with an ottoman for feeding,\u201d she told Architectural Digest. \u201cWith the first baby, I had a rocking chair, and I just love a glider so much more \u2014 you can move easier.\u201d", "images":
