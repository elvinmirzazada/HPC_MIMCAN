That\u2019s why you\u2019re a f\u2014ing piece of s\u2014 father!\u201d\n\nUpon hearing Pumpkin\u2019s criticisms, Sugar Bear rips his shirt out of anger: \u201cC\u2019mon then!\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Real Cost of Going to Coachella\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon bitch! I swear to God I will beat your f\u2014ing ass!\u201d Pumpkin yells as she is pulled away from the scene. After kicking a box, Sugar Bear is directed to cool off and \u201ctake a break.\u201d\n\nWorried about her youngest daughter\u2019s whereabouts, Mama June presses crew to know where Honey Boo Boo is.\n\n\u201cWhere in the f\u2014 is Alana?\u201d she questions. Thankfully, Honey Boo Boo is \u201cnot even near\u201d the argument and is \u201caway away\u201d and safe.\n\nVisibly shaken by the blowup, Pumpkin cries in the arms of the bodyguard, who attempts to comfort her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says as he holds her close.\n\nMama June: The Confrontation airs Friday (9 p.m. ET) on WE tv.", "images":
