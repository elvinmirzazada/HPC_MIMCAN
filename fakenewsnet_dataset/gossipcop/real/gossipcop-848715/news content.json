Jennifer Lawrence has changed up her hair yet again and added bangs!\n\nThe 26-year-old was recently spotted rocking some chic, blunt bangs on the set of her upcoming film \"Red Sparrow.\"\n\nFlynet Pictures via Splash News It's been quite some time since we've seen Lawrence rock bangs.\n\nWhile the new 'do is likely for her role as a Russian spy in the film, we aren't sure if it's wig or an actual chop. She looks so fabulous that we're hoping this fringe is here to stay.\n\nClosed Captioning ON OFF apply | reset x Text Display\n\nBackground\n\nEnhancements font\n\nTimes New Roman Arial Comic Sans\n\nT T T T size\n\n\n\ncolor share link Do Jennifer Lawrence and Helen Mirren look alike?

From bobs to pixies to even different types of bangs, she's tried it all.\n\nWhile the actress has been a blonde for most of her career, in May 2016, she stepped out with platinum locks that created instant summer hair color inspiration.\n\nJeff Spicer / Getty Images This ultra icy hue was a first for Lawrence.\n\nThis flirty bob looks inspired by flapper girls in the '20s.\n\nStuart C. Wilson / Getty Images Lawrence opted for a bob as she grew out her pixie.\n\nThis haircut was the result of her grown-out pixie \u2014 but the slicked-back style really works for her.\n\nJason Merritt / Getty Images Lawrence slicked back her growing pixie for the Oscars in 2014.\n\nShe made the chop into a pixie in 2013 after explaining that her hair was fried from being overprocessed.\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images Lawrence showed off her bold pixie in 2013.\n\nMonths before making the big cut, Lawrence had cascading, light brown tresses, which made it even more shocking when she went for such a drastic and dramatic look.\n\nFrederick M. Brown / Getty Images Months before chopping her hair into a pixie, Lawrence had long, glamorous tresses.\n\nBut that wasn't the darkest hair color she's had. In 2012, she had chestnut brown locks and a completely different look.\n\nJason Merritt / Getty Images It's hard to even recognize Lawrence with these super dark locks.\n\nAnd then there was the period in 2012 when she had blunt bangs and strawberry blond hair.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris / Getty Images This isn't the first time Lawrence has tried bangs, as seen here at a screening of \"The Hunger Games\" in 2012.\n\nBefore that, in 2010 when her career was just beginning to kick off, she really looked like the girl next door with these soft curls.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris / WireImage This is the curliest we've seen Lawrence's hair.\n\nShort or long, dark or blonde, bangs or no bangs, it seems like Lawrence can rock any hairstyle.\n\nWhat will she try next?\n\nSlideshow Photos Getty Images See Jennifer Lawrence's red carpet evolution See Jennifer Lawrence's red carpet evolution of 2007 Movieguide Faith and Values Awards In one of her earliest red carpet appearances, JLaw rocks a funky short dress with a hint of tulle.
