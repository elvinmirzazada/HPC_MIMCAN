My husband wants children with me and we are working on it,\" the 46-year-old revealed to E!\n\nShe also said that she was getting her hopes high to have a kid within the year, making pregnancy rumors even more heightened. But, during her interview at the \"Wendy Williams Show,\" she neither confirmed nor denied if she was indeed pregnant.\n\n\"I am not saying either way, but when I am ready to say, I will tell the world,\" Moore explained, leaving fans clueless on whether a baby is on the way or not. It can be remembered that photos of her surfaced as she was just leaving the Barbados Fertility Centre, where she was believed to be getting an IVF treatment.\n\nWith her vague statement, it seems that the reality star is nowhere near spilling details on her journey towards motherhood. This could be expected as this was the case with her husband, businessman Marc Daly. Moore had kept Daly's identity from her co-stars, and even their summer wedding in Sta. Lucia was kept a secret.\n\nShe had also been able to keep his identity under wraps from the show, which garnered ire from some of her costars. Kim Zolciak even claimed that Daly was nonexistent during an argument with Moore.\n\nPorsha Williams also found it unfair for Moore to keep the relationship a secret when most of the cast's lives were aired on the show. Despite this, Moore revealed that she was just trying to protect the relationship from heading into a divorce as Daly was a \"private person.\"\n\n\"RHOA\" airs every Sunday, at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.", "images": ["https://christiantoday.com/assets/img/brands/christian-post.svg", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/thumb/82664/mental-health.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://christiantoday.com/assets/img/brands/vide-press.svg", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/thumb/81920/thanksgiving.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/full/81316/vineyard-anaheim-the-dwelling-place.png?w=121&h=68&l=37&t=19", "https://christiantoday.com/assets/img/brands/edifi.svg", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/full/81920/thanksgiving.jpg?w=121&h=68&l=50&t=40", "https://christiantoday.com/assets/img/brands/crossmap.svg", "https://christiantoday.com/assets/img/brands/gnl.svg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/assets/img/logo-footer.png", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/full/19402/kenya-moore.png", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/full/82740/barbados.jpg?w=121&h=68&l=35&t=42", "https://christiantoday.com/assets/img/brands/breathe-cast.jpg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/assets/img/logo.svg", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/full/19402/kenya-moore.png?p=120741&w=760&l=50&t=40", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/thumb/82713/pam-sydenham.png?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/full/82146/aaron-edwards.jpg?w=121&h=68&l=50&t=40", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/full/50555/andy-croft.jpg?w=121&h=68&l=50&t=40", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31iz6hfFutd16.gif?labels=Domain.christiantoday_com,DomainId.120718", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/full/82741/hans-schmidt.png?w=121&h=68&l=50&t=40", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/thumb/82718/newfoundland.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://christiantoday.com/assets/img/brands/bible-portal.svg", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/thumb/82736/journey-to-bethlehem.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40", "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/thumb/81818/death.jpg?w=82&h=59&l=50&t=40"], "top_img": "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/full/19402/kenya-moore.png?p=120741&w=760&l=50&t=40", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://christiantoday.com/article/kenya-moore-on-pregnancy-status-when-i-am-ready-to-say-i-will-tell-the-world/120741.htm", "title": "Kenya Moore on pregnancy status: 'When I am ready to say, I will tell the world'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "p": {"domain_verify": "edb0984d11c94fc2828120186bade850"}, "title": "Kenya Moore on pregnancy status: 'When I am ready to say, I will tell the world'", "description": "After being seen in November outside a fertility center in Barbados, &quot;Real Housewives of Atlanta&quot; (RHOA) star Kenya Moore seemed to be shying away on her pregnancy status.", "Keywords": "christian news,christianity,evangelical,Kenya Moore,rhoa,Real Housewives of Atlanta Kenya Moore pregnant,Real Housewives of Atlanta rumors,real housewives of atlanta,Kenya Moore update,Kenya Moore news", "og": {"url": "https://www.christiantoday.com/article/kenya-moore-on-pregnancy-status-when-i-am-ready-to-say-i-will-tell-the-world/120741.htm", "title": "Kenya Moore on pregnancy status: 'When I am ready to say, I will tell the world'", "type": "article", "description": "After being seen in November outside a fertility center in Barbados, \"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" (RHOA) star Kenya Moore seemed to be shying away on her pregnancy status.", "image": "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/full/19402/kenya-moore.png?p=120741&w=760&l=50&t=40"}, "fb": {"app_id": 105496396833914, "pages": 188340264915}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ChristianToday", "title": "Kenya Moore on pregnancy status: 'When I am ready to say, I will tell the world'", "description": "After being seen in November outside a fertility center in Barbados, \"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" (RHOA) star Kenya Moore seemed to be shying away on her pregnancy status.", "image": "https://christiantoday-4cf9.kxcdn.com/en/full/19402/kenya-moore.png?p=120741&w=760&l=50&t=40"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.christiantoday.com", "summary": ""}
