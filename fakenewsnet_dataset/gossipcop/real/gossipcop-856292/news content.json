He wondered, in vain, if they could drop him in by chopper this time, \u201cwhich is so clueless of me, because there\u2019s no landing pad, and it would mar the beauty of it all,\u201d he said. Hamill is a youthful 65 but a sexagenarian nevertheless; whereas the fit young members of the crew were given 45 minutes to get up to the now iconic Rey-Luke meeting spot\u2014carrying heavy equipment\u2014Hamill was allotted an hour and a half, \u201cand I had to stop every 10, 15 minutes to rest.\u201d\n\nNone of this was offered up in the form of complaint. Hamill just happens to be a rambling, expansive talker\u2014in his own way, as endearingly offbeat a character as his friend and on-screen twin sister, Carrie Fisher, who passed away suddenly and tragically last December. Like Fisher, Hamill was put on a diet-and-exercise regimen after he was reconscripted into the Star Wars franchise. (Harrison Ford was under less obligation, having retained his leading-man shape because he never stopped being a leading man.) Over a spartan snack plate of carrot sticks and hummus, the man behind Luke held forth at length on this subject.\n\nWatch the video below for a behind-the-scenes look at Annie Leibovitz\u2019s photo shoot with The Last Jedi cast and crew.\n\n\u201cYou just cut out all the things you love,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething as basic as bread and butter, which I used to start every meal with. Sugar. No more candy bars. No more stops at In-N-Out. It\u2019s really just a general awareness, because in the old days I\u2019d go, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not that hungry, but oh, here\u2019s a box of Wheat Thins,\u2019 and you don\u2019t put the Wheat Thins in the same category as Lay\u2019s potato chips, and yet I would sort of idly, absentmindedly eat these things while watching Turner Classic Movies, and \u2018Oh, I ate the whole box!\u2019 \u201d\n\nHamill had been dieting and training for 50 weeks before he learned, via the Episode VII script he finally received from Abrams, that he would not appear in the movie until its last scene, and in a nonspeaking part at that. On this, too, he has a lot of thoughts. Though he grants that the delayed-gratification reveal of Luke was a narrative masterstroke, he\u2019d have done things differently if he\u2019d had his druthers. Han Solo\u2019s death scene, for example. Why couldn\u2019t Luke have made his first appearance around then? In the finished film, the witnesses to Han\u2019s death, at the hands of his own son, the brooding dark-side convert Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), are his longtime Wookiee co-pilot, Chewbacca, and the upstart Resistance fighters Rey and Finn (John Boyega).", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6554dc8c30035d74eb12f6cd/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924579852a3f44dc6f3a8a9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss10.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592457a5dffe772993b30b3f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss14.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924578952a3f44dc6f3a8a5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655be0f4718f13955438af15/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65675621abc4b13e1de2a84d/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592457a53695284c0188d4c5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss13.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655cfbefa6beacd4a7377d24/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924578a9658080c3abf711b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss05.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59245798b2306f2287537fd1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss09.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592457a5dffe772993b30b3d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss12.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/56ec46abffeffc951764dfec/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65522d13a2c23d1d7b827cc7/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592457a5dffe772993b30b3c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss11.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924972da697a436a685292e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-longform-a.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924578a34765321e4a464ac/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592334b734765321e4a46484/1:1/pass/t-SW-Covers-02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592457989658080c3abf711d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss07.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59245798dffe772993b30b39/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss06.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592457899658080c3abf7119/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/64a43d414bf5235b00ae41d3/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924578952a3f44dc6f3a8a7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6552929cddf21fb34a59b593/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65679bde066ca7748a5cbf22/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59245798b2306f2287537fcf/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss08.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924972da697a436a685292e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-longform-a.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "David Kamp", "Annie Leibovitz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/star-wars-the-last-jedi-cover-portfolio", "title": "Cover Story: Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the Definitive Preview", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Star Wars devotees who can\u2019t wait for December need look no further.
