During middle school he became involved in a school band.[9] He studied at Seoul Practical Music High School,[10] but dropped out in 10th grade to pursue a music career.[11] He later attended Chungwoon University before transferring to Myongji University, where he received a master's degree in film and musical studies.[12]\n\nCareer\n\n2005\u20132014: Career beginnings\n\nIn 2005, Jonghyun was scouted by SM Entertainment when he was 15 years old, after playing in a song festival with his band at school.[13][14] Jonghyun debuted as part of the five-member boy group Shinee on May 25, 2008, on SBS' Inkigayo.[15] In 2009, Jonghyun started contributing to the group as a songwriter, writing the lyrics to their fourth Korean single, \"Juliette\", which was included on the group's second EP, Romeo. Jonghyun said he was inspired by the 1968 film Romeo and Juliet, and he wanted to write a romance story that \"will make everyone interested but also a story which everyone can identify with\".[16][17]\n\nIn October 2010, Jonghyun was one of twenty idols from various South Korean groups that recorded the song \"Let's Go\", which promoted the 2010 G-20 Seoul summit.

The song, which Jonghyun gave to IU as a friend, was also co-written by Jonghyun and dubbed a duet.[24] Two months later, Son Dam-bi released the song \"Red Candle\", which was also composed and written by Jonghyun.[25]\n\nIn February 2014, Jonghyun debuted as a radio host on the MBC radio program Blue Night [ko].[26] MBC said they chose Jonghyun to host because of his dedication to music-related activities and passion for music.[27] After a four-year hiatus, SM the Ballad returned on February 13, 2014, with a new line-up and their second EP, Breath.[28] Jonghyun performed the title track \"Breath\" as a collaboration with Girls' Generation's Taeyeon.[29] In August 2014, fellow Shinee member Taemin released his first EP, Ace, for which Jonghyun wrote the track \"Pretty Boy\".[30][31]\n\n2015\u20132016: Base, Story Op.1 and She Is\n\nJonghyun performing at the showcase for his debut album, Base, in January 2015.\n\nOn January 12, 2015, Jonghyun made his solo debut with his first EP, Base.[32] The lead track was originally the upbeat \"Crazy (Guilty Pleasure)\", which Jonghyun wrote the lyrics to.

The album peaked at number one on both the Billboard World Albums Chart and the Gaon Album Chart.[34][35] On January 10, television network Mnet confirmed that Jonghyun would appear on the entertainment program 4 Things Show. Taemin, Davichi's Minkyung and Zion.T appeared as Jonghyun's friends during the episode.[36]\n\nIn March 2015, Jonghyun composed and wrote the song \"Playboy\", which was included in Exo's second Korean album, Exodus.[37] A month later, Lim Kim released \"No More\" on her third EP, Simple Mind, which was also composed and written by Jonghyun.

It was a space where he could explore new things, express himself and connect with the public on a deeper level: ''Before, I think I was more comfortable being \"the singer Kim Jonghyun.\" [...] Because it was the one I [and the public] was used to. However, that changed when I started doing radio. As I started expressing my human side to others, I became [more] comfortable with the image of Kim Jonghyun that I revealed through radio.'' He also enjoyed the routine that came with hosting the midnight radio show. It gave him a sense of stability, which is rare in the entertainment industry.[11]\n\nHe released his second compilation album, titled Story Op.2, on April 24, 2017.[57] Jonghyun held a series of 20 concerts, titled The Agit (The Letter), between May and July, 2017, at the SM Town Coex Artium in Seoul.

He received emergency CPR treatment. However, he failed to regain consciousness and was pronounced dead at the hospital at around 6:32 PM, aged 27.[78][82][83] Investigators believe he died from inhaling either toxic fumes or smoke, as they discovered coal briquettes burnt on a frying pan upon arriving at the apartment.[82] The police stated that, at the request of Jonghyun's family, a post-mortem would not be carried out,[84] and they declared his death a possible suicide.[85]\n\nJonghyun's funeral was held in Asan Medical Center's funeral hall in Pungnam-dong, Seoul, starting the afternoon of December 19.[86] Celebrities, such as BTS, IU, BoA, Girls' Generation, and Exo,[87] and fans attended the three-day public funeral.[88][89] Moreover, international fans also paid tribute to the singer around the world.[90][91][92] On December 21, following the public funeral, Jonghyun was moved from the hospital to a private funeral attended only by his family and close friends, and was then laid to rest in an undisclosed location.[93][94][95]\n\nJonghyun's death was linked to depression by various media outlets.[96][11] Following Jonghyun's death, fellow singer and friend Nine9, of the band Dear Cloud, posted on Instagram Jonghyun's suicide note which he had sent to her two or three days before his December 9 concert.[97][98] The note referred to a \"devouring\" depression and his struggles with fame.[97] Nine9 was alarmed by the note and was advised by her agency to keep in touch with Jonghyun.[97] She had tried to help him, but this only \"delayed his passing\" and \"did not prevent it\".[99]\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter Jonghyun's death, the hashtags \"#StayStrongShawols\"[100][101] and \"#YouDidWellJonghyun\" became trending topics on Twitter.[102] On December 30, 2017, Jonghyun debuted on Billboard's Social 50 chart at number two with 425,000 Wikipedia views, a boost of 17,974 percent.[103] Jonghyun's death opened discussions about the harsh and competitive nature of the entertainment business in South Korea, as well as mental health.[104]\n\nJonghyun's single \"Lonely\" rose to the top of South Korea's online music stores.[105] The song re-entered the country's national Gaon Digital Chart at number one, and the compilation album Story Op.2 ranked number seven on the Gaon Album Chart.[106] His first album She Is charted at number four.[107] The single and compilation album also ranked number six on Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart and number five on its World Albums Chart.[108] Moreover, Jonghyun's book Skeleton Flower was re-released and became a bestseller following his death.[109][110]\n\nJonghyun's appearance on the variety show Night Goblin was scheduled to air on December 24, 2017, but JTBC decided not to broadcast it.[111] Shinee was slated to have a series of concerts in Japan in February 2018, and after discussion,[112] they decided to hold the concerts as scheduled.[113]\n\nTributes\n\nMany musicians and industry professionals around the world mourned Jonghyun's death.
