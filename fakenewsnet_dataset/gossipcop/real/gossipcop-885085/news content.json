Until Dewayne showed up,\u201d he wrote ominously, the latest in an ongoing feud between him and the former WWE champion.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n\u201cI tried to warn you guys,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou thought I was hating...... I was simply fighting to keep the family together.\u201d Doubtless Gibson is feeling more than a little aggrieved that Johnson is getting his own movie before the gang gets back together to film Fast & Furious 9, and this is not the first time he\u2019s called his co-star out on social media for trying to make the franchise all about The Rock. The ninth movie has been delayed a full year to April 10, 2020, while Johnson and Statham\u2019s spinoff, inspired by their delightful chemistry during The Fate of the Furious, is coming July 26, 2019. The spinoff news came only a day after the delay announcement, and Gibson smelled a rat.\n\nIn light of the news, Johnson simply tweeted, \u201cMy goal from day 1 was to come in and create an exciting/fun character for the fans, elevate the franchise and build it out. #HobbsShaw2019.\u201d He didn\u2019t address Gibson\u2019s concerns directly, but, listen, the fans can tell.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6564cb9e766ac2eb76f98953/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655e2cea2d366cc54973895c/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660159ee60bb2d438ba5ff/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6546771e963d91daf65d36da/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655b839284fa2321786531bc/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58ebf0ee4a7c9f7d59c2cd42/1:1/pass/vin-diesel-dwayne-johnson-feud.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6553a3f7b8161e6f4de402d0/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58ee513575dd30329d3c49f1/1:1/pass/fast-furious-corona.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655be0f4718f13955438af15/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6543b39907bf8f27ba8294e1/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655e25f3380edb234a2d6403/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/656510d0affa7b4408631071/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f4da740ba2cf01fc200a86/1:1/pass/fate-of-the-furious%25202.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Emma Stefansky"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/tyrese-gibson-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-fast-and-furious-feud", "title": "Tyrese Gibson Calls The Rock a \u201cClown\u201d for Breaking Up the Fast & Furious Family", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Fast spinoff is underway while the ninth movie in the series remains delayed.", "id": "59d909548b8c201cbafcea88", "keywords": "tyrese gibson,dwayne ` the rock ' johnson,fast and furious,vin diesel", "news_keywords": "tyrese gibson,dwayne ` the rock ' johnson,fast and furious,vin diesel", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59d909548b8c201cbafcea88", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Fast spinoff is underway while the ninth movie in the series remains delayed.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Fast spinoff is underway while the ninth movie in the series remains delayed.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Tyrese Gibson Calls The Rock a \u201cClown\u201d for Breaking Up the Fast & Furious Family", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/tyrese-gibson-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-fast-and-furious-feud"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-10-07T18:20:20.201Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-07T18:20:20.201Z", "author": "Emma Stefansky"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Fast spinoff is underway while the ninth movie in the series remains delayed.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Tyrese Gibson Calls The Rock a \u201cClown\u201d for Breaking Up the Fast & Furious Family"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d919e253aed21896830b0b/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-680213600.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507400420.201, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
