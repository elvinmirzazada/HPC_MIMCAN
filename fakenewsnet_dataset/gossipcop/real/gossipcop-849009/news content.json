While attending Andres Serrano\u2019s show at Frieze New York, a guest was about to snap a photo of portraits of Donald Trump and Snoop Dogg hanging side-by-side when who should show up but Martha Stewart, armed with the bird in one hand and a peace sign in the other.\n\nThe photo, first spotted by The Cut, quickly went viral, with more than 3,000 likes on the original photo at time of writing.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nNeither Stewart nor Snoop is a big fan of Trump, the former voicing her support for Hillary Clinton throughout last year\u2019s campaign, and the latter having just released a music video featuring himself \u201cshooting\u201d a clown dressed as Trump.\n\nStewart shared a more safe-for-work version of the photo on her own Instagram account\u2014as well as an announcement about her show with Snoop on VH1:\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nSo, that\u2019s twenty more episodes of Martha and Snoop\u2019s Potluck Dinner Party, plus the two will be appearing at Sunday\u2019s 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards. And what better way to advertise it than by crashing an art show and flipping the bird at the president? If Snoop\u2019s not around, at least Stewart had a convenient portrait to stand in for him.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6566170fa07f97a6dc41374c/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/1:1/pass/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/65660f10fa28999da8edabc8/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/655ccc3505c13bc519c0d468/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5810fead2d5899f533f7c12f/1:1/pass/martha-stewart-sexted.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6516f18d66eef8a3c2f54d57/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/656510d0affa7b4408631071/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Emma Stefansky"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/05/martha-stewart-donald-trump-middle-finger", "title": "Martha Stewart Appears to Give Donald Trump the Middle Finger", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "She crashed an Instagram with portraits of Trump and Snoop Dogg.", "id": "590f4f0f5caad73f2ce0cc95", "keywords": "martha stewart,snoop dogg,donald trump,andres serrano", "news_keywords": "martha stewart,snoop dogg,donald trump,andres serrano", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "590f4f0f5caad73f2ce0cc95", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"She crashed an Instagram with portraits of Trump and Snoop Dogg.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She crashed an Instagram with portraits of Trump and Snoop Dogg.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Martha Stewart Appears to Give Donald Trump the Middle Finger", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/05/martha-stewart-donald-trump-middle-finger"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-05-07T18:52:25.034Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-07T18:52:25.034Z", "author": "Emma Stefansky"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "She crashed an Instagram with portraits of Trump and Snoop Dogg.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Martha Stewart Appears to Give Donald Trump the Middle Finger"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494183145.034, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
