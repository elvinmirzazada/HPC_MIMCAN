Last year, spending on Cyber Monday surpassed $2 billion, and 2015 is already being projected as the largest single online shopping day of ALL TIME! In addition to more retailers taking part in the event, we are also seeing an increase in Cyber Monday ads. While putting together a shopping plan has been difficult in previous years, all of the important information is now right here. As you may have noticed with Black Friday, stores are also getting a head start and starting Cyber Monday on Sunday. Here is the important information that you need to know to maximize your savings this year\n\nTop Cyber Monday Ads\n\nWhat started out as collection of small, single pages ads a few years back has transormed into 40-page flyers, many of which look awfully similiar to their Black Friday counterparts. While every store does not have an ad yet, the number is increasing every single year as well as the effort by the stores, which is great news for anyone looking to quickly find the best deals. Here are the ads that you need to see if you are looking to maximize your savings.\n\nWalmart 9-Page Ad - C+ Rating\n\n\n\nThis sale starts Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8 p.m.\n\nWhile it's all glitz and glam with Walmart and their Black Friday ad and sale announcement, they fall short when it comes to Cyber Monday. Their 9-page ad leaves a lot to be desired in many ways. Besides the lack of total electronics, deals such as the White Xbox One bundle for $299.99 is already available on their website for the same price today! While it's still a great deal, we expect new and better discounts for the biggest online shopping day of the year. The 48\" Samsung HDTV on the front page is also the same price that stores offered on Black Friday for very similar models. Nothing in this ad is bad per say, it just lacks the electrontronics, total number of deals and new low prices that we expect. Free pickup at your local store is avaialble, but you must meet a minimum of $50 for orders to your home. While not unique, the Xbox One deal and two HDTV deals are saving this sale from being rated below a C+.\n\nTarget 40-Page Ad - B Rating\n\nThis sale starts Sunday, November 29, 2015.\n\nWhile we consider Target's ad better than the Walmart one in both size and selection, it is not without its problems. The best part of the sale is the 15% off on Monday only at Target.com with coupon code: CYBER15. The first page featured deal, the Samsung 4K Ultra HDTV with a $100 Target gift card for $599.99, is a decent deal, but not spectacular. A few other retailers offered this same size with similar specs for $499.99 on Black Friday, which gives you the direct discount immediately. Target is offering the same overall net price, but the total discount will be delayed since it is gift card based. Another disappointment is the PS4 Uncharted Bundle for $349.99. During Black Friday, every store had this bundle for $299.99 or less, so paying $50 more is not desirable at all. Regardless, they still have 30% off a variety of items including apparel, shoes, accessories and toys. Other items are marked off as much as 50%. One of the biggest draws is the free shipping with no minimum order size.\n\n\n\nBest Buy 24-Page Ad - A Rating\n\nThis sale starts Sunday, November 29, 2015.\n\nAs the winner of top Black Friday ad of the year, Best Buy has done it again with their extensive Cyber Monday ad. While Walmart and Target cut back on the electronics a bit, Best Buy has kept given us another diverse selection. An interesting deal is on the first page and allows you to obtain a $300 Best Buy gift card when you trade-in a working smartphone and lease or activate a Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+ or a Note 5. Page 10 is even dedicated to Apple electronics. While the selection is a tad watered-down compared to their Apple offering on Black Friday, not a ton of other stores are advertiisng Apple products at all, so this could be your best chance. The most interesting item in the sale is the Apple Watch on page 11. While a price is not actually announced, we assume it will be marked down by $50 to $100 like it was on Black Friday.\n\nAll Cyber Monday Ads\n\nWhile not quite important enough to make our top list, there are a ton of other Cyber Monday ads that you need to see. Amazon, Dell, eBay, Sears, Toys R Us and many other stores all have digital ads available this year, and the competition is becoming fierce already.\n\nView all of the available 2015 Cyber Monday Ads\n\nFree Shipping on Cyber Monday\n\nFree shipping is an extremely crucial part of any successful Cyber Monday shopping plan of attack. As we previously noted in our Free Shipping Terms for Stores on Black Friday and Thanksgiving article, you will pay on average $6.78 extra if you do not meet most store's minimum order totals to be eligible for free shipping. This can absolutely kill the savings for small purchases, and we highly recommend you do not paying shipping charges on Cyber Monday. Here are a few of the more important stores and their shipping terms.\n\nFree Shipping, No Minimum Order Size:\n\n- Apple\n\n- Best Buy\n\n- Dell\n\n- Target\n\nFree Shipping, Minimum Order Size:\n\n- Walmart $50\n\n- Kohl's $50\n\n- JCPenney $49\n\n- Amazon $35\n\n- Toys R Us $19", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/user_files/12-11-2014/100_x_100_cvs_1415780293.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/app/bbf-logo-favicon.ico", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/tmp/26-08-2013/macyside_1377542438.jpg/115_0.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/media/content/images/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/user_files/10-11-2014/target_logo_100_1415637823.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/user_files/20-11-2014/amazonadlogo_1416535713.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/user_files/12-11-2014/walmartad_1415777604.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/user_files/07-11-2014/kmartlogo_1415417156.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/user_files/11-11-2014/offcedepot-offi_1415726767.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cyber-monday-2015-logo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/user_files/08-11-2014/kohls_100_x_100_1415469503.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/tmp/26-08-2013/walmartside_1377542192.gif/115_0.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/tmp/26-08-2013/amazonside_1377542097.gif/115_0.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/tmp/16-10-2013/hp_logo_115_x_4_1381979823.jpg/115_0.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://forms.aweber.com/form/displays.htm?id=jAwszJyMTAwcrA==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/tiny_images/walmart-cyber-monday-ad.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/user_files/24-10-2014/kmartlogo_1414166338.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/amazon-cyber-monday-2015.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/user_files/09-11-2014/jcpenneyadlogo_1415551395.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/media/content/images/icons/search-icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/tmp/04-09-2013/targettopstore_1378273860.jpg/115_0.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/user_files/04-11-2014/sears_100_x_100_1415135592.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/best-buy-cyber-monday.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/target-cyber-monday-ad.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/user_files/13-11-2014/toys_r_us_100_x_1415918918.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808im_/http://bestblackfriday.com/app/bbf-logo-favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20151128220808/http://bestblackfriday.com/cyber-monday", "title": "Best Cyber Monday 2015 Deals & Sales", "meta_data": {"description": "Click to view the latest Cyber Monday 2015 Deals & Sales presented by BestBlackFriday.com.
