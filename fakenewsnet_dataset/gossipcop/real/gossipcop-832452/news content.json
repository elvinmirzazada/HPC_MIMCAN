News reported on Monday.\n\nAccording to Warner\u2019s attorney, Shawn Holley, she\u2019s been battling insomnia, which prompted her to be under the influence of a prescribed sleep aid.\n\n'RHONY' STAR LUANN D'AGOSTINO'S DAUGHTER VICTORIA ARRESTED FOR DWI\n\n\u201cWe have letters and reports from Jackie\u2019s doctors which prove a long history of insomnia and which strongly support our contention that Jackie was driving unconscious after taking Ambien, which had been prescribed to her,\u201d Holley told TMZ.\n\n\u201cI reached out to the D.A.\u2019s Office weeks ago and was assured that deputies would review our reports before filing charges,\" Holley added. \"We are extremely disappointed that the D.A.\u2019s Office filed these charges without reviewing our evidence, as promised.\u201d\n\nThe West Los Angeles Sheriff told E! News that there were no injuries and that Warner\u2019s vehicle rolled back, prompting it to hit a police car. Warner got out of the car without issue and was reportedly compliant with officials on the scene before the arrest. Police aren\u2019t sure how the car rolled back and the case has been assigned to a detective.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Warner has faced trouble.\n\nAfter her reality TV series, \u201cWork Out,\u201d ended on Bravo in 2010, she sold her Beverly Hills gym. On her website, Warner revealed that after she turned 40, she \u201cfell into [a] crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like doing the type of TV that I was doing, which made me uncomfortable and uneasy,\u201d wrote Warner. \u201cI had succeeded in many ways, but always had very tumultuous relationships, which caused me quite a lot of misery. Shortly thereafter, I sold my clinic and gym and found myself wondering what\u2019s next? My last TV show didn\u2019t do well and the shooting conditions were so bad that I vowed never to do television again unless it was a fully positive experience.\"\n\nWarner also added that she \u201cquit drinking for a year and I quit dating for a year,\u201d as well as relied on prayer to help her find a new purpose in life. Warner insisted that after hitting the gym more, she was \u201cmentally and physically stronger than I have ever been in my life.\u201d\n\nWarner\u2019s arraignment is scheduled for Apr. 19.", "images": ["https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ETHandout_Getty_JackieWarner.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/rita-moreno.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/683a7afc-c45b-45d1-a66e-c2bf3c642000/eb427261-ddd9-47ac-b6b3-dc3323584be5/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/1b7923a2-2827-4275-b995-744d798cec60/2b91178d-146a-4dad-b944-0c6aa604b9bc/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/560a8fea-9cd0-47f9-8178-596cc0e8d016/6905e13d-6013-4683-b922-023ad181ce11/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/8cdf518d-16a0-44a8-a002-8919b8e78c95/37fdb63a-e06e-4b1c-a071-3256ef0e5667/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_ENT-532x120.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/jill-duggar.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/ETHandout_Getty_JackieWarner.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ETHandout_Getty_JackieWarner.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/fitness-star-jackie-warner-arrested-for-dui-and-assault-on-a-police-officer", "title": "Fitness star Jackie Warner arrested for DUI and assault on a police officer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "description": "According to Warner\u2019s attorney Shawn Holley, she\u2019s been battling insomnia, which prompted her to be under the influence of a prescribed sleep aid.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Fitness star Jackie Warner arrested for DUI and assault on a police officer", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:49cacdca-95c4-5ede-b1cf-2f1584623cbf", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-04-18", "dcterms.created": "2017-04-18T12:19:16-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-04-18T12:50:45-04:00", "og": {"title": "Fitness star Jackie Warner arrested for DUI and assault on a police officer", "description": "According to Warner\u2019s attorney Shawn Holley, she\u2019s been battling insomnia, which prompted her to be under the influence of a prescribed sleep aid.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ETHandout_Getty_JackieWarner.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/fitness-star-jackie-warner-arrested-for-dui-and-assault-on-a-police-officer", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Fitness star Jackie Warner arrested for DUI and assault on a police officer", "description": "According to Warner\u2019s attorney Shawn Holley, she\u2019s been battling insomnia, which prompted her to be under the influence of a prescribed sleep aid.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/ETHandout_Getty_JackieWarner.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/fitness-star-jackie-warner-arrested-for-dui-and-assault-on-a-police-officer"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/EVENTS/Arrest,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "arrest,entertainment", "classification-tags": "arrest,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
