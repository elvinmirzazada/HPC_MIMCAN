She added that the misleading promos include \u201clies\u201d about her leaving \u201cNCIS\u201d to focus on cosmetics.\n\n\u201cThey caught \u2019em!\u201d the actress tweeted Thursday. \u201cHopefully these false ads will end now! I DON\u2019T have a skin care line!\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, she wrote, \u201cI\u2019M NOT LEAVING NCIS FOR A SKIN CARE LINE! I\u2019m leaving, but that\u2019s not why.\u201d\n\n\u201cNCIS\u201d fans have been struggling to grapple with Perrette\u2019s impending departure after she announced last month that the show\u2019s currently airing Season 15 will be her last. She has not given a specific reason for walking away.\n\nPerrette\u2019s latest tweet is below.\n\nThey caught \u2018em! Hopefully these false ads will end now!
