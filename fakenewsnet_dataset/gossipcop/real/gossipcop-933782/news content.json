That\u2019s our Mother\u2019s Day episode,\u201d Pinkett Smith said. \u201cI thought it was important to have that conversation because she was my entry point to motherhood. I was co-mothering with her. At that particular time, before [having a blended family] was popular, before it was even an idea, we were trying to create something that we had never experienced.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWe came from broken homes. We didn\u2019t have a blueprint. We just had an idea. This is what we think we want. This is what we want to try to do for Trey.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

It\u2019s constantly unfolding. I think now after 23 years we just have a maturity and an understanding that it\u2019s a process,\u201d Pinkett Smith agreed.\n\nJim Smeal/REX/Shutterstock\n\nPinkett Smith hosts the new show alongside her mother as well as her 17-year-old daughter, singer Willow Smith.\n\n\u201cRed Table Talk is about raw truth, love and deep passion. My mother is old school, Willow is new school, and I find myself right in the middle,\u201d Pinkett Smith told PEOPLE. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of sharing and growing on Facebook. Being able to engage with the Facebook Watch community in such a deeply personal way is amazing, and I\u2019m excited to be part of something new.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a 17-year-old, it\u2019s important for me to be able to talk openly about what\u2019s going on in my life \u2026 there have been too many times I have felt alone,\u201d Willow said.\n\nRed Table Talk will premiere on Facebook\u2019s video platform, Facebook Watch, on Monday, May 7.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/-80QsI-uiBQiM070UX0jxOxatzs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x539:941x541)/will-smith-sheree-zampino-1-84fe09ccd2774207bea93bfc38f7d6b2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/5oq9U34AHzM-B_BLfUQmjsWByvw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x9:736x11)/will-smith-coachella-jaden-willow-041723-f77b1e34bc9f40cabe7bb1172c28376f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/63xzNvkPhV6jnYAQSyE-Ps7PKHU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x438:941x440)/will-smith-family-1-2f2d069077c34103b3ff5a10059d8f09.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tTlHoLVwx3CIXoNWo4QmqvXRiJw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/gettyimages-155215051-1-2000-2f9e1a500a0e4c9193f13415e4a08072.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/OtykGDdDbkLZihb3xDFk-wKNnjA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/shutterstock_editorial_5528313mj_huge-1-2000-b719d08eec3b4264a0e017915b6c5cab.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2gCwer16ZRARfIB6vOBUqH_uBPA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(539x0:541x2)/sheree-zampino-trey-smith-101922-b51747f0ea814d0db1f02e433e9f6803.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/bN88UEqJhK2fiNJ4J2T0p5qzuSo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/jana-kramer-1-88116f811b42454795d5e550285ade64.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/WSVmRTQ32L6fQOZg4pAizhJIbcA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/red-table-talk-7f864c1fb8e44dc5be6add8dffd2ddec.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/DvW9JI2GW3hjGnq1CdHaz0Zrjqk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Jada-Pinkett-Smith-and-Willow-Smith-b4bba3f9ca3b43d6b8e65601c6abb751.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rnZPe6FuiKNAwF8ujb38o7kEiuk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x0:961x2)/Red-Table-Talk-Elizabeth-Smart-200beb5228ae4b388d344f31f02322a8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jpPclgQUUHtiwlUdnaHt6si3ScY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/jada-will-1-2000-13583f6af5b34c659875a9dfbebb15f9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/STkGUG9z6cjkWhyhMAbUc5ueds0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x209:736x211)/Jada-Pinkett-Smith-2-0e97b7182d7644d0a85b12c967592cdf.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-8i7gospwcFToX_vuEHit5bbaSw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x638:981x640)/Adrienne-Banfield-Black-Love-Summit-111422-2-1ea39f3deb624a5b90e2ac3f438ac9c7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/njZhXXmS8Pw_7n8_k-nq74FnH4I=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x9:736x11)/debbie-allen-jada-pinkett-121622-a0c4230b4ddc40b9b1acedf1fda7d794.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/xnYduMZrBehg_QB6FbirW13yFX8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x139:736x141)/nick-cannon-red-table-talk-043023-c200eb8842ac449a8a52c40a37f458b5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/pAaQ_xfJaGILKOqDtdbF1UygNXM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x318:941x320)/jada-pinkett-sheree-zampino-101922-2-9cd557db056344b68d8beda3e741205c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0Y0jppwicvYUFERPZVj1CqwfVoo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x299:676x301)/Jada-Pinkett-Smith-49c10033375b4b11a75f62e515523bae.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/QPz1g7L46oRdVVSSMJylvbrAcNI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x459:736x461)/celeb-stepparents-2-4b9333ccc4734f89b498ef4decdf59a0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/AMQSZQFpR-hab5z2_Z844XLLHSQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x465:751x467)/red-table-talk-083122-c9000bb6852d4bfeb75b6035b7e0d850.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/jpPclgQUUHtiwlUdnaHt6si3ScY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/jada-will-1-2000-13583f6af5b34c659875a9dfbebb15f9.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Staff Editor For Human Interest S Digital Vertical At People.
