The 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards will be held on Sunday, May 7 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California. While we wait, let's reminisce over how outstanding last year was!

The high wattage of A-list celebs was so bright, we almost needed shades as 'Mad Max: Fury Road's own Charlize Theron accepted the award for Best Female Performance, and heartthrob/hero Chris Pratt earned the Golden Popcorn for Best Action Performance. Ryan Reynolds got down with a few twerking Deadpools and Salt-N-Pepa when winning the award for Best Comedic performance, while Melissa McCarthy crowdsurfed her way to the stage to become the first woman ever to win the Comedic Genius Award.
