A 2013 sequel grossed more than $176 million domestically.\n\nWatch the interview below.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KC-Chiefs-Travis-Kelce.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ferellfederer.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ferellfederer.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/robbie-rogers-fellow-travelers.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fallon-kelce.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jeff-Shell.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ferellfederer.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Raquel 'Rocky' Harris", "Sharon Knolle", "Dessi Gomez", "Stephanie Kaloi", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/will-ferrell-ron-burgundy-roger-federer-australian-open/", "title": "Watch Will Ferrell\u2019s Ron Burgundy Interview Roger Federer at Australian Open (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch Will Ferrell's Ron Burgundy Interview Roger Federer at Australian Open (Video) - TheWrap", "description": "\"Are you a witch or a vampire?\" Ferrell's character from \"Anchorman\" asks the tennis legend", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/will-ferrell-ron-burgundy-roger-federer-australian-open/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ferellfederer.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-01-17T16:03:24+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Watch Will Ferrell\u2019s Ron Burgundy Interview Roger Federer at Australian Open (Video)", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/will-ferrell-ron-burgundy-roger-federer-australian-open/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-01-17T08:03:24-08:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "parsely-tags": "adam_mckay, anchorman, david_koechner, john-mcenroe, john-mcintosh, mark_wahlberg, paul_rudd, roger-federer, ron_burgundy, steve_carell, will_ferrell", "article-tags": "adam_mckay, anchorman, david_koechner, john-mcenroe, john-mcintosh, mark_wahlberg, paul_rudd, roger-federer, ron_burgundy, steve_carell, will_ferrell}", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "culture, sports-category-column, tv, videos", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516205004.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
