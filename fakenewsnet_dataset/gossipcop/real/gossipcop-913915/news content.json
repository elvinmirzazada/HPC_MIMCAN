The two are also parents to daughter North, 4, and Saint, 1.\n\nAt the time of baby Chi's arrival, Kim announced the exciting news via her app.\n\n\"We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care,\" she wrote on behalf of her and Kanye. \"North and Saint are especially thrilled to welcome their baby sister.\"\n\nHear more on their precious family in the video below!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fkim_kanye_gettyimages-601351408.jpg%3Fh%3D6f174951&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fkim_kanye_gettyimages-601351408.jpg%3Fh%3D6f174951&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-02/armie_getty925692044.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/kim_kanye_gettyimages-601351408.jpg?h=6f174951", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/kim_kanye_gettyimages-601351408.jpg?h=6f174951", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kanye-west-reactivates-instagram-to-wish-kim-kardashian-a-happy-valentines-day-96419", "title": "Kanye West Reactivates Instagram to Wish Kim Kardashian a Happy Valentine's Day", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/kim_kanye_gettyimages-601351408.jpg?h=6f174951", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "He's back!", "title": "Kanye West Reactivates Instagram to Wish Kim Kardashian a Happy Valentine's Day", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kanye-west-reactivates-instagram-to-wish-kim-kardashian-a-happy-valentines-day-96419", "type": "Article"}, "description": "He's back!", "twitter": {"description": "He's back!", "title": "Kanye West Reactivates Instagram to Wish Kim Kardashian a Happy Valentine's Day", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kanye-west-reactivates-instagram-to-wish-kim-kardashian-a-happy-valentines-day-96419", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/kim_kanye_gettyimages-601351408.jpg?h=6f174951", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Kanye West Reactivates Instagram to Wish Kim Kardashian a Happy Valentine's Day | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, News, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 42, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
