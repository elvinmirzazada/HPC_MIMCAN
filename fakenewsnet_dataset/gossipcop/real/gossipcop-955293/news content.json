'\"If you don\u2019t like it, you can [switch].\"'\n\nThe star recently took the campaigns shots for his mother\u2019s new Reebok collection.\n\nOver the weekend Victoria posted a series of images shot by her son with the caption: \u2018Love seeing my Merch Collection through @BrooklynBeckham eyes\u2019.\n\n\n\nBeckham\u2019s big break in fashion came at the age of 16 when he first snapped photos for a Burberry fragrance campaign.\n\nThis is only the beginning for Brooklyn.", "images":
