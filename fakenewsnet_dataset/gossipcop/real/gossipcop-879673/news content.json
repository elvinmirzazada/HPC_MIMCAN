Thank you for coming to ours. Please continue to always write or comment about your days no matter what I share as when I see it I will return the love back someway or it will be read by someone else who can too.\n\n'I so wish that I could support you on all your walks and sad days so hopefully the posts I share will make you laugh or lighten your days or make you smile/brighten them somehow.\n\n'This is not a highlights nor lowlights reel, but simply an in-the-middle to keep in contact. I was very vulnerable in my last post as well as being at an all-time low and on such days I sometimes will feel the need for support, so thank you for being so kind to me and being a safe place.\n\n'We will try to be more transparent on our journey as I see it may be helpful for others as well as ourselves. We don\u2019t have to carry the weight of the world ourselves. We can help lift one another up.'\n\nDevastated: Mara, who welcomed her son Wolf with Jonathan last year, announced the couple's tragic news on social media, beside a drawing of a young girl stroking a lion\n\nMara also revealed the location of Willow's place of rest, writing: 'I have been given peace and Baby Willow is now planted in the tree in front of our home that has weeping long branches and leaves so we can brush our faces in soft leaves in passing or we can see the baby dance with the wind in the branches as they sway.\n\n'It is helping me process the situation \u2026 as Nature does. Thank you again Dr Stu for getting us through that as watching a sonogram not have a heartbeat is very surreal and beyond sad.\n\n'Thank you Father God for supernatural peace. May you afford those who seek you the same peace and may we grow as humans and have more compassion for all humanity.'\n\nMara, who welcomed her son Wolf with Jonathan last year, initially announced the couple's sad news on social media, beside a drawing of a young girl stroking a lion.\n\nTough time: Jonathan has now returned home with a sober living companion, after he was reportedly blocked from boarding a flight at Dublin airport (above)\n\nShe wrote beside the poignant image to fans: 'With much sadness, we open our hearts to share that J and I lost our second child, who was baking in the oven.'\n\nMara went on to admit her husband was struggling with the news - but fiercely praised his strength through his lengthy battle with alcoholism and depression, confirming that he had relapsed.\n\nShe continued: 'Child was very very much wanted (right now especially by J, so he took the news particularly not so well) and we are still working with coping skills over here... when life throws us curve balls such as these.\n\n'Depression is a real concern from past abuse as well as alcoholism which he was born with. He has been able to turn any ugliness and hurt in his life into art and is the strongest person I know.'\n\nBattling his demons: The star, who is a recovering alcoholic, was escorted to a seated area ahead of his flight to Vancouver, with onlookers revealing he appeared 'intoxicated'\n\nExpressing her admiration for the Tudors star further, she added: 'I do not know anyone who has been through what he has been through and reached his level of successes.'\n\nConfessing the battle does not come without its difficulties however, she went on to thank followers for their support - and for understanding his struggles as a serious mental health condition, without judgement.\n\n'It does seem though that every time we seem to be making so much progress...' she went on. 'Sometimes it's like two steps forward, one step back.\n\n'Thank you family and friends and all of you lovely kind beautiful people who send us good energy and thoughts and support. It is so appreciated. I have so much love for you.'\n\n'He is the strongest person I know': Mara went on to admit her husband was struggling with the news - but praised his strength through his lengthy battle with alcoholism and depression\n\nPassengers were said to be 'concerned' about the star, who was seen being escorted to a seated area ahead of his flight, with onlookers reporting to The Mirror newspaper that he appeared 'intoxicated'.\n\nJonathan is a recovering alcoholic who has had a well publicised battle with alcohol since first shooting to fame in 2002.\n\nOnlookers explained that Jonathan hadn't been causing any 'hassle' in the terminal, adding: 'It really looked like his demons had caught up with him again.'\n\nOne said: \u2018He was staggering around for a good while. He wasn\u2019t causing any hassle with anyone, he just seemed to be really intoxicated. It was very sad to see him like this.\u2019\n\nWorried: Other passengers on the transatlantic flight were said to be 'concerned' over the star, who has had a well publicised battle with alcohol since first shooting to fame in 2002\n\nIt's reported that he was not allowed onto the flight. MailOnline has contacted a representative for Jonathan.\n\n'To some,' Mara continued. 'My husband is an Irishman who battles alcoholism and depression and drank between jobs to try to cope with the sadness of this news.\n\n'I am trying to and still learning/adjusting to living with the public, like one would as a concerned mother-in-law.'\n\nShe went on to affirm her husband was embarking on a recovery program, and was preparing to enter a rehab facility to fight his demons.\n\nShe added: 'He is safe and with his sober living companion and bodyguard to get into a detox closer to home since he was denied hospital help twice in Ireland because of an already two month wait period.'\n\nFocusing on positive thoughts during the incredibly difficult time, she finished her inspirational note with a well-wish to those affected by Hurricane Irma - and urged fans to help others during their own tough patches in life.\n\nShe said: 'Life is life. Life is beautiful. Life is tough sometimes though so let's try not looking down at someone unless we intend on helping them up.\n\n'Sending love to those in... Texas, Florida, India and Mexico with all the natural disasters going on.\n\n'We are both so sensitive and the past couple of weeks have been so ouch in our hearts for all humans and animals affected.'\n\nHis appearance in Dublin may come as a shock to fans, as just last month Jonathan had been spotted busy filming for new movie The Aspern Papers, while looking happy and healthy in Venice.\n\n'He didn't have a clue where he was': Onlookers told The Mirror: 'It really looked like his demons had caught up with him again'\n\nThe actor's long-term battle is believed to have included numerous stints in rehab over the past few years.\n\nIn May 2005 he checked into Promises in Malibu, California, seeking treatment for alcohol abuse, before returning for treatment in 2007.\n\nThe actor then returned to rehab in February 2009 but was held by French police four months later when he was accused of assaulting employees at Charles de Gaulle airport while drunk. He was fined 1,000 euros by a French court for also threatening to kill three police officers. and given a suspended sentence for public intoxication.\n\nFollowing pictures of him surfacing drinking straight from a bottle of vodka on the street in 2015, Jonathan had publicly apologised to fans for his 'minor relapse'.\n\nHe penned via Instagram: 'Mara and I are thankful for your support and kindness during this time. I apologizes [sic] for having a minor relapse and hope that people don't think too badly of me.'\n\nJonathan assured fans it had been merely a 'blip' and assured his followers he was 'on the mend'.\n\nHe added: 'I am on the mend and thank well wishers and sorry for my dishevelled appearance as I was on my way home from a friends and had not changed I feel I made a mistake and feel quite embarrassed but this was just a blip in my recovery otherwise I\u2019m living a healthy life. Love and blessings.'\n\nJonathan has previously addressed his drinking in interviews, and insisted it had been 'blown out of proportion' while speaking to the Mail on Sunday's Live magazine to promote The Tudors - shortly after his mother died in November 2007.\n\n'I haven\u2019t even thought about drinking since my mother passed away. Drinking is not the way forward for me at all,' he said. 'I never even drank till I was 25 anyway. I was in Thailand on my own, filming. I was a little bit lonely and I started drinking.'\n\nHe added that the public's perception of him is all wrong, saying: 'I kind of like people having this idea that I\u2019m this wild, rebellious guy. But the reality is that I\u2019m not, and I\u2019m not quite sure I want to reveal how boring my life is.\n\n'Of course, as a young Irish actor you\u2019re tarred before you start. It\u2019s the enduring clich\u00e9. Since I was 27 I must have drunk maybe a dozen-and-a-half times \u2013 but when I do, I\u2019m like Bambi. I\u2019m all over the place, hopeless, like a 16-year-old kid. People notice.'\n\nJonathan said: \u2018Now drink doesn\u2019t fit into where I want to go. I want to do something useful with my life. Drinking is not synonymous with that. And I don\u2019t put any emphasis on it.\n\nCandid: Jonathan has previously addressed his drinking in interviews and claimed in 2013 and insisted he'd 'had enough' after realising he was 'hurting' his friends and family with his actions\n\n'To be honest, I just leave it alone and hope people will, too, but I don\u2019t really care. The whole drinking thing with me has been blown out of all proportion anyway.'\n\nHe later added in November 2013 in an interview with The Mirror: 'When you are on the front of newspapers for stupidity, getting drunk at airports, fighting with cops and stuff like that, you wake up the next day and you can hardly f***ing remember it.\n\n'Responsibility gets diminished. As you get older you see the stupid things you have done. It is not the consequences for yourself but your family get hurt, your friends get hurt.\n\n'It is kind of insanity to do it to that level. I was able to come to that realisation and I look for different things in life now.'\n\nHe defiantly added that he had made the decision to curb his drinking habits, insisting he'd 'had enough'.\n\nChange in fortune: Despite his woes, however, Jonathan has kept up a steady stream of acting jobs and has started a family with his partner Mara (pictured above)\n\nDespite his woes, however, Jonathan has kept up a steady stream of acting jobs and has started a family with his partner Mara.\n\nShe gave birth to his son nine months ago and is often seen gushing about Jonathan and his parenting skills on social media.\n\nMara credited her other half for being a natural when it comes to being a father, as she shared a cute family photo of herself and Jonathan with their baby boy.\n\nSpeaking about Jonathan, she penned: 'J is thee best Father btw (sic). Ridiculously loving, super protective, patient and attentive.'\n\nHer tribute gave an insight into the notoriously private pair's family life as she continued: 'Wolf is basically snuggled, kissed, adored, sang to and entertained any free minute he has by his Papa.'\n\nMara concluded with the hashtags: '#LuckyMom #BlessedWife.'", "images":
