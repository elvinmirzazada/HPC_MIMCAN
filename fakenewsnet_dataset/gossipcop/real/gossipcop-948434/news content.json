She accessorized her blonde curly locks with purple and pink flowers. Benchetrit opted for a blue suit on his special day.\n\nThe newlyweds began dating in 2016 after working together on the film Chien. This is Paradis' first marriage. Benchetrit was previously married to French actress Marie Trintignant from 1998 to 2003, with whom he shares 20-year-old son Jules. The writer also has an 11-year-old daughter, Saul, from his previous relationship with Anna Mouglalis.\n\nEarlier this week, Paradis reportedly missed the Paris premiere of her latest film, A Knife in the Heart, due to her son's \"serious health problems.\" Both she and Depp have yet to comment on the reports, however, a source told People on Thursday that Jack is doing fine.\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nET reached out to Paradis' rep for comment.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/vanessa_paradis_samuel_benchetrit_gettyimages-950509074.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-11%2Fet_depp_110116_1280.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-05%2Fjohnny_depp_gettyimages-869475490_1280.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-06%2Fjohnny_depp_vanessa_paradis_gettyimages-529488586.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-06%2Fvanessa_paradis_samuel_benchetrit_gettyimages-950509074.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2022-03/Billie_Lourd_GettyImages-1057181318_1920.jpg?h=b8626526&width=640"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/vanessa_paradis_samuel_benchetrit_gettyimages-950509074.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/vanessa-paradis-johnny-depps-ex-marries-director-samuel-benchetrit-105292", "title": "Vanessa Paradis, Johnny Depp's Ex, Marries Director Samuel Benchetrit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/vanessa_paradis_samuel_benchetrit_gettyimages-950509074.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 45-year-old French actress tied the knot with Benchetrit in France on Saturday.", "title": "Vanessa Paradis, Johnny Depp's Ex, Marries Director Samuel Benchetrit", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/vanessa-paradis-johnny-depps-ex-marries-director-samuel-benchetrit-105292", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 45-year-old French actress tied the knot with Benchetrit in France on Saturday.", "twitter": {"description": "The 45-year-old French actress tied the knot with Benchetrit in France on Saturday.", "title": "Vanessa Paradis, Johnny Depp's Ex, Marries Director Samuel Benchetrit", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/vanessa-paradis-johnny-depps-ex-marries-director-samuel-benchetrit-105292", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/vanessa_paradis_samuel_benchetrit_gettyimages-950509074.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Vanessa Paradis, Johnny Depp's Ex, Marries Director Samuel Benchetrit  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Weddings, Johnny Depp", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
