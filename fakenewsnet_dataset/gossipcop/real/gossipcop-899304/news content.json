We just had to evacuate our pets. I\u2019m praying for everyone in our community and thankful to all the incredible firefighters,\" the 59-year-old comedian wrote.\n\nIn the week since it erupted, CBS Los Angeles reports that the Thomas fire has burned over 200,000 acres and has left more than 85,000 people without power. At least 88,000 people have had to evacuate, including Lea Michele, Rob Lowe and Katy Perry's parents. The Witness singer tweeted, \"Saying a prayer for my hometown of Santa Barbara & Montecito tonight The #thomasfire is still only 10% contained after devastating #Ventura #Ojai & now #Carpinteria. Over 230,000 acres burned... Have many friends & now even my parents evacuate. My heart breaks for the 805.\"\n\n\"Praying for my town. Fires closing in. Firefighters making brave stands. Could go either way. Packing to evacuate now,\" Lowe tweeted on Sunday.\n\nOprah, who was out of the county until Sunday, has also evacuated from her Montecito, California, enclave, telling ET, \"just praying for the best for our little town.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-12%2Fgettyimages-887044106.jpg%3Fh%3D6b7011a3&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2Fkylie_jenner_gettyimages-671700060.jpg%3Fh%3Dd32be988&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/1280_ellen_portia_gettyimages-639642268.jpg?h=8f9cfe54", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-12%2F1280_evanrachelwood_jeffreywright_westworld_hbo.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/1280_ellen_portia_gettyimages-639642268.jpg?h=8f9cfe54", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/ellen-degeneres-and-portia-de-rossi-evacuate-california-home-amid-wildfire-threat-92469", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi Evacuate California Home Amid Wildfire Threat", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/1280_ellen_portia_gettyimages-639642268.jpg?h=8f9cfe54", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The TV host tweeted at fans that the couple and their dogs are OK as the devastating fires continue to take a toll on Southern California.", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi Evacuate California Home Amid Wildfire Threat", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/ellen-degeneres-and-portia-de-rossi-evacuate-california-home-amid-wildfire-threat-92469", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The TV host tweeted at fans that the couple and their dogs are OK as the devastating fires continue to take a toll on Southern California.", "twitter": {"description": "The TV host tweeted at fans that the couple and their dogs are OK as the devastating fires continue to take a toll on Southern California.", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi Evacuate California Home Amid Wildfire Threat", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/ellen-degeneres-and-portia-de-rossi-evacuate-california-home-amid-wildfire-threat-92469", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/1280_ellen_portia_gettyimages-639642268.jpg?h=8f9cfe54", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi Evacuate California Home Amid Wildfire Threat | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Ellen Degeneres, Portia De Rossi", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
