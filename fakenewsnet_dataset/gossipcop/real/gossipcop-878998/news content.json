Bert Rodriguez, who played piano during the performance, spoke with ET about how the mood boosting event came about.\n\n\"She [Kristen Bell] was gracious and funny. Very funny. We sat down and rehearsed the songs she was going to sing. She wasn't demanding or diva-ish in the slightest,\" he said of the actress, who contacted Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer to see how she could contribute to those threatened by the hurricane.\n\n\"She sang 'For The First Time In Forever', inviting up one of the evacuees to sing with her, as well as a local Orlando deputy to provide 'interpretive dance,'\" he added.\n\nBell shared a pic from the performance, joking she was getting upstaged by her dancers. \"When you're #singinginahurricane, your volunteer back up dancers can & will steal the show. Richard and Rebecca everyone! #hurricaneirma,\" she wrote on Instagram.\n\nRodriguez continued, \"She sang 'Do You Want To Build A Snowman'. And she sang a song that was cut from Frozen called 'More Than Just The Spare.' Then she took pictures and signed autographs for another half hour. She took time to ask people where they were from, if their homes were OK. She insisted on seeing the gym where everyone was sleeping on cots spread across the floor. Everyone was very tired and worried. But as she walked around and talked to people, inviting them to the auditorium to sing, people began to gain interest and perk up. She was so down to earth that the crowd warmed up and had fun as she started singing.\"\n\nMeadow Woods Middle School also shared some videos of the star performing, thanking her dance volunteers and encouraging the crowd. \"I hope that helped,\" Bell said to the group. \"And I hope that some of these songs are running through your head the rest of the day and take your mind off of it.\"\n\n\"Kristen said something like, 'That's why I wanted to come down here and sing. I may be stuck here in a hurricane, but I can still make a difference,'\" Rodriguez added.\n\nBack at her hotel, Bell also sat with senior citizen evacuees. She tweeted a picture writing, \"There are thousands of senior home evacuees in our hotel so...here's me dining with all my new friends! #Irma2017 #HurricaneIrma\"\n\nAnd the storm hasn't dampened her sense of humor. She tweeted a sweet video of herself singing \"You Are My Sunshine\" with one of the seniors, and teased her husband, Dax Shepard. \"Dear @daxshepard1, this is John. My side piece in Orlando,\" she wrote. \"I hope u understand. I'm powerless over a man who serenades me. #Irma2017.\"\n\nThis isn't the first help Bell has extended help during Hurricane Irma. Josh Gad shared on Instagram that the actress had helped his parents and family find shelter after they were stranded in Florida.\n\n\"So @kristenanniebell literally saved my parents and my entire family tonight from #hurricaneirma,\" he wrote, sharing a pic of his co-star with his happy and relieved parents.\n\n\"When they were stranded in Florida, she got them a hotel room at her hotel in Orlando and saved them, my brothers, my sister-in-law and niece and nephew,\" he continued. \"They don't make them like this girl. Thank you Kristin. You are truly an angel sent from above.\"\n\nThe 37-year-old also helped her pal Jennifer Carpenter's grandma and aunt find shelter. Carpenter tweeted, \"Gma&aunt were ready2 wear helmets N closet under eye of #HurricanIrma til @IMKristenBell found them a way out!!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\"\n\nHurricane Irma comes just after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, Texas, and surrounding areas. Since the storm receded, celebrities like Beyonc\u00e8, Jennifer Garner and Kevin Hart have been donating and giving back to the affected communities.\n\nSee who else has given back in the video below.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/1280_kristen_bell_getty_679726254.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-03%2Fkristen_bell_655849040.jpg%3Fh%3D90429f61&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/1280_kristen_bell_getty_679726254.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kristen-bell-performs-frozen-songs-hurricane-irma-shelter-continues-rescue-co-stars-families-86937", "title": "Kristen Bell Performs 'Frozen' Songs at Hurricane Irma Shelter, Continues to Rescue Co-Stars' Families", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/1280_kristen_bell_getty_679726254.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The star is helping keep spirits up for those trapped by the monster storm.", "title": "Kristen Bell Performs 'Frozen' Songs at Hurricane Irma Shelter, Continues to Rescue Co-Stars' Families", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kristen-bell-performs-frozen-songs-hurricane-irma-shelter-continues-rescue-co-stars-families-86937", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The star is helping keep spirits up for those trapped by the monster storm.", "twitter": {"description": "The star is helping keep spirits up for those trapped by the monster storm.", "title": "Kristen Bell Performs 'Frozen' Songs at Hurricane Irma Shelter, Continues to Rescue Co-Stars' Families", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kristen-bell-performs-frozen-songs-hurricane-irma-shelter-continues-rescue-co-stars-families-86937", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/1280_kristen_bell_getty_679726254.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Kristen Bell Performs 'Frozen' Songs at Hurricane Irma Shelter, Continues to Rescue Co-Stars' Families | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Kristen Bell", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 41, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
