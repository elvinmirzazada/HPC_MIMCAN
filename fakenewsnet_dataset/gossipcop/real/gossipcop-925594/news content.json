Fans seem to think Cardi is pulling a Kylie Jenner and concealing a pregnancy with her husband-to-be, Offset . Although it was just a rumor, one fan boldly questioned Cardi about her about an alleged bun in the oven and the rapper had quite the response.\n\nThe \u201cBartier Cardi\u201d rapper was just minding her business, posting videos on Instagram, when one of her fans posed the pregnancy question in her comments section. And of course, in true Cardi B fashion, she replied, \u201cNo b***h. I\u2019m just getting fat. Let me fat in peace.\u201d\n\nWhile no one likes to be asked about their sudden weight gain, Cardi might\u2019ve had it coming. During an interview with E! News on the red carpet at the 2018 Grammys, Cardi told her fans to blatantly ask her about anything they want to know rather than speculate and gossip. \"So it's just like, if y'all wanna know, ask me, I'll tell ya,\" she told Giuliana Rancic.\n\nSo, Cardi B and Offset may not have a baby on the way, but they are still planning to have a wedding sometime soon. The couple, who previously got engaged in Oct. 2018, said they were pushing the wedding back while they focus on their busy careers and schedules. But as they both tell it, a wedding is definitely going down.\n\nCheck out the video where Cardi addressed the pregnancy rumors below.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015im_/https://www.bet.com/music/2018/02/05/super-bowl-halftime-show-performer-predictions-vote-2019/_jcr_content/squareImage.trendingthumb.dimg/__1517868383751__1517867054762/020518-music-kendrick-lamar-Split.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=331289063738687&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015im_/https://www.bet.com/music/2018/02/05/t-i-trey-songz-responds-raven-symone-instagram-post/_jcr_content/squareImage.trendingthumb.dimg/__1517847681954__1517847419248/020518-music-Raven-Symone-Split.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015im_/https://www.bet.com/music/2018/02/05/nicki-minaj-fans-launch-finding-nicki-website/_jcr_content/squareImage.trendingthumb.dimg/__1517865384622__1517856505354/020518-music-nicki-minaj-performs.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035012&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1725845810983009&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015im_/https://www.bet.com/music/2018/02/05/cardi-b-pregnant-rumors-response-offset-baby/_jcr_content/image.custom1200x600.dimg/__1517863134598__1517861596922/020518-music-cardi-b.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015im_/https://www.bet.com/music/2018/02/05/cardi-b-pregnant-rumors-response-offset-baby/_jcr_content/image.custom1200x600.dimg/__1517863134598__1517861596922/020518-music-cardi-b.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Mckinney", "Written Jessica Mckinney"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015/https://www.bet.com/music/2018/02/05/cardi-b-pregnant-rumors-response-offset-baby.html", "title": "Cardi B's Response To Those Pregnancy Rumors Did Not Disappoint", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#ff005b", "title": "Cardi B's Response To Those Pregnancy Rumors Did Not Disappoint", "meta_title": "Cardi B's Response To Those Pregnancy Rumors Did Not Disappoint", "description": "Do Cardi B and Offset have a bun in the oven?", "fragment": "!", "label": "Music", "image": "/content/bet/music/2018/02/05/cardi-b-pregnant-rumors-response-offset-baby/_jcr_content/image.custom0x0.dimg/__1517863134598__1517861596922/020518-music-cardi-b.jpg", "category": "music", "keywords": "Cardi B, Offset", "date": "2018-02-05", "pubDate": "2018-02-05T20:50:48.050Z", "authorName": "Jessica McKinney", "robots": "index, follow, noydir, noodp", "google-site-verification": "kbRSzEgXdDDzZ6Clwv9bGHe_wBIxQdC1bS_suBV9W2I", "fb": {"app_id": 186402491400362, "admins": "100002101001291,100003672930544"}, "og": {"site_name": "BET.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015/https://www.bet.com/music/2018/02/05/cardi-b-pregnant-rumors-response-offset-baby.html?cid=facebook", "title": "Cardi B's Response To Those Pregnancy Rumors Did Not Disappoint", "description": "Do Cardi B and Offset have a bun in the oven?", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015im_/https://www.bet.com/music/2018/02/05/cardi-b-pregnant-rumors-response-offset-baby/_jcr_content/image.custom1200x600.dimg/__1517863134598__1517861596922/020518-music-cardi-b.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@BET", "id": 16560657}, "title": "Cardi B's Response To Those Pregnancy Rumors Did Not Disappoint", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015im_/https://www.bet.com/music/2018/02/05/cardi-b-pregnant-rumors-response-offset-baby.html?cid=twitter", "description": "Do Cardi B and Offset have a bun in the oven?", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180206031015im_/https://www.bet.com/music/2018/02/05/cardi-b-pregnant-rumors-response-offset-baby/_jcr_content/image.custom0x0.dimg/__1517863134598__1517861596922/020518-music-cardi-b.jpg", "creator": "@BET", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "mediatype": "newsArticle"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517781600.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
