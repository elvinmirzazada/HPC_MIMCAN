DCFS investigations are protocol in situations where child abuse has been alleged.\n\nIn August, Norma -.- who has been divorced from Tyrese since 2009 -- alleged in court documents that Tyrese hit and beat their daughter to the ground. Tyrese says the allegations are false.\n\nFollowing the news, Tyrese took to Instagram on Thursday to reveal he was taking a trip out of \"toxic\" Los Angeles following his recent meltdowns on social media.\n\n\"I hope and pray that all of this toxic bulls**t goes away soon,\" the 38-year-old actor wrote. \"I\u2019m a positive father aka person who loves to laugh and inspire - I\ufe0f have a gift and that\u2019s to connect to and with people.\"\n\nTyrese has since shared that he's in London, meditating and practicing yoga to deal with the turmoil in his life, which also includes a feud with his Fast costar Dwayne Johnson.\n\nET caught up with the actor on Thursday outside the courthouse where he got emotional over the custody battle over his 10-year-old daughter.\n\n\"They call me crazy, they said I'm having mental meltdowns on the internet -- I am,\" Tyrese told ET's Kevin Frazier. \"Because... you're judging me because you still get to go home to your daughter. I don't have my baby.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, if she doesn't wrap this up,\" he added, \"this nightmare's not gonna end, my baby's not home.\"\n\nWatch the video below for more.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/tyrese_vidpic_110217_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2Fdwayne_johnson_tyrese_gibson_gettyimages-468312898.jpg%3Fh%3D35f232b8&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fdwayne_johnson_tyrese_gettyimages-468305280.jpg%3Fh%3D0e3ca285&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2F1242911076001_4646230810001_et-tyrese-1204-lands_3.jpg&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/tyrese_vidpic_110217_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/tyrese-gibson-jets-out-toxic-la-child-abuse-investigation-dropped-90427", "title": "Tyrese Gibson Jets Out of 'Toxic' LA as Child Abuse Investigation Is Dropped", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/tyrese_vidpic_110217_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 'Fast & Furious' star previously made an emotional plea to his ex-wife on Instagram to not 'take my baby.'", "title": "Tyrese Gibson Jets Out of 'Toxic' LA as Child Abuse Investigation Is Dropped", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tyrese-gibson-jets-out-toxic-la-child-abuse-investigation-dropped-90427", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 'Fast & Furious' star previously made an emotional plea to his ex-wife on Instagram to not 'take my baby.'", "twitter": {"description": "The 'Fast & Furious' star previously made an emotional plea to his ex-wife on Instagram to not 'take my baby.'", "title": "Tyrese Gibson Jets Out of 'Toxic' LA as Child Abuse Investigation Is Dropped", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tyrese-gibson-jets-out-toxic-la-child-abuse-investigation-dropped-90427", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/tyrese_vidpic_110217_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Tyrese Gibson Jets Out of 'Toxic' LA as Child Abuse Investigation Is Dropped | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, Movies, Tyrese Gibson", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
