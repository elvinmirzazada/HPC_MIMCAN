It might take time to get a divorce and I\u2019m going to always have a lot of love for him because he is my daughter\u2019s father,\u201d Cardi concluded.\n\nOffset responded to Cardi\u2019s video writing, \u201cY\u2019all won\u201d in the comment section.\n\nThe former couple, who revealed they secretly tied the knot in September 2017, welcomed Kulture on July 10. Kulture is the fourth child for the Migos rapper, who has three children from previous relationships.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

First, the obvious: Kiari, a direct nod to Offset\u2019s legal name of Kiari Kendrell Cephus (the duo even have the same initials!).\n\nFans immediately made the connection between the newborn\u2019s first name, Kulture, and Migos\u2019 recent discography. The hip-hop group\u2019s latest two albums are called Culture and Culture II.\n\nCardi B and Offset.

The tune includes the lyric, \u201cHigher we go, beg and plead for the culture.\u201d\n\nThe new mom also tweeted, \u201cKulture! Anything else woulda been basic.\u201d\n\nJeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\nCardi previously revealed that Offset was the mastermind behind their baby\u2019s moniker, telling Ellen DeGeneres in April, \u201cMy dude named the baby. I really like the name.\u201d\n\nWhen the talk-show host pressed for details, Cardi said she was leaving further comment up to her beau, explaining, \u201cI\u2019m gonna let him say the name since he named the baby.\u201d\n\nCardi has yet to further address her split from Offset and representatives for Cardi and Offset did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/_VGoZiElocv1gS5P_04gS1Df1cY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/cardi-b-offset-kids-a19f8c8893b84c1b8f482b9ecf622c6d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/QJ3SNmeMGN5eTQy3Ksqoq5O1kXM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(427x51:429x53)/cardib_3-e7024e63eb604bc19971880ec93695c5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/TfCNd0LxGql7CR9S_9uNi3EPoNo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(425x0:427x2)/Cardi-B-Thanksgiving-2022-02-112522-52281d569dfc4b21a676612b2c01c307.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/E0ysIkR3Cpbl43-cKox3QXwDt2Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x199:736x201)/cardi-b-son-wave-021423-tout-51d0d27c941a4747831e48d6ea1558d0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9n6zBEtKGrnT5iHHct3QQRxy0wo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/cardi-b-86b0b54efac54accaf3ac015056fd911.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/OB8X-oAahH23IyVAjx146-ppVT0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/cardi-b-wave-030223-3-0d7b65a8c5af42fa8eaf0156f2f43a9b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/iXmYMHvwbOB9lj9d4IvC3yZowI0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x139:751x141)/cardi-b-122522-split-b31d7d053a4c45d28f4b525f1ef2f970.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lZbcf3kzUJloMnDhlrvJuwnZG_w=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(441x150:443x152)/cardi-b-kulture-111622-4-d7b0244940d74a3191022dac523ee6c7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4mRRD0HayecreVkiRJEsIVB_vbo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(726x0:728x2)/cardi-b-ffd24b8d9fb0462e844e4a8f6e8ea7ea.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/j6VTyYJMhBjdDEj-Zl3-6eTE5b8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Cardi-B-Shares-Sweet-Moments-with-Son-Wave-after-Breastfeeding-112922-1-e52566ec311743c381baf66b9f40589e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/RTJvQC0FriThpbaV6UJcKPNpK60=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/cardi-b-offset-kid-030923-48948bc0cf644f00bad1c9313b99114d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Kh5JvHYa6LVaO47KfwijsF0wl-c=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(782x269:784x271)/cardi-b-kulture-2455cb41f78c484ba7360fefc5fa7e41.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HUjTbxZYWoFJ2844jByjngfBXPQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(415x0:417x2)/cardi-b32-7a82ef1db2474da99a4b487bc088d42b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ELNjG6X_6jfR3xzQYqeRBvmjDDI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(587x231:589x233)/cardi-b-kids-022123-4ffee139bb074c03a891431f0148b5e8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7s_B4HNnqaaFHCZP3wVQjQEsres=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x9:766x11)/cardi-b-kids-sick-new-030723-d7dda98aefd14482bd251804ca6971d4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/cjCHTprTdESrxXi-QQbdxC9a1Z0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(478x419:480x421)/offset-baby-wave-2-cf4f03e8e6de40028e7cd8bdc399729f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/g_gqZmiSERH7QsAZ_XGJx6ha5lQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/cardi-c-7dfd19d78b8347bcbad0725ba102b588.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9BtyMRXTlY3CxglwlyxbH-iL-yE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/cardi-b9-8ea6f24257b04172a5fe3f5f4e90851a.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/9BtyMRXTlY3CxglwlyxbH-iL-yE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/cardi-b9-8ea6f24257b04172a5fe3f5f4e90851a.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi", "Robyn Merrett Is A Former Associate Morning News Editor At People.
