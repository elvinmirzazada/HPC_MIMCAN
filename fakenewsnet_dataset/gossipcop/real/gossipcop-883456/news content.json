Vikander and Fassbender exchanged vows at the luxurious La Granja farmstead resort surrounded by friends and family, sources previously told PEOPLE.\n\nKarwai Tang/WireImage\n\nThe star of the upcoming Tomb Raider reboot went on to admit that the pair \u2014 who met in late 2014 while filming The Light Between Oceans \u2014 might even consider working together again under the right circumstances.\n\n\"We had a great experience, apart from the fact that we\u2026,\" Vikander told Vogue before glancing down at her wedding ring with a laugh.\n\nAfter calling her husband \"one of the absolute best actors I've worked with,\" the Academy Award-winning actress explained how even though he had more experience than she did when they began filming the movie, he never looked down on her and even asked her for advice on his character.\n\n\"Of course he'd done more films than me, but immediately when we started to work together he was so open to wanting me to chip in new ideas and thoughts,\" she continued. \"He would be like, 'I'm stuck; what should I do?' and I would say, 'You're asking me?' That was such a sweet thing.\"\n\n\"Life is about a lot more than work, but if it's also your biggest passion, of course it's something you enjoy talking about,\" she added.\n\nDreamworks/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock\n\nFollowing Vikander and Fassbender's under-the-radar wedding, the pair honeymooned in Italy.\n\nThe couple was also spotted touring Verona and Florence, where they stopped to take a few photos with fans.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Alicia Vikander is White Hot During Brazilian Vacation\n\nThe newlyweds made their public debut as a couple at the 2016 Golden

The Light Between Oceans, they spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the importance of keeping their relationship private. \"I think we've made a clear statement that we keep certain things just between us,\" Vikander said. \"It was very easy to unite, but that's quite personal.\"", "images":
