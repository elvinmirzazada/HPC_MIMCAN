We\u2019re supposed to use whatever time we\u2019re given to shine a light on other stories. There are so many stories that we are not covering and to take time with this is not journalism.\u201d\n\nRelated: Talk Show Controversies and Feuds: The Biggest Ever Take a look at some of the biggest controversies and feuds in talk show history, from Star Jones' falling-out with Barbara Walters on The View, to Matt Lauer and Ann Curry's Today show drama, to David Letterman's sex scandal and extortion plot\n\nWhoopi Goldberg went on to reference a statement Kelly made about Santa Claus\u2019 ethnicity on Fox News in 2013. \u201cIf I can forgive you for telling all of my friends\u2019 black children that Santa\u2019s only white, then you can step back,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cWe all make mistakes. You gotta lighten up babe. Jane made a mistake.\u201d (Fonda has repeatedly apologized through the years for her visit to Hanoi.)\n\nBut a Kelly insider suspects Behar and Goldberg are just bitter. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise The View is using Megyn to try to make themselves more relevant, since she has been regularly beating them for the past 2 months,\u201d the insider tells Us Weekly.\n\nThank You!

Kanye West vs. Wiz Khalifa, Donald Trump vs. Megyn Kelly, George Clooney vs. Russell Crowe and many more: Take a look back at some of Hollywood's ugliest feuds of all time!\n\nKelly stated on Monday that Fonda has \u201cdiscussed her cosmetic surgery pretty much everywhere before coming on our show,\u201d noting the Oscar winner\u2019s previous interviews with Entertainment Tonight, W magazine and other outlets. \u201cApparently when she came here, however . . . I was supposed to discern that this subject was suddenly off-limits,\u201d the NBC News host quipped.\n\n\u201cThis is a woman whose name is synonymous with outrage,\u201d Kelly continued. \u201cLook at her treatment our of military during the Vietnam War. Most of our veterans still call her \u2018Hanoi Jane\u2019 thanks to her radio broadcasts, which attempted to shame American troops. She posed on an anti-aircraft gun used to shoot down our pilots . . . So, the moral indignation is a little much.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ben-Affleck-and-Jennifer-Garners-Boyfriend-John-Miller-Have-a-\u2018Mutual-Respect-for-Each-Other-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1998px%2C1131px&resize=600%2C338&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-view-slams-megyn-kelly-for-jane-fonda-comments.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-view-slams-megyn-kelly-for-jane-fonda-comments.jpg?w=1000&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/a360media-logo-color.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AmazonIsh.png?crop=35px%2C0px%2C1281px%2C1281px&resize=300%2C300&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-view-slams-megyn-kelly-for-jane-fonda-comments.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/the-view-blasts-megyn-kelly-for-jane-fonda-comments/", "title": "\u2018The View\u2019 Blasts Megyn Kelly for Jane Fonda Comments", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "ahrefs-site-verification": "0c593552a61f5d2f07d12f3629456cc24366510fb83bd76eb9504919faac5af7", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "\u2018The View\u2019 cohosts blasted Megyn Kelly for her controversial comments about Jane Fonda \u2014 find out what they said", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018The View\u2019 Blasts Megyn Kelly for Jane Fonda Comments", "description": "\u2018The View\u2019 cohosts blasted Megyn Kelly for her controversial comments about Jane Fonda \u2014 find out what they said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/the-view-blasts-megyn-kelly-for-jane-fonda-comments/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-01-23T20:13:42+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-view-slams-megyn-kelly-for-jane-fonda-comments.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-view-slams-megyn-kelly-for-jane-fonda-comments.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-01-23T18:56:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-23T20:13:42+00:00"}, "author": "Rachel Paula Abrahamson", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018The View\u2019 Blasts Megyn Kelly for Jane Fonda Comments", "description": "\u2018The View\u2019 cohosts blasted Megyn Kelly for her controversial comments about Jane Fonda \u2014 find out what they said", "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-view-slams-megyn-kelly-for-jane-fonda-comments.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@rachelpaula", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.3.2", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-23 13:56:52", "sailthru.title": "\u2018The View\u2019 Blasts Megyn Kelly for Jane Fonda Comments", "sailthru.tags": ",Celebrity News,Ann Curry,business and finance,celebrity relationships,celebrity scandal,censorship and freedom of speech,economic sector,economy,fundamental rights,Jane Fonda,Joy Behar,media,Megyn Kelly,politics,pop culture,Whoopi Goldberg", "sailthru.author": "Rachel Paula Abrahamson", "sailthru.description": "Megyn Kelly has been a hot topic this week \u2014 so it\u2019s only natural that her name came up on the Tuesday, January 23, episode of The View.
