Truth be told, and this is crazy, but I\u2019ve always wanted twins. Finding out that I was having them was one of the most amazing moments of my life. They\u2019ll have a built-in bestie for life.\n\nUs: Were you secretly hoping for a specific gender?\n\nVG: Honestly, I wanted girls. I thought they were boys until I started picking out nurseries.

My first trimester was really difficult because I had no appetite at all.\n\nUs: Why is it high risk?\n\nVG: The twins are monochorionic diamniotic. They share a placenta, which means they also share nutrients. One baby can potentially take more from the other, so I have monitoring every two weeks. The moment doctors see one growing bigger, there\u2019s a surgery they can do.\n\nUs: Any strange cravings?\n\nVG: Peaches and pickled eggs. It\u2019s a redneck thing! And Coca-Cola from the glass bottle. That sounds picky, but it tastes so good.\n\nRelated: Celeb Moms and Their Pregnancy Cravings Mila Kunis, Jessica Simpson, Kourtney Kardashian and other famous moms reveal their craziest pregnancy cravings \u2014 from chicken noodle soup to Cap\u2019N Crunch, find out what celebrities can\u2019t get enough of when they\u2019re expecting\n\nUs: Most surprising aspect of pregnancy?\n\nVG: I have to pee a lot.

Isn\u2019t the best part of having twins dressing them in matching clothes?\n\nUs: Who are you leaning on for advice and support?\n\nVG: Three of my cousins and two of my best friends are pregnant right now. It\u2019s nice because our kids are going to grow up together \u2014 and I get maternity clothes passed down. My mom is going to live with me for the first two months to help with the babies.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Parents Who Have Twins From Neil Patrick Harris to Angelina Jolie and now Beyonce, scroll down to see more stars who are mom and dad to twin kids\n\nUs: What would you say if your girls asked to go on The Bachelor?\n\nVG: If you\u2019re doing it for fun and to travel and meet incredible people, go for it.
