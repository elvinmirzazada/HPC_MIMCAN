In exchange for the plea, the DUI charge was dismissed, and the actor received two years of probation.\n\nThe actor must also attend either 26 Narcotics Anonymous sessions, or a 12-hour class.\n\nCutkosky\u2019s attorney, Troy Slaten, told TheWrap, \u201cI think it was a good, fair result,\u201d noting that any allegation involving alcohol or drugs against his client was \u201ccompletely dismissed.\u201d\n\nCutkosky was arrested on Nov. 2, after being stopped just after 10:30 p.m. by officers of the Burbank, Calif., police department for unsafe speed, an unsafe turning movement and lane straddling. Police told TheWrap that officers noticed \u201cthe distinct odor of burnt marijuana\u201d on the 18-year-old actor, who told police that he had smoked weed earlier that evening.\n\nCutkosky was subsequently arrested on suspicion of DUI, drugs.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ethan-cutkosky.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bob-Hearts-Abishola.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ethan-cutkosky.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Untitled-design-5-1.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Neil-Gaiman.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/David-Zaslav.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ethan-cutkosky.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tim Kenneally", "Kayla Cobb", "Lucas Manfredi", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/shameless-star-ethan-cutkosky-reaches-plea-deal-in-dui-case/", "title": "\u2018Shameless\u2019 Star Ethan Cutkosky Reaches Plea Deal in DUI Case", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Shameless' Star Ethan Cutkosky Reaches Plea Deal in DUI Case - TheWrap", "description": "Actor on Showtime series receives two years of probation after pleading to reckless driving", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/shameless-star-ethan-cutkosky-reaches-plea-deal-in-dui-case/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ethan-cutkosky.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "published_time": "2018-01-11T23:46:49+00:00"}, "author": "Tim Kenneally", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Tim Kenneally", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "\u2018Shameless\u2019 Star Ethan Cutkosky Reaches Plea Deal in DUI Case", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/shameless-star-ethan-cutkosky-reaches-plea-deal-in-dui-case/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-01-11T15:46:49-08:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Tim Kenneally", "parsely-tags": "ethan-cutkosky, ethan-cutkosky-arrest, shameless, showtime", "article-tags": "ethan-cutkosky, ethan-cutkosky-arrest, shameless, showtime}", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "crime-2, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515714409.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
