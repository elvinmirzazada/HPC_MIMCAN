One of her classmates and friends there was the late rap artist Tupac Shakur. He wrote poems about her, and she later had a cameo in his music video for \u201cStrictly 4 My Niggaz.\u201d Pinkett graduated high school in 1989 then spent a year at the North Carolina School of the Arts.\n\nOf her relationship with Tupac, Pinkett Smith later told reporters that she was a drug dealer when she met Shakur and that she resented the way the movie (2017) later \u201creimagined\u201d their relationship: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about, oh, you have this cute girl, and this cool guy, they must have been in this\u2014nah, it wasn\u2019t that at all. It was about survival, and it had always been about survival between us.\u201d\n\n\n\nTV Shows and Early Movies\n\nJada Pinkett as Lena James on the television series A Different World Getty Images\n\nPinkett began her acting career with an appearance on sitcom True Colors in 1990. She appeared in guest roles on other television shows like Doogie Howser, M.D. and 21 Jump Street before earning her first recurring role on the NBC comedy A Different World, created by Bill Cosby as a spinoff of The Cosby Show. Portraying sassy college student Lena James, Pinkett joined the show during its fifth season in 1992 and remained on the series until its conclusion the following year. Series producer and director Debbie Allen wrote the part specifically for Pinkett, and Allen said the actor \u201cwalked in ready\u201d after she was cast.\n\nHer first movie role was portraying a young single mother named Ronnie in Menace II Society (1993). She was cast based upon a suggestion by Tupac, who was originally slated to appear in the film but was fired from the project shortly after Pinkett was cast. She considered quitting the job as as result, but Tupac convinced her to keep the part, and she later said, \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have done it without his blessing.\u201d She received critical acclaim for the performance, with film critic Roger Ebert describing her performance as \u201cfilled with life and conviction.\u201d\n\nPinkett continued to earn positive reviews for her movie performances in 1994. She appeared in the action comedy A Low Down Dirty Shame alongside Keenen Ivory Wayan, a performance Stephen Holden of The New York Times called \u201cas sassy and sizzling as a Salt-n-Pepa recording,\u201d adding that \u201cshe walks away with the movie.\u201d She also starred in a more dramatic leading role alongs ide Allen Payne in the erotic drama Jason\u2019s Lyric. Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle wrote that Pinkett had a \u201cpowerful screen presence\u201d and said her scenes with Payne \u201cseem like something out of Romeo and Juliet.\u201d\n\nPinkett had additional featured roles in films like 1995\u2019s Demon Knight and Set it Off the next year. Also in 1995, she began directing music videos, including \u201cKeep On, Keepin\u2019 On\u201d by MC Lyte. She conceived the idea for the music video for Tupac\u2019s hit song \u201cCalifornia Love,\u201d which features the rapper fighting an evil tribal chief in a desert set in the year 2095. The idea was inspired by the 1985 film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and Pinkett was originally slated to direct it, but she dropped out of the project, according to the book .\n\n\n\nRise to Big-Screen Stardom: Matrix and Madagascar Movies\n\nIn 1996, Pinkett portrayed Eddie Murphy\u2019s love interest in The Nutty Professor; the comedy earned $274 million worldwide. She also appeared in Set It Off (1996), Scream 2 (1997), Return to Paradise (1998), Woo (1998),and Spike Lee\u2019s highly controversial Bamboozled (2000), a satire of racial bias in the television industry. The following year, she joined her husband, Will Smith, in the biopic Ali, in which she played boxing great Muhammad Ali\u2019s first wife, Sonji. She was initially hesitate to appear in the movie because she feared her real-life marriage to Smith would be a distraction to viewers, saying it might \u201ctake people out of the movie.\u201d She, nevertheless, auditioned and took the role at the insistence of director Michael Mann.\n\nThe Matrix Revolutions co-stars Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Keanu Reeves, and Jada Pinkett Smith Getty Images\n\nPinkett Smith established arguably her most well-known role when she portrayed the human rebel Niobe in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, directed by the Wachowskis and both released in 2003. Prior to her own role in the science-fiction action franchise, she urged her husband to take the lead role of Neo in the first film from 1999. Will turned it down, and the part ultimately went to Keanu Reeves. Pinkett Smith originally auditioned for the female lead of Trinity, which went to Carrie-Anne Moss, but the Wackowskis wrote the character of Niobe specifically for Pinkett Smith in the sequels. In addition to the movies, Pinkett Smith played a leading role in the popular 2003 video game from the franchise called Enter the Matrix.\n\nContinuing to appear in commercially and critically successful films, Pinkett Smith had a role in Collateral (2004), starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx, and directed by Michael Mann. The next year, she voiced the character of Gloria the hippopotamus for Madagascar (2005), which went on to earn $532 million worldwide. Tom McGrath, one of the directors of the film, said Pinkett Smith had the \u201cconfidence and sweetness\u201d they were seeking for the character. She went on to reprise the character in five Madagascar sequels.\n\nShe co-starred in the dramas Reign Over Me (2007), with Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle, and The Women (2008) with Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Eva Mendes, and Debra Messing. The Women was panned by critics and Pinkett Smith and her three co-stars were collectively nominated for Worst Actress by the Golden Raspberry Awards, better known as the Razzies.\n\nAlso in 2008, Pinkett Smith made her debut as a director and writer in the independent feature The Human Contract, about a successful but unhappy businessman who falls in love with a free-spirited stranger. She co-starred in the film, which also featured Jason Clarke, Paz Vega, and Idris Elba.\n\nReturning to TV, she starred in and co-produced the TNT series Hawthorne, playing the chief nursing officer in a Richmond, Virginia hospital from 2009 to 2011.

The show sought to delve into issues that had affected her family, from differing generational viewpoints. \u201cMy mother is old school, Willow is new school, and I find myself right in the middle,\u201d she said.\n\nRed Table Talk proved to be a headline-grabber thanks to Pinkett Smith\u2019s willingness to share all kinds of personal information, including her admissions that she had undergone multiple vaginal rejuvenation treatments and that she was once addicted to using sex toys. The series, which won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Informative, ran five seasons through April 2023, when it was cancelled by Facebook Watch.\n\nMarriage to Will Smith and Affair\n\nJada Pinkett Smith with her family\u2014daughter Willow, husband Will Smith, son Jaden, and stepson Trey\u2014after the 94th Academy Awards in 2022. Getty Images\n\nJada Pinkett and Will Smith were married on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1997. The two met on the set of Smith\u2019s television series The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, where Pinkett Smith auditioned for the role of one of Smith\u2019s girlfriends. She lost the part to actor Nia Long because she was considered too short.\n\nTheir son, Jaden Smith, was born in 1998. Their daughter, Willow, was born in October 2000.

Smith confirmed in 2021 that he and Pinkett Smith have an open marriage. \u201cJada never believed in conventional marriage,\u201d he told GQ. \u201cWe have given each other trust and freedom, with the belief that everybody has to find their own way. And marriage for us can\u2019t be a prison.\u201d\n\nIn October 2023, Pinkett Smith sat for an interview with NBC\u2019s Hoda Kotb to discuss the star\u2019s new memoir Worthy, which includes the groundbreaking news that Jada and Will have lived separately for years. They separated in 2016 but continue to make public appearances together. Jada said many things contributed to the split. \u201cBy the time we got to 2016, we were just exhausted with trying,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we were both kind of just still stuck in our fantasy of what we thought the other person should be.\u201d She considered getting a divorce but hasn\u2019t gone through with it. Kotb said on the Today show that the couple has no plans to do so. \u201cI made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce,\u201d Jada said. \u201cWe will work through whatever. I just haven\u2019t been able to break that promise.\u201d\n\nHair Loss from Alopecia Diagnosis\n\nIn 2018, Pinkett publicly revealed that she has alopecia areata, a condition that results in the loss of hair in some or all parts of the body. \u201cI was in the shower one day and had just handfuls of hair in my hands and I was just like, \u2018Oh my god, am I going bald?\u2019\u201d she said on her show Red Table Talk, adding \u201cIt was one of those times in my life where I was literally shaking in fear. That\u2019s why I cut my hair and why I continue to cut it.\u201d\n\nPinkett Smith has said stress might be a factor in her illness. She began shaving her head as a result of her alopecia, saying in 2021: \u201cMama\u2019s gonna have to take it down to the scalp so nobody thinks she got brain surgery or something. Me and this alopecia are going to be friends\u2026 period.\u201d\n\nChris Rock Slap Incident\n\nWill Smith slapping Chris Rock during the 94th Academy Awards ceremony on March 27, 2022. Getty Images\n\nIn 2022, Pinkett Smith was involved with what has been described as one of the most infamous moments in pop culture history when her husband, Will Smith, slapped comedian Chris Rock during the 94th Academy Awards ceremony. Rock was presenting the award for Best Documentary Feature when he saw the couple in the audience and ad-libbed a joke about Pinkett Smith starring in a sequel G.I. Jane, due to her shaved head.\n\nPinkett Smith was visibly annoyed by the joke. Despite initially laughing at the joke himself, Smith walked onto the stage, slapped Rock across the face, then sat back down, and yelled at Rock from his seat. Rock appeared stunned, jokingly calling it the \u201cgreatest night in the history of television,\u201d before continuing his presentation. The moment, which became known as \u201cThe Slap\u201d and \u201cSlapgate,\u201d largely overshadowed the rest of the ceremony, during which Smith later won Best Actor for his role in King Richard.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmith later resigned from the Academy, which condemned his actions and banned him from future ceremonies for 10 years. Smith and Rock were both praised and defended from varying parties, with some criticizing Rock for mocking Pinkett Smith\u2019s medical condition. Pinkett Smith later said of the incident: \u201cMy deepest hope is that these two intelligent, capable men have the opportunity to heal, talk this out, and reconcile... The state of the world today? We need \u2019em both.\u201d\n\nIn her memoir, Pinkett Smith describes initially thinking the slap was a skit, and she told The New York Times she was surprised to hear Will call her his wife. \u201cEven though we hadn\u2019t been calling each other husband and wife in a long time, I said, \u2018I\u2019m his wife now. We in this.\u2019 That\u2019s just who I am,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the gift I have to offer, like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m riding with you.\u2019\u201d\n\nNet Worth\n\nPinkett Smith is reported to have a net worth of $50 million. This is the result of her work as an actor, producer, director, author, and businesswoman, as well as her marriage to Will Smith, who has been one of Hollywood\u2019s highest-paid actors of the last two decades, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nWorthy Memoir\n\nPinkett Smith released , her \u201cno holds barred\u201d recounting of her life on October 17, 2023. The actor gave some insight to her memoir\u2019s name prior to its release in an Instagram post, writing, \u201cMy hope is that through the exploration of my own tumultuous situations to the rediscovery of deep love, that we are all reminded that no matter where we may be on our journey, we are all...Worthy.\u201d\n\nLess than a week before the book release, Pinkett Smith gave readers a sneak preview of one of the book\u2019s most titillating topics: her relationship with Will Smith. She reveals in the book for the first time that she and Will have been separated since 2016.\n\nPinkett Smith also opens up about her depression and how she considered suicide, particularly after her 40th birthday. \u201cI\u2019d begun to think about how to have a fatal accident that wouldn\u2019t look intentional\u2014for the sake of my kids,\u201d she writes in the book. Instead, she heard about someone\u2019s experience with the psychedelic drug ayahuasca and found it helped her, too. \u201cIt gave me a new intimate relationship with myself that I had never had before,\u201d Pinkett Smith told People. \u201cThe suicidal thoughts completely went away.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or self-harming behaviors, call or text 988 to get help from the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.\n\nFact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
