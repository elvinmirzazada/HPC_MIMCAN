Intriguing.\n\nPicking up where \u201cWhat Comes After\u201d left off, Sunday\u2019s episode of The Walking Dead began fleshing out the five newbies that Judith rescued, made clear that take-no-prisoners Carol was alive and kicking (ass), revealed the legs of a love triangle in the making, unveiled several new hairdos and \u2014 at long last! \u2014 gave us our first taste of the Whisperers. Was it enough to make you want to come back for seconds? First let\u2019s review the goings-on in \u201cWho Are You Now?\u201d then you can hit the comments with your thoughts on \u201cWhat the Show Is Now.\u201d\n\n\u2018I HAVEN\u2019T GIVEN UP, AND I NEVER WILL\u2019 | As the plus-sized installment began, Michonne, sporting a slick, half-shaved new \u2019do, was having one of those heart-to-hearts with Rick in her head that we all have with our lost loved ones. \u201cI know you\u2019re here,\u201d she said, unaware of how right she was, thanks to Anne. \u201cI\u2019m still here, too. But it hasn\u2019t gotten any easier.\u201d If anything, \u201cthe path ahead has only grown darker.\u201d Yet she \u2014 everyone \u2014 clung to the little things\u2026 like a toy cowboy that resembled Rick, like the bird Daryl watched pluck a worm from a walker\u2019s ear to feed its babies, like the flower Carol spotted blooming in concrete. And maybe most importantly, Michonne kept dreaming. From there, we returned to the woods where Rosita, Eugene, Aaron and others were searching frantically for Judith. When they found her with Yumiko, Magna, Connie, Kelly and Luke \u2014 and the herd not far behind \u2014 Eugene gave us a sense of how much things had changed over the course of the time jump by turning into an impressive walker-killing machine. Despite his heroics, they still had to beat a hasty retreat. Though bringing along the newbies would break mom Michonne\u2019s security protocol, Judith put her little foot down. \u201cIf they don\u2019t go,\u201d she declared, \u201cI don\u2019t go.\u201d So back to Alexandria, they all went.\n\n\u2018THIS IS ALEXANDRIA\u2026 THIS IS HOME\u2019 | Once the group reached Alexandria, Judith \u2014 definitely her brother\u2019s sister \u2014 reassured the strangers that they\u2019d be safe there. \u201cPromise,\u201d she added, taking Magna\u2019s hand. However, once Michonne caught wind of the new arrivals, she didn\u2019t exactly roll out the welcome mat. Though she allowed Yumiko to be taken to the infirmary so that Siddiq could treat her head injury, the rest of the group would have to spend the night in holding before going before the council the following morning for a vote to decide their fate. Come judgment day, the group (except for a recuperating Miko) introduced themselves as follows to the council, which was made up of Gabriel, Michonne, Aaron, Laura, Siddiq, Nora and some guy I swear we\u2019ve never seen: Magna had been a truck-stop waitress who\u2019d become a fighter; Luke had been a music teacher and still considered himself one (since \u201ceducation never ends, even in the face of monsters and mayhem\u201d); hearing-impaired Connie had been a top-notch journalist who now thought of herself as sister Kelly\u2019s guardian angel; and Kelly had been a high-school kid who, since the rise of the dead, had had to grow up. That all sounded very nice. And the community, Michonne said, wanted to be generous. However\u2026 uh-oh.\n\n\u2018THERE\u2019S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING\u2019 | Michonne then asked to see Magna\u2019s left hand. Turned out, she was sporting a prison tattoo, one that told Michonne she\u2019d done hard time. And it got worse. Though Magna\u2019s group had appeared to lay down their arms before entering Alexandria, Michonne, really living up to her chief-of-security title, called out the ex-con for carrying a concealed weapon (a knife in her belt). Now Gabriel could go ahead and take a vote on the group\u2019s fate, Michonne said, somehow not adding, \u201cThe prosecution rests.\u201d Before Michonne stalked out of the assembly, Magna called after her. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d Without breaking her stride, Michonne shot back simply, \u201cNo.\u201d Later, we discovered that a) Gabriel had enough radio equipment to start WKRP in Alexandria, and b) he had become romantically involved with Rosita. (WTH? First Anne, now Rosita \u2014 the preacher gets more action than Daryl!) The couple were convinced they could reach more lovable newcomers like Magna\u2019s pals if only their signal could be boosted by a remote amplifier. Though they knew Michonne would object, and in a big way, Rosita still elected to go out a ways and install the amplifier \u2014 with, as her accomplice and technical adviser, a smitten Eugene!\n\n\u2018THIS WORLD COULD USE A FEW MORE DREAMERS\u2019 | Meanwhile, in the Kingdom, Carol, her hair now long and white, marveled at the state of the community. \u201cIs there any part of this place that\u2019s not falling apart?\u201d she asked Jerry (rhetorically). \u201cOur loyalty to you, my queen,\u201d he replied, jovial as ever and delighting in teasing her as the wife of the king and mother of prince Henry. Speaking of whom, the resourceful, now-older boy was quick to fix a busted pipe on the boiler (?) that nearly overheated disastrously. But he was well aware that a Band-Aid was no longterm solution. \u201cDad,\u201d he griped to Ezekiel, \u201cwe\u2019re holding things together with plastic and tape.\u201d They needed better tools and someone who really knew how to use them. That someone could be Henry \u2014 if the king would allow him to go study under Earl at the Hilltop. Unfortunately, Ezekiel didn\u2019t want him trained so much as \u201cI want him safe.\u201d Besides, the big fair that he hoped would reunite the communities was just around the corner. Oh, and another thing. \u201cHilltop feels so distant,\u201d he added. And it had ever since they\u2019d lost the glue that had held together the communities (Rick). Still, Carol was very much in favor of them loosening the reins on Henry, at least enough to let him become a cleverer engineer.\n\n\u2018HEY THERE, BOSS LADY\u2019 | Next thing we knew, Carol was escorting her son to the Hilltop\u2026 but taking the scenic route (even Henry could tell that they\u2019d missed their turnoff). Shortly, they heard a woman screaming for help, and without a second thought, off ran Henry\u2026 straight into a trap set by Regina, Jed and the remains of the Saviors. Since the Sanctuary had fallen, the baddies were in dire straits. So they\u2019d be taking all of the goodies that Carol and Henry had been bringing to the Hilltop. (Being as vile as they are, let\u2019s be real \u2014 they\u2019d have taken the goodies regardless!) At least, since Carol had once spared Jed, he\u2019d leave them with a pulse. Oh, but he did want her sparkly engagement ring. Ezekiel\u2019s missus readily handed it over, but Henry couldn\u2019t bear to see it on Jed\u2019s finger, and attacked. To no avail, mind you. But he tried. \u201cI meant to tell ya,\u201d Jed cracked to Carol before departing, \u201cI really like what you\u2019ve done to your hair.\u201d That night, after Henry expressed his shock that his mom just gave in like that, she stole away secretly and surrounded the sleeping Saviors with gas. Jed woke up at the last second and, terrified, swore she\u2019d never see them again. \u201cI know,\u201d she replied, setting the lot of \u2019em on fire! The following day, Henry apologized for his harsh words toward Carol and learned where their detour was taking them: to pick up Daryl. \u201cNeed a ride, stranger?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u2018IT DOESN\u2019T MATTER IF YOU\u2019RE A GOOD OR BAD PERSON ON THE INSIDE, THE NUMBERS DON\u2019T CARE\u2019 | Back in Alexandria, Judith did her homework within earshot of Negan, his spirits much raised since last we saw him. But he wasn\u2019t interested in helping her with theoretical math problems about two planes traveling toward one another, he wanted to help with something real. When Judith told him that a real problem was the fact that her mom was going to make the newcomers leave, he related the story of how, as a boy, he used to drive his mom crazy by bringing home stray dogs all the time, till one of them, which had seemed as sweet as the rest, had killed all of his other rescues. After that, he didn\u2019t bring home any more, he concluded. He wised up. \u201cYeah,\u201d retorted Judith, a definite contender for TV\u2019s cutest, most precocious kid, \u201cand look how great everything turned out for you.\u201d That night, as Magna was scolded by her friends for rocking the vote against them, she argued that she\u2019d only kept the knife because \u201cI wanted us to have options.\u201d As Luke noted, at that very moment, she was wearing yet another option: Yumiko\u2019s knife-concealing necklace! Though leaving likely meant that they would soon perish, \u201cif that\u2019s our fate,\u201d Connie argued, \u201cso be it.\u201d They weren\u2019t going to do battle with a community that had kids in it.\n\n\u2018YOU\u2019LL UNDERSTAND SOMEDAY\u2019 | Unwilling to let go of the idea of Alexandria as a safe haven, Magna snuck away, knife in hand, and watched from the window outside Michonne\u2019s house\u2026 as her and Rick\u2019s son R.J. toddled into his mom\u2019s arms! After seeing that, no way could Magna go through with whatever plot she had hatched. Instead, she knocked on the door, handed over the knife and told Michonne that she\u2019d missed one. What\u2019s more, she understood. \u201cIf I had all this,\u201d Magna admitted, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust me, either.\u201d When Michonne turned around, there was Judith, sitting on the stairs with the pistol her dad had left for her to protect her loved ones. When Michonne noted that she was supposed to be protecting Judith, not the other way around, the little girl suggested that her dad would have wanted her to save Magna & Co. \u201cHe would\u2019ve been proud,\u201d Michonne couldn\u2019t deny. \u201cYour brother, too.\u201d Then why wouldn\u2019t Michonne help him? wondered Judith, adding that she knew her mom sometimes spoke to Rick and Carl. Judith was starting to forget their voices, so \u201cI hope you can still hear them.\u201d Clearly, that did the trick, because the next day, when the newbies were supposed to be shown the door, Michonne rode up and told them that, while Alexandria couldn\u2019t take them, she\u2019d escort them to the Hilltop, whose leader might allow them to take up residence.\n\nThe Walking Dead Season 9 Photos View Gallery 271 Images\n\n\u2018I CANNOT KEEP ON KEEPING ON\u2019 | Finally, while installing Rosita and Gabriel\u2019s amplifier at a height that was as scary as any zombie, Eugene spotted the herd whose tracks he and Ro had seen earlier headed straight for them. Considering that the tracks had been pointed in the opposite direction before, the herd, the brainiac reasoned, \u201cmust\u2019ve flipped a hardcore U on the DL.\u201d (Sound like any villains we\u2019ve been eagerly anticipating?) Unfortunately \u2014 or extra unfortunately \u2014 Eugene busted his knee hurrying down to the ground, and while hobbling from the walkers with Rosita, feared he wasn\u2019t going to make it. As such, \u201cthere\u2019s something I\u2019ve been working up the testicular gravitas to tell you,\u201d he began to say. \u201cDon\u2019t make this weird!\u201d she snapped. Rather than hear out his confession of love, she urged him onward, and to elude the herd, they buried themselves as deeply as they could in muck. Then, as the herd passed on the path just above them, it happened: For the first time, we \u2014 as well as Eugene and Rosita \u2014 heard the walkers, speaking softly enough for their voices to resemble the low moans of a zombie. \u201cThey must be close\u2026 Don\u2019t let them get away.\u201d\n\nSo, your reaction to the Whisperers\u2019 mini-introduction? The new crew? Everyone\u2019s new looks? And am I crazy, or was Eugene kinda\u2026 hot?

like, huh? Intriguing.\r\nPicking up where \"What Comes After\" left off, Sunday's episode of The Walking Dead began fleshing out the five newbies that Judith rescued, made clear that take-no-prisoners Carol was alive and kicking (ass), revealed the legs of a love triangle in the making, unveiled several new hairdos and \u2014 at long last! \u2014 gave us our first taste of the Whisperers. Was it enough to make you want to come back for seconds? First let's review the goings-on in \"Who Are You Now?\" then you can hit the comments with your thoughts on \"What the Show Is Now.\"\r\n'I HAVEN'T GIVEN UP, AND I NEVER WILL' | As the plus-sized installment began, Michonne, sporting a slick, half-shaved new \u2019do, was having one of those heart-to-hearts with Rick in her head that we all have with our lost loved ones. \"I know you're here,\" she said, unaware of how right she was, thanks to Anne. \"I'm still here, too. But it hasn't gotten any easier.\" If anything, \"the path ahead has only grown darker.\" Yet she \u2014 everyone \u2014 clung to the little things\u2026 like a toy cowboy that resembled Rick, like the bird Daryl watched pluck a worm from a walker's ear to feed its babies, like the flower Carol spotted blooming in concrete. And maybe most importantly, Michonne kept dreaming. From there, we returned to the woods where Rosita, Eugene, Aaron and others were searching frantically for Judith. When they found her with Yumiko, Magna, Connie, Kelly and Luke \u2014 and the herd not far behind \u2014\u00a0Eugene gave us a sense of how much things had changed over the course of the time jump by turning into an impressive walker-killing machine. Despite his heroics, they still had to beat a hasty retreat. Though bringing along the newbies would break mom Michonne's security protocol, Judith put her little foot down. \"If they don't go,\" she declared, \"I don't go.\" So back to Alexandria, they all went.\r\n'THIS IS ALEXANDRIA\u2026 THIS IS HOME' | Once the group reached Alexandria, Judith \u2014 definitely her brother's sister \u2014 reassured the strangers that they'd be safe there. \"Promise,\" she added, taking Magna's hand. However, once Michonne caught wind of the new arrivals, she didn't exactly roll out the welcome mat. Though she allowed Yumiko to be taken to the infirmary so that Siddiq could treat her head injury, the rest of the group would have to spend the night in holding before going before the council the following morning for a vote to decide their fate. Come judgment day, the group (except for a recuperating Miko) introduced themselves as follows to the council, which was made up of Gabriel, Michonne, Aaron, Laura, Siddiq, Nora and some guy I swear we've never seen: Magna had been a truck-stop waitress who'd become a fighter; Luke had been a music teacher and still considered himself one (since \"education never ends, even in the face of monsters and mayhem\"); hearing-impaired Connie had been a top-notch journalist who now thought of herself as sister Kelly's guardian angel; and Kelly had been a high-school kid who, since the rise of the dead, had had to grow up. That all sounded very nice. And the community, Michonne said, wanted to be generous. However\u2026 uh-oh.\r\n'THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING' | Michonne then asked to see Magna's left hand. Turned out, she was sporting a prison tattoo, one that told Michonne she'd done hard time. And it got worse. Though Magna's group had appeared to lay down their arms before entering Alexandria, Michonne, really living up to her chief-of-security title, called out the ex-con for carrying a concealed weapon (a knife in her belt). Now Gabriel could go ahead and take a vote on the group's fate, Michonne said, somehow not adding, \"The prosecution rests.\" Before Michonne stalked out of the assembly, Magna called after her. \"Can I ask you a question?\" Without breaking her stride, Michonne shot back simply, \"No.\" Later, we discovered that a) Gabriel had enough radio equipment to start WKRP in Alexandria, and b) he had become romantically involved with Rosita. (WTH? First Anne, now Rosita \u2014 the preacher gets more action than Daryl!) The couple were convinced they could reach more lovable newcomers like Magna's pals if only their signal could be boosted by a remote amplifier. Though they knew Michonne would object, and in a big way, Rosita still elected to go out a ways and install the amplifier \u2014 with, as her accomplice and technical adviser, a smitten Eugene!\r\n'THIS WORLD COULD USE A FEW MORE DREAMERS' | Meanwhile, in the Kingdom, Carol, her hair now long and white, marveled at the state of the community. \"Is there any part of this place that's not falling apart?\" she asked Jerry (rhetorically). \"Our loyalty to you, my queen,\" he replied, jovial as ever and delighting in teasing her as the wife of the king and mother of prince Henry. Speaking of whom, the resourceful, now-older boy was quick to fix a busted pipe on the boiler (?) that nearly overheated disastrously. But he was well aware that a Band-Aid was no longterm solution. \"Dad,\" he griped to Ezekiel, \"we're holding things together with plastic and tape.\" They needed better tools and someone who really knew how to use them. That someone could be Henry \u2014 if the king would allow him to go study under Earl at the Hilltop. Unfortunately, Ezekiel didn't want him trained so much as \"I want him safe.\" Besides, the big fair that he hoped would reunite the communities was just around the corner. Oh, and another thing. \"Hilltop feels so distant,\" he added. And it had ever since they'd lost the glue that had held together the communities (Rick). Still, Carol was very much in favor of them loosening the reins on Henry, at least enough to let him become a cleverer engineer.\r\n'HEY THERE, BOSS LADY' | Next thing we knew, Carol was escorting her son to the Hilltop\u2026 but taking the scenic route (even Henry could tell that they'd missed their turnoff). Shortly, they heard a woman screaming for help, and without a second thought, off ran Henry\u2026\u00a0straight into a trap set by Regina, Jed and the remains of the Saviors. Since the Sanctuary had fallen, the baddies were in dire straits. So they'd be taking all of the goodies that Carol and Henry had been bringing to the Hilltop. (Being as vile as they are, let's be real \u2014 they'd have taken the goodies regardless!) At least, since Carol had once spared Jed, he'd leave them with a pulse. Oh, but he did want her sparkly engagement ring. Ezekiel's missus readily handed it over, but Henry couldn't bear to see it on Jed's finger, and attacked. To no avail, mind you. But he tried. \"I meant to tell ya,\" Jed cracked to Carol before departing, \"I really like what you've done to your hair.\" That night, after Henry expressed his shock that his mom just gave in like that, she stole away secretly and surrounded the sleeping Saviors with gas. Jed woke up at the last second and, terrified, swore she'd never see them again. \"I know,\" she replied, setting the lot of \u2019em on fire! The following day, Henry apologized for his harsh words toward Carol and learned where their detour was taking them: to pick up Daryl. \"Need a ride, stranger?\" she asked.\r\n'IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE A GOOD OR BAD PERSON ON THE INSIDE, THE NUMBERS DON'T CARE' | Back in Alexandria, Judith did her homework within earshot of Negan, his spirits much raised since last we saw him. But he wasn't interested in helping her with theoretical math problems about two planes traveling toward one another, he wanted to help with something real. When Judith told him that a real problem was the fact that her mom was going to make the newcomers leave, he related the story of how, as a boy, he used to drive his mom crazy by bringing home stray dogs all the time, till one of them, which had seemed as sweet as the rest, had killed all of his other rescues. After that, he didn't bring home any more, he concluded. He wised up. \"Yeah,\" retorted Judith, a definite contender for TV's cutest, most precocious kid, \"and look how great everything turned out for you.\" That night, as Magna was scolded by her friends for rocking the vote against them, she argued that she'd only kept the knife because \"I wanted us to have options.\" As Luke noted, at that very moment, she was wearing yet another option: Yumiko's knife-concealing necklace! Though leaving likely meant that they would soon perish, \"if that's our fate,\" Connie argued, \"so be it.\" They weren't going to do battle with a community that had kids in it.\r\n'YOU'LL UNDERSTAND SOMEDAY' | Unwilling to let go of the idea of Alexandria as a safe haven, Magna snuck away, knife in hand, and watched from the window outside Michonne's house\u2026 as her and Rick's son R.J. toddled into his mom's arms! After seeing that, no way could Magna go through with whatever plot she had hatched. Instead, she knocked on the door, handed over the knife and told Michonne that she'd missed one. What's more, she understood. \"If I had all this,\" Magna admitted, \"I wouldn't trust me, either.\" When Michonne turned around, there was Judith, sitting on the stairs with the pistol her dad had left for her to protect her loved ones. When Michonne noted that she was supposed to be protecting Judith, not the other way around, the little girl suggested that her dad would have wanted her to save Magna & Co. \"He would've been proud,\" Michonne couldn't deny. \"Your brother, too.\" Then why wouldn't Michonne help him? wondered Judith, adding that she knew her mom sometimes spoke to Rick and Carl. Judith was starting to forget their voices, so \"I hope you can still hear them.\" Clearly, that did the trick, because the next day, when the newbies were supposed to be shown the door, Michonne rode up and told them that, while Alexandria couldn't take them, she'd escort them to the Hilltop, whose leader might allow them to take up residence.\r\n\r\n'I CANNOT KEEP ON KEEPING ON' | Finally, while installing Rosita and Gabriel's amplifier at a height that was as scary as any zombie, Eugene spotted the herd whose tracks he and Ro had seen earlier headed straight for them. Considering that the tracks had been pointed in the opposite direction before, the herd, the brainiac reasoned, \"must've flipped a hardcore U on the DL.\" (Sound like any villains we've been eagerly anticipating?) Unfortunately \u2014 or extra unfortunately \u2014\u00a0Eugene busted his knee hurrying down to the ground, and while hobbling from the walkers with Rosita, feared he wasn't going to make it. As such, \"there's something I've been working up the testicular gravitas to tell you,\" he began to say. \"Don't make this weird!\" she snapped. Rather than hear out his confession of love, she urged him onward, and to elude the herd, they buried themselves as deeply as they could in muck. Then, as the herd passed on the path just above them, it happened: For the first time, we \u2014 as well as Eugene and Rosita \u2014\u00a0heard the walkers, speaking softly enough for their voices to resemble the low moans of a zombie. \"They must be close\u2026\u00a0Don't let them get away.\"\r\nSo, your reaction to the Whisperers' mini-introduction? The new crew? Everyone's new looks? And am I crazy, or was Eugene kinda\u2026\u00a0hot?
