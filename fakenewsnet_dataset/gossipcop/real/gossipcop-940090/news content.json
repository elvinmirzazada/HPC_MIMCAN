Kailyn Lowry Reveals What She REALLY Thinks About Javi Marroquin's Baby News\n\nJavi Marroquin announced the news last week that he's expecting his second child with her new girlfriend, Lauren Comeau. After the big reveal, fans were quick to wonder...what does Kailyn Lowry think of her ex-husband expecting another child?! On her podcast, Coffee Convos, the Teen Mom 2 star didn't hold back.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: MTV\n\nKail explained that she first asked her second baby daddy if his girlfriend was pregnant in person, but he denied it. She claimed that she then called Javi hours later asking if Lauren was pregnant and he did confirm that she is expecting.\n\nSource: MTV\n\n\"I truthfully have no feelings towards them being pregnant. I'm not mad, I'm not sad, I'm not happy, like I literally wish them the best and that's it,\" she added.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nSource: MTV\n\nOne thing Kail didn't REALLY want to get into was...the timeline. As previously reported, Kailyn revealed during the Teen Mom 2 reunion taping that she and Javi hooked up after he split with Briana DeJesus. \"I'm not going to get into because...I literally am mind f****d with the timeline, because I know what the timeline is and the s**t is a little messy,\" Kail said.\n\nDespite the confusion, Kail and her co-host Lindsie Chrisley gushed over the pregnancy photos admitting they were cute.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nLast week, Javi and Lauren confirmed they are expecting their first child together this year.\n\nBack in March, Lauren confirmed that she and Javi decided to give their romance another chance. The two started dating in July of 2017 but split just weeks later in September. He then went on to date his co-star, Briana.\n\nSource: MTV\n\nWhat do you think of Kail's thoughts on the pregnancy?
