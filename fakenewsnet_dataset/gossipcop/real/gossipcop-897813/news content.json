To promote it, Universal followed its recent very short (and very cute) first footage with this trailer tease. This time, Chris Pratt's Owen Grady isn't having a sweet bonding moment with a raptor. Instead, he's running scared, and suggesting Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing do the same.\n\nThe humans aren't the only ones running, though, since it looks like a volcano has erupted. Because deadly dinos aren't enough?\n\nWatch the trailer tease: And here it is again with a note from Chris Pratt: Aaaaand here's Pratt again, with *exactly* when the full trailer will be unveiled:\n\nNow for the official synopsis from Universal:\n\n\"With all of the wonder, adventure and thrills synonymous with one of the most popular and successful franchises in cinema history, this all-new motion-picture event sees the return of favorite characters and dinosaurs\u2014along with new breeds more awe-inspiring and terrifying than ever before.
