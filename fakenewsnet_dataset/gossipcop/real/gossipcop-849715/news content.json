One week they decide to teach Meaty the bulldog to skateboard and another they buy a miniature horse that they plan to keep in their backyard. Full of practical jokes and funny stunts, Rob and Big are complete opposites who share with viewers their odd lives as best friends.\n\n\u2018Rob & Big\u2019 quickly established a digital fanbase, becoming one of MTV\u2019s fastest and best-selling shows on iTunes. Season one was the second most downloaded MTV series on iTunes behind \u201cThe Hills.\u201d The first full season of Rob & Big reached over 70 million total viewers and ranked #1 in its time period among 12-34 year-olds.\n\nYou May Also Like Learn About Merck's Research Studies for Patients with Colorectal Cancer\n\nBoykin had a defibrillator implant for his heart.
