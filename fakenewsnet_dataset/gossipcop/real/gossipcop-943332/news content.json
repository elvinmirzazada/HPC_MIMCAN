They both sported monochromatic grey outfits that looked tight, but aerodynamic as hell, and made the two moms look like straight-up TWINS.\n\nX17online\n\nGiphy\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of their ensembles are pure spandex \u2013 down to their Yeezy sock boots. To take their kloning moment to the next level, Kim and Kylie also accessorized with Starbucks drinks and large, mirrored sunglasses. The size of the frames was surprising, considering the Kardashian-Jenner fam's affinity for tiny, Matrix-like sunglasses.\n\nX17online\n\nLater that same day, Kim wore yet another tight-fitting outfit, this time a bright red ensemble that consisted of what looks like bike shorts, a top, and silver leggings (or it's a unitard/catsuit \u2013 who even knows?), which she paired with the same sunnies and sock boots as before, as well as a tiny blue bag around her neck.\n\nHonestly, these outings seem very similar to the staged paparazzi photos that Kim took part in last year to debut Kanye's Season 6 collection, in which she ran multiple \"errands\" in full Yeezy looks. Can it be a coincidence that Kim and Kylie wore Yeezy outfits and just *happened* to be photographed together with their Starbucks orders? Or that Kim wore two all-Yeezy spandex looks in one day? (OK, that one isn't SO unusual.) Either way, seems kind of suspiciousssss. I'm onto you, Kanye!\n\nFollow Lauren on Instagram.\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bf-cm-bras-6560c65567f1d.jpg?crop=0.505xw:1.00xh;0.353xw,0&resize=360:*",
