Suddenly\n\nyou\u2019re not only dealing with backpacks and after school schedules, but bottles and sleepless\n\nnights, too.\n\n\n\nMom of three Jessica Alba has both school-age children and a baby at home these days, and she tells\n\nMotherly the decision to add a third child to the family changed her family\u2019s dynamics in ways that\n\nare sometimes challenging, but mostly amazing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t plan the first two, they were more surprise and delight. The third one was the only one\n\nwhere we were actually like \u2018let\u2019s do this\u2019,\u201d says the 37-year-old actress and Honest Company\n\nfounder, who shares her three children, 10-year-old Honor, Haven (who will be 7 this month) and\n\nbaby Hayes with her husband of 10 years, Cash Warren.\n\ndata-instgrm-permalink=\u201dhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BlJL0ihBzXT/\u201d data-instgrm-version=\u201d4\u2033 style=\u201d\n\nbackground:#FFF; border:0;\n\nborder-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15);\n\nmargin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% \u2013 2px);\n\nwidth:calc(100% \u2013 2px);\u201d> \u201cWe just love having a family, we love our kids, and we felt like if we wanted to have one more, I\n\nwas getting to an age where I was like, \u2018We\u2019re either doing this now or we\u2019re not going to do it,'\u201d\n\nshe tells Motherly, adding that experiencing motherhood for the third time has been a beautiful\n\njourney not just for her and Warren, but their daughters, too. \u201cIt\u2019s actually been really neat because he\u2019s brought us all together in a really sweet way. We all\n\nlike gush over him as a family a lot,\u201d Alba explains.\n\nThe girls spend a lot of time loving on their baby brother, but at their ages they\u2019ve also got a\n\nlot going on outside the family, which is why Alba says the age gap worked out so nicely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, when they\u2019re kids and they\u2019re like 7 and 10 they\u2019re pretty independent and they have\n\nsleepovers and they do their own thing, so it\u2019s nice to have a little baby that needs us,\u201d she\n\nsays.\n\nAdding a third child to the mix obviously means that Alba and Warren\u2019s time is even more precious\n\nthese days than it was before Hayes\u2019 arrival, and the couple has taken steps to make sure that each\n\nof their daughters gets a share of each parent\u2019s time. \u201cSince we\u2019ve had him Cash and I have made it a point to spend more one on one time with the girls,\n\nso I\u2019ll take one and he\u2019ll take one for an afternoon and we\u2019ll do a little lunch or go on a hike or\n\nhave a picnic,\u201d Alba tells Motherly. \u201cBasically our daughter, whichever one we have, they get to\n\nchoose whatever they want and they have our undivided attention for that three hours. It\u2019s been\n\nreally special bonding time. We don\u2019t do it every weekend but we try to do it at least once a\n\nmonth. And that\u2019s been something the kids have really looked forward to and really liked.\u201d", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/themes/motherly/assets/svg/arrowRight.svg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/motherly-logo.svg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ARTICLE-HERO-Sand-Background-2023-11-28T131847.319-450x360.jpg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tampon-test-tiktok-450x360.jpg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/princess-eugenie-450x360.jpg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/accidental-thc-ingestion-450x360.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20360'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/paris-hilton-christmas-450x360.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2048%2048'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/baby-eating-shopping-cart-450x360.jpg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids-featured-e1644525528694.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20273%20487'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/themes/motherly/assets/svg/hero-flower-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids-featured-e1644525528694.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Heather Marcoux"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mother.ly/news/celebrity-news/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids/", "title": "Real talk with Jessica Alba: Bedtime might be the most challenging part of having 3 kids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Jessica Alba also opens up about the perks of her kids' age gap and what she and husband Cash Warren do to help each child feel special.
