This ought to be good.\n\nWhile Vicki attempts to mend her relationship with Eddie and Tamra, she lands on Kelly Dodd\u2018s bad side. \u201cKelly is stunned to learn that Vicki and Steve set up her ex-husband Michael and confronts Vicki over the betrayal.\u201d\n\nSince Eddie isn\u2019t allowed to do any heavy workouts due to his heart issues, Tamra takes over his fitness class. She introduces us and the other cast members to her new friend Gina Kirschenheiter, who recently moved to the OC from Long Island.\n\nOn tonight\u2019s episode we\u2019ll also see newbie Emily Simpson and her husband Shane celebrating their ninth wedding anniversary.\n\nShannon Beador heads to Mexico with her daughters for their first solo vacation since her divorce from David.\n\nJoin us in the comments below for all of the snarking fun at 9/8 CST!\n\nTELL US \u2013 SHOULD EDDIE FORGIVE VICKI FOR THE GAY RUMORS?\n\nPhoto Credit: Bravo TV", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9ce65fbc8a80fc2457a5f435cf1fecf3?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.realitytea.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/07/vicki-eddie-tamra.jpg?w=761", "https://www.realitytea.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/07/vicki-eddie-tamra.jpg", "https://www.realitytea.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/GettyImages-494400998.jpg?w=282&h=188&crop=1", "https://www.realitytea.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/GettyImages-1206302837.jpg?w=182&h=122&crop=1", "https://www.realitytea.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/GettyImages-507947490-1.jpg?w=182&h=122&crop=1", "https://www.realitytea.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-28-at-10.14.25-AM.png?w=182&h=122&crop=1", "https://www.realitytea.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/GettyImages-1773431634-1.jpg?w=282&h=188&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036161&cv=3.6.0&cj=1", "https://www.realitytea.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/GettyImages-1776010006.jpg?w=282&h=188&crop=1", "https://www.realitytea.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/11/GettyImages-1665728249-1.jpg?w=282&h=188&crop=1", "https://www.realitytea.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/gerryandthewomen-1.jpg?w=182&h=122&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.realitytea.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/07/vicki-eddie-tamra.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mandatory Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.realitytea.com/2018/07/23/vicki-gunvalson-uses-bible-verses-to-apologize-to-eddie-judge-on-tonights-the-real-housewives-of-orange-county/", "title": "Vicki Gunvalson Uses Bible Verses To Apologize To Eddie Judge On Tonight\u2019s The Real Housewives of Orange County", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vicki Gunvalson Uses Bible Verses To Apologize To Eddie Judge On Tonight's The Real Housewives of Orange County", "description": "The Real Housewives of Orange County is only one episode in, but we\u2019re happy to say that we have high hopes for this new season!
