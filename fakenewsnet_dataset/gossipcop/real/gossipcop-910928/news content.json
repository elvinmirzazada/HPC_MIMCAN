Ever wonder how celebrity couples like Brangelina, Tom and Gisele, and the Beckhams first met? Whether it was through mutual friends or at work, check out their love story beginnings here!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about a particular moment in my life, when someone very close to me wanted the attention of somebody else,\u201d Puth told Billboard in their new cover story published on Thursday, February 1, about his duet with Gomez, \u201cWe Don\u2019t Talk Anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I found that out and we ended it, I might have done some shady things too, and she might have asked me, \u2018How long has this been going on?'\u201d the 26-year-old singer continued. \u201cI don\u2019t kiss and tell, but the only way a song like that can come across as real is if there\u2019s something else going on behind the scenes. And that\u2019s what was happening. Very short-lived, very small, but very impactful. And it really messed me up. I\u2019m trying to put this the best way possible: It wasn\u2019t like I was the only person on her mind.
