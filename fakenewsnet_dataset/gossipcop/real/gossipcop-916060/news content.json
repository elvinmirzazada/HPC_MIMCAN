I give it three weeks.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018What?\u2019\" the 26-year-old model said in an interview with Janet Mock for her new Marie Claire cover story.\n\nRatajkowski, a vocal feminist, continued: \"No one can take women seriously on any choices that they make, especially if they\u2019re unique to them and they don\u2019t play into the way we think women should get married. It\u2019s a constant writing-off.\"\n\nRatajkowski and Bear-McClard exchanged vows in a civil ceremony in New York City on February 23, in the company of their close group of friends. The low-key nuptials shocked seemed to come out of left field, since the news came weeks after it was speculated that she and longtime boyfriend Jeff Magid split.\n\nThere were also no official reports that she and McClard were officially dating, but the couple had known each other for years and were in the same friend group prior to getting romantic, a source assured to People.\n\nRatajkowski first considered keeping the whole wedding under wraps, but her publicist convinced her to be the one to break the story. The model did just that\u2014in the most casual way possible\u2014first with a few updates on her Instagram story. \"Sooo, I have a surprise, I got married today,\" she announced in a series of photos.\n\nInstagram\n\nThe newlyweds' wedding story was sweetly unconventional, from Bear-McClard's proposal with a paper clip (yes, really) to Ratajkowski's mustard yellow bridal look.\n\n\"When you don\u2019t have a real wedding, it\u2019s for you,\" the model said of the Zara suit she wore on her wedding day. \"It really felt like the outfit that was most me, and that made me feel good.\"",
