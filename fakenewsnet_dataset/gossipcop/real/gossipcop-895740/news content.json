The couple eventually tied the knot in 2019 and welcomed their first child together in April 2022.\n\n\"I just met Cooke, and I wanted to marry him,\" Lawrence said in June 2019 on Catt Sadler's podcast Naked with Catt Sadler. \"We wanted to marry each other, we wanted to commit fully.\"\n\nThough the Red Sparrow star previously joked about the lack of romance in her life \u2014 \"What dating life?\" she said in 2016 \u2014 her record of Hollywood relationships contradicts her witty remarks.\n\nHere's a look back at Jennifer Lawrence's dating history.\n\nNicholas Hoult and Jennifer Lawrence. Dave M. Benett/Getty\n\nNicholas Hoult\n\nBefore everyone else, there was Hoult. While filming X-Men: First Class in 2010, Kentucky-born Lawrence began a romance with her British costar. They briefly split in 2013 before reuniting both off- and onscreen in X-Men: Days of Future Past. They ultimately ended their five-year relationship in August 2014.\n\nIn November 2015, Lawrence admitted she felt lost after she ended her romance with Hoult around the same time she filmed the last Hunger Games movie.\n\n\"I was also in a relationship with somebody for five years, and we broke up around the same time I wrapped the movies. Being 24 was this whole year of, 'Who am I without these movies? Who am I without this man?'\" she told ABC News' Diane Sawyer.\n\nThe two remained friendly with each other and have continued to costar together in the X-Men films Apocalypse (2016) and Dark Phoenix (2019). In a 2019 Elle interview, Hoult described working with Lawrence as \"going back to school after the summer holidays.\"\n\nJennifer Lawrence and Chris Martin. Getty (2)\n\nChris Martin\n\nLawrence also dated Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, whom she began seeing in August 2014, five months after his ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow filed for divorce. Martin and Lawrence dated for four months before they broke up for the first time in October 2014.\n\nThen, in late December of that year, the pair were presumably back together after they were spotted on a dinner date. In January 2015, they attended Harry Styles' 21st birthday party in Los Angeles. Then they were seen enjoying a cozy weekend in New York City in April and spotted together again in May in Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, in August 2015, multiple sources told PEOPLE that Lawrence and Martin split for the final time.\n\n\"Chris doesn't really want the relationship to end, but he needs to be flexible so he can see his family as much as possible with his own work schedule,\" said a Martin source. \"He's crazy about Jen but wants to keep his own schedule and be able to do what he wants when he wants to do it.\"\n\nAccording to a Lawrence friend, the actress got \"tired of Chris being so noncommittal.\"\n\nTaylor Hill/Getty\n\nDarren Aronofsky\n\nLawrence and Aronofsky began seeing each other in September 2016, shortly after wrapping Mother! \u2014 which Aronofsky wrote and directed \u2014and their relationship continued to blossom despite their 22-year age difference. The private couple kept mum about their romance while promoting the movie a year later and only posed together at the film's New York premiere.\n\nThe Silver Linings Playbook star was first spotted dining with the Brooklyn native in N.Y.C. in August 2016. They then spent time in Los Angeles in October, where they had an intimate dinner with her close friends at the Commissary restaurant at the Line Hotel. In November, they joined forces to encourage college students to get out and vote.\n\nLawrence and Aronofsky dated for a year before splitting in November 2017.\n\nThe director was previously in a nine-year relationship with actress Rachel Weisz (the two have a son) before they broke up in 2010, and Weisz moved on to marry her Dream House (2011) costar Daniel Craig in June 2011.\n\nCooke Maroney and Jennifer Lawrence. Robert O'Neil/Splash News online\n\nCooke Maroney\n\nLawrence met the art gallery director in 2018 through one of her close friends, according to Page Six TV, and the couple was later seen walking around in N.Y.C. and showing PDA several times.\n\nIn August 2018, the couple enjoyed a romantic getaway to Rome and Paris and were spotted on a few N.Y.C. dates during the following months.\n\nThe artsy couple was engaged by early February 2019, and Lawrence opened up about her then-fianc\u00e9 on her friend's podcast, Naked with Catt Sadler.\n\n\"He's my best friend. I want to legally bind him to me forever,\" Lawrence said. \"And, fortunately, the paperwork exists for such a thing. You find your favorite person on the planet, and you're like, 'You can't leave!'\"\n\nLawrence and Maroney held their wedding ceremony at the opulent Belcourt of Newport mansion in Rhode Island in October 2019, just after hosting a rehearsal dinner with over 130 guests, including Adele, Amy Schumer and Kris Jenner.\n\nAfter two years of marriage, the pair welcomed their first child, Cy, in February 2022 and named the newborn after one of Maroney's favorite painters, Cy Twombly. Lawrence spoke about motherhood to Vogue for their October 2022 issue, saying, \"My heart has stretched to a capacity that I didn't know about. I include my husband in that.\"", "images":
