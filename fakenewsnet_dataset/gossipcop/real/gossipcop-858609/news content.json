Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Prince Harry will sit down on camera to discuss the days following their mother\u2019s death in a new documentary.\n\nNBC will air a two hour examination of the tumultuous week following the death of Diana, specifically how it impacted her sons and the role they played in helping their country mourn in the aftermath. \u201cDiana, 7 Days\u201d is set to air in September to help mark the 20 year anniversary of her death.\n\nPRINCESS DIANA BIOGRAPHER SPECULATES ON WHY SHE CHOSE HIM\n\n\u201cPart of the reason why Harry and I want to do this is because we feel we owe it to her,\u201d Prince William said in a statement released by the network. \u201cI think an element of it is feeling like we let her down when we were younger. We couldn\u2019t protect her. We feel we at least owe her 20 years on to stand up for her name and remind everybody of the character and person that she was. Do our duties as sons in protecting her.\u201d\n\nNEW DOCUMENTARY ABOUT PRINCESS DIANA CREATES STIR\n\nWilliam\u2019s brother, Harry, echoed those sentiments, saying, \u201cWhen she died there was such an outpour of emotion and love which was quite shocking. It was beautiful at the same time, and it was amazing now looking back at it. It was amazing that our mother had such a huge effect on so many people. When you\u2019re that young and something like that happens to you, I think it\u2019s lodged in here, there, wherever \u2013 in your heart, in your head and it stays there for a very, very long time. I think it\u2019s never going to be easy for the two of us to talk about our mother, but 20 years on seems like a good time to remind people of the difference that she made, not just to the Royal Family but also to the world.\u201d\n\nThe documentary also promises interviews with family, close friends, political figures and journalists.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/87b5a38b-kate-middleton.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/08/03/694940094001_5530884096001_5530875270001-vs.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/brigitte.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/c4f7b18a-f99c-45fb-ab25-fdace0e2171f/1d23ddf0-c1ed-4cf8-9020-6e145c0ff556/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/08/03/896/500/694940094001_5530884096001_5530875270001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/paris-hilton-britney-spears-lindsay-lohan-present.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/evan-ellingson.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_ENT-532x120.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/Luke_Evans.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/08/03/694940094001_5530884096001_5530875270001-vs.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/princess-diana-documentary-will-feature-interviews-with-prince-william-prince-harry", "title": "Princess Diana Documentary will feature interviews with Prince William, Prince Harry", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "description": "While the world continues to be fascinated with the life and works of the late Princess Diana, two of the most important figures in her life are finally opening up about her tragic death.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Princess Diana Documentary will feature interviews with Prince William, Prince Harry", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:83b97ec9-95ee-5616-82fe-789677971e2f", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-08-10", "dcterms.created": "2017-08-10T16:25:29-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-09-26T04:49:59-04:00", "og": {"title": "Princess Diana Documentary will feature interviews with Prince William, Prince Harry", "description": "While the world continues to be fascinated with the life and works of the late Princess Diana, two of the most important figures in her life are finally opening up about her tragic death.", "type": "article", "image": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/08/03/694940094001_5530884096001_5530875270001-vs.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/princess-diana-documentary-will-feature-interviews-with-prince-william-prince-harry", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Princess Diana Documentary will feature interviews with Prince William, Prince Harry", "description": "While the world continues to be fascinated with the life and works of the late Princess Diana, two of the most important figures in her life are finally opening up about her tragic death.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/08/03/1024/512/694940094001_5530884096001_5530875270001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/princess-diana-documentary-will-feature-interviews-with-prince-william-prince-harry"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/GENRES/Documentary,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "documentary,entertainment", "classification-tags": "documentary,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
