(Those shoes!)\n\n\n\nAs previously reported, the beloved cast of Love Actually are reuniting for a 20-minute sequel of the original film in honor of U.K.-based charity Comic Relief\u2019s biennial fundraiser for Red Nose Day, which aims to support \"projects that ensure kids are safe, healthy, and educated.\" Titled Red Nose Day Actually, the sequel will allow fans to catch up with the film's cast of characters approximately 14 years after we last saw them. So far, Freud's tweets seem to suggest there are plenty of surprises in store.\n\n\n\n\u201cI would never have dreamt of writing a sequel to Love Actually, but I thought it might be fun to do 10 minutes to see what everyone is now up to,\" writer-director (and Comic Relief co-founder) Richard Curtis previously told Entertainment Weekly.\" Who has aged best? I guess that\u2019s the big question \u2014 or is it so obviously Liam [Neeson]? We\u2019ve been delighted and grateful that so many of the cast are around and able to take part \u2014 and it\u2019ll certainly be a nostalgic moment getting back together and recreating their characters 14 years later. We hope to make something that\u2019ll be fun and which we hope will help bring lots of viewers and cash to the Red Nose Day shows.\u201d\n\nRed Nose Day Actually will premiere on Mar. 24 in the U.K., and May 25 in the U.S.\n\nFollow Gina on Twitter.", "images":
