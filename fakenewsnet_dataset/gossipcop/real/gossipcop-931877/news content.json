One such animal was Cookie the Kookaburra bird.\n\n\u201cThese are kind of my alarm clocks back at home in Australia,\u201d Robert told Fallon of the long-beaked bird. \u201cThey make these really loud calls. It kind of sounds like, you know the rapper Cardi B?\u201d\n\nRobert then imitated Cardi B, encouraging Fallon to do the same, in an effort to get the Kookaburra to call out. Fallon\u2019s energetic Cardi B impression confused the bird, who sadly did not call out.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re predators, everything\u2019s based on movement, so any little animal they see that\u2019s moving they\u2019re right on it, and they attack,\u201d Robert said as the bird turned to a scared Fallon. \u201cSo don\u2019t make any sudden movements.\u201d\n\nRobert also opened up about paying tribute to his late father at his Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony last month.\n\n\u201cIt was such an amazing honor, really, a true honor for us because he\u2019s really one of the only conservationists honored on the Walk of Fame, so it\u2019s great to continue his message and really keep his dream alive,\u201d he said, noting the star is located next to his father\u2019s favorite artist, Johnny Cash.\n\nRobert brought out his mother and sister, Terri and Bindi Irwin, to introduce Fallon to what his dad called \u201cfrogs with sharp teeth\u201d \u2013 the American alligator.\n\nFor more from the Irwins, watch the clip below!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2Fshutterstock_9643584f.jpg%3Fh%3D2992ba0a&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-05%2Frobert_irwin_jimmy_fallon_youtube.jpg%3Fh%3D9e8cc5ff&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2Firwins_mega204265_001.jpg%3Fh%3D695b80f4&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/robert_irwin_jimmy_fallon_youtube.jpg?h=9e8cc5ff", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2022-03/Bindi_Irwin_GettyImages-1147029940_1920.jpg?h=b8626526&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-07%2F425_bindi_irwin_getty533404782.jpg%3Fh%3D2ed00eb6&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/robert_irwin_jimmy_fallon_youtube.jpg?h=9e8cc5ff", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jimmy-fallon-and-robert-irwin-mimic-cardi-b-to-speak-to-a-kookaburra-bird-101564", "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Robert Irwin Mimic Cardi B to Speak to a Kookaburra Bird", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/robert_irwin_jimmy_fallon_youtube.jpg?h=9e8cc5ff", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Steve Irwin's son also brought out his mom and sister,Bindi and Terri, to introduce an alligator.", "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Robert Irwin Mimic Cardi B to Speak to a Kookaburra Bird", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jimmy-fallon-and-robert-irwin-mimic-cardi-b-to-speak-to-a-kookaburra-bird-101564", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Steve Irwin's son also brought out his mom and sister,Bindi and Terri, to introduce an alligator.", "twitter": {"description": "Steve Irwin's son also brought out his mom and sister,Bindi and Terri, to introduce an alligator.", "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Robert Irwin Mimic Cardi B to Speak to a Kookaburra Bird", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jimmy-fallon-and-robert-irwin-mimic-cardi-b-to-speak-to-a-kookaburra-bird-101564", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/robert_irwin_jimmy_fallon_youtube.jpg?h=9e8cc5ff", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Jimmy Fallon and Robert Irwin Mimic Cardi B to Speak to a Kookaburra Bird | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Robert Irwin, Jimmy Fallon, Bindi Irwin", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
