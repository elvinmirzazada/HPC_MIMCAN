Additional performers will be announced at a later date.\n\n\u201cGiven the devastation of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the mass shootings in Las Vegas, we feel a commitment to our fans to address all of the tragedies not in one somber and solemn moment or segment, but rather devote the entire evening to uplifting the fans through high-spirited music,\u201d said Frank Tanki, General Manager of CMT and TV Land. \u201cThe special has always been a place where artists from different genres can stand side-by-side, and now more than ever, we want to showcase the power of unity and resilience through music.\u201d\n\nThe eighth-annual special will air live from Nashville\u2019s Schermerhorn Symphony Center on Oct. 18 at 8 p.m. ET.", "images":
