WEEI\u2019s Alex Reimer recenty referred to Brady\u2019s 5-year-old daughter Vivian as an \u201cannoying little pissant.\u201d\n\nReimer reportedly made the comment Thursday night. Brady was asked about it Monday morning around 7:30 on the \u201cKirk and Callahan Show,\u201d where the hosts said it was \u201ca stupid thing to say.\u201d\n\nTom Brady with daughter Vivian.\n\n\u201cWell, I think that \u2014 I\u2019ve tried to come on this show for many years and have showed you guys a lot of respect,\u201d Brady seethed. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to come on and do a good job for you guys, so it\u2019s very disappointing when you hear that, certainly. But my daughter or any child, they certainly don\u2019t deserve that.\u201d\n\nReimer\u2019s comment was a reference to Brady\u2019s daughter shouting to him in the opening scene of the Facebook documentary series, \u201cTom vs. Time.\u201d She was telling her dad she was going to play soccer.\n\nKirk Minihane apologized to Brady, but the QB, who is known to hold legendary grudges, cut the interview short.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll obviously evaluate whether I want to come on this show again, so I really don\u2019t have much to say this morning. So, maybe I\u2019ll speak with you guys some other time,\u201d Brady said before hanging up.\n\nAlex Reimer of WEEI\n\nAccording to WEEI, Reimer was informed Friday that he is suspended indefinitely. Minihane said on \u201cKirk and Callahan\u201d that Reimer is \u201cvery distraught.\u201d\n\nWEEI later released a statement calling Reimer\u2019s comments \u201cutterly indefensible\u201d and offering their \u201csincerest apologies\u201d to Brady.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed and embarrassed by Alex Reimer\u2019s on-air comments made last Thursday evening,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cHis remarks were utterly indefensible, and mean-spirited commentary directed in any way at children is wholly inappropriate.\u201d\n\nKevin Youkilis, the former Red Sox infielder who is married to Brady\u2019s sister Julie, shared his thoughts on Twitter Monday.\n\n\u201cAs a proud family man, it is taking everything in me to not take the low road today,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe will continually take the high road while others feel it necessary to take a swipe at our family. #Karma #Family\u201d\n\nDespite Reimer\u2019s insensitive remarks, Brady later said he doesn\u2019t hope the radio host is fired.\n\n\u201cI just said I would certainly hope the guy\u2019s not fired,\u201d Brady said at Super Bowl Media Day, per Boston.com. \u201cI would hate for that to happen.\u201d\n\nThanks to the controversy, lookups for the word \u201cpissant\u201d are up 115,000 percent on Merriam-Webster.com, the dictionary site said. The word is typically used to describe someone or some thing as insignificant or worthless.\n\nIn the first episode of \u201cTom vs. Time,\u201d an all-access documentary that follows Brady through this season, Brady summed up how the Patriots view the chaotic week heading into this week when he said, \u201cThe Super Bowl environment is all about hype and ridiculous bulls\u2014t that will go on,\u201d adding that \u201cbeing mentally tough is putting all that BS aside \u2026 and doing what you have to do.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll see if Brady manages to do that this week.", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/01/29/XTSQG4XWBLM422ATVG66XLZJPM.jpg?w=1024&h=670"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/01/29/XTSQG4XWBLM422ATVG66XLZJPM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Grossman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/01/29/tom-brady-cuts-off-radio-interview-threatens-to-end-weekly-weei-appearances-after-host-calls-daughter-annoying-little-pissant/", "title": "Tom Brady cuts off radio interview, threatens to end weekly WEEI appearances after host calls daughter \u2018annoying little pissant\u2019", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "There\u2019s a new rift forming with Tom Brady, but this one doesn\u2019t involve the Patriots.", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Tom Brady cuts off radio interview, threatens to end weekly WEEI appearances after host calls daughter \u2018annoying little pissant\u2019", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/01/29/tom-brady-cuts-off-radio-interview-threatens-to-end-weekly-weei-appearances-after-host-calls-daughter-annoying-little-pissant/", "description": "Super Bowl week got off to a frosty start for Tom Brady.
