Christopher was found dead on his property in Blackfalds, Canada earlier this month.\n\n\"Thank you to St Cuthbert\u2019s Parish Minister in Edinburgh Reverend Peter Sutton and our wonderful, joyful Scottish friends for making us laugh today,\" she wrote. \"Lighting a candle in memory of our brother, son, father, & husband, Christopher Adrian Alexander Cattrall. Forever in our thoughts. RIP xo.\"\n\nCattrall revealed her brother had died on Feb. 4, just hours after telling fans that he had been missing for days. \u201cIt is with great sadness that myself and my family announce the unexpected passing of our son and brother, Chris Cattrall,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cAt this time we ask for privacy. We want to thank you all on social media for your outpouring of love and support in this trying time.\u201d\n\nThe 61-year-old actress later thanked fans and her Sex and the City colleagues for their messages of support, but on Feb. 10, changed her tune, calling out her former co-star, Sarah Jessica Parker for reaching out. \"I don't need your love or support at this tragic time @sarahjessicaparker,\" she wrote on Instagram, adding, \"I'm writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your 'nice girl' persona.\"\n\nCattrall and Parker's feud had been growing over the last few months after Cattrall refused to do a third Sex and the City movie and said that Parker and the rest of their co-stars were never friends.\n\nFind out more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/kim_cattrall_gettyimages_542730646.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fkim_cattrall_gettyimages_542730646.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-12/gettyimages-476050887.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2Fkim_cattrall_sarah_jessica_parker_gettyimages-94458435.jpg%3Fh%3Dabf63c74&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-09%2F1280_sarah_jessica_parker_getty609478754.jpg&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2Fgettyimages-903989892.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/kim_cattrall_gettyimages_542730646.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kim-cattrall-mourns-late-brother-christopher-at-his-memorial-service-97083", "title": "Kim Cattrall Mourns Late Brother Christopher at His Memorial Service", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/kim_cattrall_gettyimages_542730646.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 61-year-old actress' brother died earlier this month in Canada.", "title": "Kim Cattrall Mourns Late Brother Christopher at His Memorial Service", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kim-cattrall-mourns-late-brother-christopher-at-his-memorial-service-97083", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 61-year-old actress' brother died earlier this month in Canada.", "twitter": {"description": "The 61-year-old actress' brother died earlier this month in Canada.", "title": "Kim Cattrall Mourns Late Brother Christopher at His Memorial Service", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kim-cattrall-mourns-late-brother-christopher-at-his-memorial-service-97083", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/kim_cattrall_gettyimages_542730646.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Kim Cattrall Mourns Late Brother Christopher at His Memorial Service | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Kim Cattrall, Deaths", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
