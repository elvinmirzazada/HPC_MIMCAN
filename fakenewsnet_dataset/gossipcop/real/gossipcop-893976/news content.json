Kim, who recently hosted an all-pink baby shower for her third baby, has since confirmed the exciting news. But fans with KarJenner baby fever had yet to hear an official confirmation on the other big family developments \u2014 until now.\n\nWell, kind of. On the November 26 episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kris Jenner dropped a major hint about Kylie and Khloe's suspected exciting news. And if a hint is all we're getting for now, we'll take it!\n\nLet's back up: The holiday-themed episode of the E! show featured a family meal that showed everyone at the table sharing what she is grateful for. Kim spilled that she's thankful for the \"calm before the storm before next year with the new baby.\"\n\nFor her part, Kylie \u2014 the maybe, possibly soon-to-be mama \u2014 showed her own mama some love. \"I\u2019m thankful for my mom, because I don\u2019t know what I would do without you,\" the Kylie Cosmetics mogul said. \"You\u2019re, like, my favorite person on the planet. You really are. I hold you in high regard.\"\n\nThen, the family matriarch dropped the baby bombshell. \u201cI used to pray that one of you guys would have a baby and now it\u2019s like a faucet that we turned on that won\u2019t turn off,\u201d Kris said. Now, it's true that the momager already has grandchildren from Kim, Kourtney Kardashian, and Rob Kardashian. But, get this: she was looking directly at Khloe and Kylie while she delivered her tearful message of gratitude. If that's not a hint, what is?\n\nKris continued: \u201cThe fact that I have all these grandchildren, it\u2019s been the most amazing journey to watch your kids because it\u2019s truly the meaning of, just, life.\u201d\n\nWhen will the Kardashians officially confirm or deny the rumors? We're over here on pins and needles, just waiting to see what happens next.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/739/207/LAB_301_PT2_2_Alexis_Bellino_More_Kids.jpg?itok=eLH05RS7", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/sonja-morgan-quincy-morgan.jpg?itok=IzYkTa78", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/04/shannon-beador-mystery-man.jpg?itok=V6SS_43W", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/themes/custom/reality/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/candiace-dillard-dorothy-watts.jpg?itok=FW55_ZPt", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/sutton-stracke.jpg?itok=hhQduioE", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/dubrow.jpg?itok=_PwVmL0Y", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/rhom-lisa-hochstein_0.jpg?itok=qb_ygHZ4", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/Kathy-Hilton-Kyle-Richards-Mauricio-Umansky.jpg?itok=pfDsfn5Z", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/09/winter-house-season-3-tom-schwartz_0.jpg?itok=2jF41LfT", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/06/heather-dubrow-terry-dubrow-life-update.jpg?itok=UtiWZ9q4", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/11/dish-112717-kris-jenner.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/mia-thornton-family.jpg?itok=EuiR7Ke7", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/dorit-kemsley-family.jpg?itok=l6gTc4NA", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/515/407/171120_3622816_Kim_Kardashian___s_Pregnancy__Dr__Jackie_Wal.jpg?itok=rq2QnG3p", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/fredrik-eklund-family.jpg?itok=4MfJypy-", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/bravolebs-chaos-dinner-party-fashion.jpg?itok=w6IPg42I"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/11/dish-112717-kris-jenner.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/kris-jenner-drops-hint-about-khloe-kardashian-and-kylie-jenner-pregnancies", "title": "Kris Jenner Hints Khloe Kardashian Kylie Jenner Pregnant", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1130113, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Kris Jenner Hinted About Khloe and Kylie's Pregnancies\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/11\\/dish-112717-kris-jenner.jpg?itok=SMAmhujG\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/11\\/dish-112717-kris-jenner.jpg?itok=XvY6o0-B\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/11\\/dish-112717-kris-jenner.jpg?itok=I4yX92Na\",\"70x70\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/fp_scale_crop_70x70\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/11\\/dish-112717-kris-jenner.jpg?itok=q5ocwQrc\"}}", "description": "Rumors have swirled for months that sisters\u00a0Kylie Jenner, Khloe Kardashian, and\u00a0Kim Kardashian are expecting little ones.
