The product in question? An underwear-clad blow-up doll with Kimmel\u2019s face.\n\nDeGeneres asked Damon a series of leading questions about the product, and the Cambridge native\u2019s answers left the audience in hysterics.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAmong the highlights:\n\n\u2014 On how to use the product: \u201cIt depends. Some people use it more than once a day; some people use it once a week. That\u2019s what\u2019s great about it. It\u2019s versatile and very user-friendly.\u201d\n\n\u2014 On how using the product makes Damon feel: \u201cRelaxed. Which is really the goal. At the end of a stressful day, you want to kick back and relax a bit.\u201d\n\n\u2014 On his wife\u2019s opinion of the product: \u201cWell, that\u2019s who I heard about it from. She called me \u2014 I was at work \u2014 and she said, \u2018Hey, this is a hell of a product.'\u201d", "images": ["https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Film_Review_-_Air_21652-64873626726d4-768x432.jpg", "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc-2020/dist/images/boston-com-logo.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=813236348753005&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/KQQUUCIKHRKZXIKEB3ZWBNUJAA-6565175991af5-scaled.jpg?width=190", "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/BDC_Logo_2020_256x256-60d0abc34135e.png", "https://boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-29-at-9.56.42-AM-65675f4f68add.jpg?width=190", "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/summer-movie-preview-2023-barbie-645d185ccfd05-150x150.jpg", "https://boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Media_Counterfeit_Writers_07767-65666fb20604d-scaled.jpg?width=190", "https://boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/s3___bgmp-arc_arc-feeds_generic-photos_to-arc_112823_CelticsvBulls_15-65669fc8bd021-scaled.jpg?width=190", "https://boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lehrhaus-65665c8bb33da-scaled.jpg?width=190", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=989222871864976&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ben-Affleck-Phil-Knight-Air-movie-642c4cf795106-150x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/BDC_Logo_2020_256x256-60d0abc34135e.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kevin Slane"], "canonical_link": "https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2017/10/26/watch-matt-damon-sell-a-half-naked-jimmy-kimmel-blow-up-doll/", "title": "Watch Matt Damon sell a half-naked Jimmy Kimmel blow-up doll", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch Matt Damon sell a half-naked Jimmy Kimmel blow-up doll", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mv8_OcYysU Matt Damon may say he\u2019s not a fan of Jimmy Kimmel, but thanks to a prank by Ellen DeGeneres, Damon briefly became the biggest fan of a plastic version [\u2026]", "url": "https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2017/10/26/watch-matt-damon-sell-a-half-naked-jimmy-kimmel-blow-up-doll/", "site_name": "Boston.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/BDC_Logo_2020_256x256-60d0abc34135e.png", "width": 256, "height": 256, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/boston", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/slane", "published_time": "2017-10-26T16:23:18+00:00", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "author": "Kevin Slane", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jimmy-kimmel-matt-damon-blow-up-doll-768x432.jpg", "creator": "@kslane", "site": "@BostonDotCom", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Kevin Slane", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://www.boston.com", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BDC_Logo_2020_Social_WhiteBG-609c79a967eee.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508965200.0, "source": "https://www.boston.com", "summary": ""}
