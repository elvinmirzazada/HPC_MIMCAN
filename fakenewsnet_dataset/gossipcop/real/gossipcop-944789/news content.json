Meghan appeared to lose her footing as she held on to her floaty \u00a33,922 long-sleeved blue-and-white floral Oscar de la Renta wrap dress. But Prince Harry, 33, saved the day when he sprang into action and helped his new bride as they walked hand-in-hand towards the church in the village of Rochford, Lincolnshire. The newlyweds\u2019s appearance came just one month after the pair tied the knot for the Royal Wedding in Windsor.\n\nAnd all eyes were on the royal couple when they arrived for Princess Diana\u2019s niece Celia McCorquodale\u2019s wedding to George Woodhouse alongside Prince Harry\u2019s cousin and the bride\u2019s brother George McCorquodale. Sporting minimal make up and her signature messy bun, Meghan looked set for summer in a pretty floral frock teamed with a white fascinator, thought to be just \u00a329.50 from Marks and Spencer, and a small mirrored clutch bag. However, the floaty maxi dress has received mixed reviews from online royal watchers, with some even likening the frock to a baggy pair of curtains and a table cloth. While many thought the floral frock \u201cswamped\u201d the 36-year-old duchess.\n\nMeghan Markle narrowly avoided taking a tumble\n\nMeghan Markle was steadied by her husband Prince Harry\n\nMeghan Markle appeared to slip on the unsteady pathway\n\nBecome an Express Premium member Support fearless journalism\n\nSupport fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online, advert free\n\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-day\n\nFREE trial\n\nThe new Duchess of Sussex had to be steadied by her doting husband Prince Harry\n\nBut Meghan Markle, 36, appeared relaxed and at ease as she mingled and greeted guests of the congregation including members of the Spencer family, Lady Kitty Spencer and Princess Diana\u2019s siblings Earl Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes. However there was no sign of Kate and Prince William at the country wedding. Royal expert, Richard Fitzwilliams, told Express.co.uk it is due to the fact Kate is on maternity leave and spending quality time with her third child, Prince Louis. Princess Diana\u2019s niece Celia got married in a lavish country wedding this weekend and the beautiful bride stunned in the same dazzling tiara worn by her auntie at her Royal Wedding to Prince Charles.", "images": ["https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/183x122/1840188_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/183x122/1840128_1.jpg",
