In fact, the Shahs of Sunset mom is open to expanding her family a little more in the future.\n\nHow to Watch Catch up on Shahs of Sunset on the Bravo App.\n\n\"I\u2019m raising my little family, and we want to definitely give Soltan a brother or a sister,\" she recently told Parade, noting that she is open to traveling the globe with her family -- parents, brother, and baby daddy, Jermaine Jackson Jr., and all.\n\nRelated\n\nSince welcoming Soltan into her life, Asa admits that things are a little different from her days B.B. (before baby). \"It\u2019s completely and absolutely changed my life. I just don\u2019t feel like the same person anymore. I don\u2019t remember life before my son, Soltan. He\u2019s five-and-a-half months and I don\u2019t remember what things were like beforehand,\" she said. \"It\u2019s the most beautiful thing. Jermaine and I just sit there when he\u2019s asleep, and we just stare and gush like, 'Oh my God, that\u2019s my chin, and that\u2019s his nose and that\u2019s his eyes.' He has a big Persian Afro of big curls and thick eyebrows and lashes. We just die over him! But I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s way harder than I thought too. The working mom thing is so tough. I think mothers are angels, and I couldn\u2019t do it without my own mom because she helps me with him.\"\n\nYou can watch Asa's baby journey when Shahs premieres Sunday at 8/7c.
