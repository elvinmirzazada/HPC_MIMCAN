Back then we didn\u2019t have the internet or social media or reality TV, but I didn\u2019t need any of that to understand that I didn\u2019t look or act like other girls in my industry, and that I was immersing myself in a business that rewarded physical beauty and sex appeal above all else.\n\nNothing has been a harsher reminder that I work in an industry that profits on the exploitation of women \u2014 and not just on screen \u2014 than the accusations of Harvey Weinstein as a serial sexual assaulter, particularly of aspiring young actresses. Though I am shocked and disgusted by the scope of his alleged predation, the fact that he may have abused his position of power does not surprise me in the least.\n\nI have always had an uncomfortable relationship with being employed in an industry that profits on the objectification of women. Though pressure to \u201cbe like the pretty girls\u201d started long before I entered Hollywood, I quickly learned even as a preteen actress that young girls with doe eyes and pouty lips who spoke in a high register were favored for roles by the powerful men who made those decisions.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=e4f9731cb704334d60f52866211edad0aff99a5b1e53dff19c6177228985b31f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=e4f9731cb704334d60f52866211edad0aff99a5b1e53dff19c6177228985b31f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mayim Bialik"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html", "title": "Mayim Bialik: Being a Feminist in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s World - The New York Times", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "I have always had an uncomfortable relationship with being employed in an industry built on the objectification of women.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | Mayim Bialik: Being a Feminist in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s World (Published 2017)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=e4f9731cb704334d60f52866211edad0aff99a5b1e53dff19c6177228985b31f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "Mayim Bialik as Blossom Russo in season one of \u201cBlossom.\u201d"}, "description": "I have always had an uncomfortable relationship with being employed in an industry built on the objectification of women."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html", "title": "Opinion | Mayim Bialik: Being a Feminist in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s World (Published 2017)", "description": "I have always had an uncomfortable relationship with being employed in an industry built on the objectification of women.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg?year=2017&h=1687&w=3000&s=13df5af2de03f014fcfd5546b9d6a4c31798b42ea111c80cacd631b2a8f4477f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "alt": "Mayim Bialik as Blossom Russo in season one of \u201cBlossom.\u201d"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/16adebf6-247e-5081-bdb8-1faa5a0f0e4d"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-13T10:22:55.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-14T16:52:59.000Z", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Weinstein, Harvey", "opinion": "true", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000005493485, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/16adebf6-247e-5081-bdb8-1faa5a0f0e4d", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/93a369fa7b7f48698445bba67628769c", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/opinion/13bialik3web/13bialik3web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=e4f9731cb704334d60f52866211edad0aff99a5b1e53dff19c6177228985b31f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Mayim Bialik", "news_keywords": "Women and Girls,Actor,TV,Women's rights;Feminism,Harvey Weinstein", "pdate": 20171013, "CG": "opinion", "PT": "article", "PST": "Op-Ed", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/16adebf6-247e-5081-bdb8-1faa5a0f0e4d", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/opinion/mayim-bialik-feminist-harvey-weinstein.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507842000.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
