I mean, I love the show. I\u2019ll always be a part of either the show somehow \u2013 Dancing with the Stars \u2014 or just being a part of like the movement of dance,\u201d Hough, 29, explained.\n\n\u201cIt really has been a movement of dance in the last 10 years between all the different shows that have really elevated and put dancers on a platform that I feel like they deserve,\u201d she shared. \u201cUsually dancers are in the background supporting, but they\u2019re at the forefront right now and it makes me so happy that I was a part of that journey too.\u201d\n\nAlthough she\u2019s hung up her DWTS dancing shoes for now, NHL pro Laich, 34, who most recently played for the Los Angeles Kings, is open to joining the competition.\n\nWhen asked if he\u2019d ever consider doing the show, Laich said, \u201cYou know what, I would.\u201d\n\nHis reasoning? \u201cI would because I want to learn technically how to lead my wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said we dance in the kitchen. I try and lead, I try and have a presence of leadership, but I don\u2019t technically know how to move her the way that she\u2019s been moved in her life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird to say man, it\u2019s weird to say, but I would do the show just to be able to have that education.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Julianne Hough Is Married! the \u2018DWTS\u2019 Judge Weds NHL Star Brooks Laich in an Elegant Outdoor Idaho Ceremony\n\nLast July, Hough and Laich tied the knot during a romantic, outdoor wedding on Lake Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho, and honeymooned in the same spot as Will and Kate, and George and Amal Clooney.\n\n\u201cYeah, beach and bush is what they call it. Seychelles was incredible to decompress. It was nice to be able to chill and relax,\u201d Hough told PEOPLE in August.\n\nJason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nOf married life, she admitted, \u201cIt definitely feels different being married. People have always said that and I didn\u2019t understand it but now I feel more whole.\u201d\n\nAs for her favorite part of being married? \u201cJust being able to call him husband is so fun. It was actually when we got our marriage certificate. It was like \u2018How are you doing, husband?\u2019 It was fun,\u201d Hough said.\n\nDancing with the Stars will return with a four-week special athletes edition, premiering April 30 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.", "images":
