But little do fans know, the 23-year-old\u2019s introduction to the modeling industry was actually on Tyra Banks\u2018s reality TV competition, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Next Top Model.\u201d On a recent episode of Andy Cohen\u2018s \u201cWatch What Happens Live,\u201d Harlow opened up about her time on reality TV, and let\u2019s just say, she isn\u2019t exactly pleased with people who credit \u201cANTM\u201d as her big break.\n\nAs some might remember, Harlow competed on Cycle 21 of \u201cANTM.\u201d The model, then known under her birth name, Chantelle Young, was eliminated in week two, but was brought back by fans later on and eventually finished in sixth place. When asked about her time on the show, Harlow wasn\u2019t afraid to call out \u201cANTM\u201d for the lack of opportunities it provides for its contestants.\n\n\u201c[My success] started after the show, \u2019cause that really didn\u2019t do anything for my career\u2026which, it doesn\u2019t do anything for any model\u2019s career, realistically,\u201d she said. \u201cA photographer from London hit me up\u2014major photographer Nick Knight\u2014and he was like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve seen your photos online, and I want to do a shoot with you.\u2019 It went viral, and I got campaigns from there, and it hasn\u2019t stopped since.\u201d\n\nHarlow admitted that when she signed on for \u201cANTM,\u201d she expected the show to lead to major modeling opportunities. She was quickly disappointed when she realized that \u201cANTM\u201d was more dedicated to pushing a reality TV storyline than making its models successful.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018That\u2019s going to be a career starter.\u2019 But it was really a reality TV show. That\u2019s not what I signed up for,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the end, however, Harlow doesn\u2019t look back on her time on \u201cANTM\u201d with regret. Though the show didn\u2019t lead the opportunities that she had hope, it did influence her career, one way or another. \u201cIt\u2019s still a part of my history, and I\u2019m really grateful for everything that I\u2019ve done to get where I am,\u201d Harlow said.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to hear Banks\u2019s response.", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetabercrombiejeans.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/zodiacsignsasvideogames_2-1.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Winnie-Harlow-blonde-hair-paul-mitchell.jpg?w=712&h=400&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1-Square.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/winnie-harlow1.jpg", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CAYSKIN-winnie-harlow.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/airpods-black-friday-deals.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/irrational-found-renewed-season-2-nbc.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/jamie-lynn.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetsweaterset.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/root-cover-up-fi.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/daisy-jones-and-the-six.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RemiBader_Homepage.webp?w=244", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rosamund-Pike-Saltburn.png?resize=232,175", "https://spy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sdfgve.png?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/beyonce.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/olivia-rodrigo-merch.gif?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uggdupestarget.gif?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Taylor-Swift.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/winnie-harlow1.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/olivercabellsneakersale.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ChatGPT.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bestprodsforthinninghair.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/henry-kissinger.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mean-girls.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/winnie-harlow1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Pham"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/731890/winnie-harlow-diss-americas-next-top-model/", "title": "Winnie Harlow Disses \u2018America\u2019s Next Top Model\u2019 for Doing Nothing for Her Career", "meta_data": {"description": "Model Winnie Harlow dissed Tyra Banks's reality TV show \"America's Next Top Model\" for doing nothing for her career.
