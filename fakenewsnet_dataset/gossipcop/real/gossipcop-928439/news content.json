{"url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a19861744/gwyneth-paltrow-bf-gold-band-wedding-rumor/", "text": "Gwyneth Paltrow spent her weekend celebrating her engagement to producer Brad Falchuk at a 400-guest \"over-the-top\" party according to both Page Six and Paltrow's Instagram. And while there was some speculation that the soiree was actually a secret wedding\u2014Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, and more A-listers showed\u2014multiple sources confirmed to Page Six it really was just an extravagant engagement celebration. A wedding is said to be scheduled in the Hamptons later this year.\n\nGP is wearing a new ring though after the party. She showed off a \"BF\" gold band on her left ring finger at the Pre-Broadway Opening Engagement Of Head Over Heels in San Francisco. BF is obviously Falchuk's initials, so she's very clearly wearing a tribute to her husband-to-be. Whether the ring will be a regular addition to Paltrow's outfits or is just a one-night statement piece, future red carpet appearances will determine. But it's a pretty smart move on Paltrow's part to keep outlets buzzing about her future secret wedding whenever that may actually be:\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nPaltrow was adoringly gushy about Falchuk in her last Instagram about their party, if that gives any hints about how often the new ring will be worn until she gets her wedding band. She wrote: \"Thank you @mrrpmurphy for the most incredible evening to celebrate our \u2764\ufe0f. There will never be adequate words to express our gratitude. @giambattistavalliparis I will never get over my gorgeous dress. @georgieeisdell thank you. @hairbylorenzomartin thank you. @teamsaltzman thank you.
