The extended episode titled \u2018How It\u2019s Gonna Be\u2019 unleashed a shocking move as it was revealed Carl Grimes (played by Chandler Riggs) had been bitten by a walker. In the tense instalment, Rick Grimes\u2019 son (Andrew Lincoln) had offered his own life to Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) as they arrived to bomb Alexandria. He told the leader of the Saviours: \u201cIf you have to kill someone, if there have to be punishments, then kill me. I\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\nAMC The Walking Dead season 8: Carl Grimes' days are numbered\n\n\u201cYou want to die?\u201d Negan asked. Carl replied: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. But I will. It\u2019s gonna happen. And if me dying can stop this, if it can make things different for us, for you, for all those other kids, it\u2019d be worth it.\u201d His bold decision soon made sense to viewers at the end of the episode when a huge bite mark on his torso was shown. With Carl\u2019s days numbered, will his death be played out in the first episode when the show returns next year?\n\nAMC The Walking Dead season 8: Rick Grimes will be devastated to hear his son is dying\n\nBecome an Express Premium member Support fearless journalism\n\nSupport fearless journalism Read The Daily Express online, advert free\n\nRead The Daily Express online, advert free Get super-fast page loading Start 30-day\n\nFREE trial\n\nThe shock twist of Carl's impending death left fans of the hit show in floods of tears. One distraught fan wrote on Twitter: \u201cARE YOU SERIOUSLY KIDDING ME...OH MY GOD I AM SITTING IN A PUDDLE OF TEARS RIGHT NOT WHY DOES TWD ALWAYS DO THIS TO ME #TheWalkingDead.\u201d \u201cIf you need me I\u2019ll be crying over Carl #TWD #TheWalkingDead,\u201d said another upset viewer. However, some fans were clinging on to the hope of a cure as one person wrote: \u201cI\u2019m not fully convinced that Carl is going to die. I don\u2019t know how, but I feel like he\u2019s going to live. #TheWalkingDead.\u201d\n\nAMC The Walking Dead season 8: Carl Grimes was bitten", "images":
