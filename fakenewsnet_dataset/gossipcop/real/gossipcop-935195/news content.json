Apple Martin, whose father is Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, turns 14 on May 14, making it a double celebration of sorts for the family.\n\nPaltrow\u2019s not the only star who chose to share a private pregnancy photo for Mother\u2019s Day. Actor Ian Somerhalder marked wife Nikki Reed\u2019s first Mother\u2019s Day as a parent by posting a nude maternity photo from her pregnancy with their daughter, Bodhi Soleil, who turns 1 in July.\n\nSomerhalder himself took the photo, which was \u201cliked\u201d by Reed on Instagram. Like Paltrow, she is completely unclothed and using her hand to cover her chest.\n\nMany fans were touched by the Vampire Diaries star\u2019s tribute to his wife, saying they \u201cneed someone like [him]\u201d in their lives.\n\nSo, the public approves. Whether or not the \u201cbabies\u201d themselves will \u2014 kids will be kids, after all \u2014 remains to be seen.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YMq2U1Ys7ytjiPUd5ZrEZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/779f80b40fcd16f7d3452b970caf4907", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/google-play-icon@3x.png", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_sports_en-US_h_p_sports_2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/app-store-icon@3x.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DGC1gUwrj87WjOspbgWX6g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTE2NjtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/aa5a87b0-7e4e-11ea-bdfd-b9950c4c15e2", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=2716427&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fgwyneth-paltrow-nikki-reed-mark-mothers-day-unclothed-pregnancy-photos-115136571.html&c14=-1"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YMq2U1Ys7ytjiPUd5ZrEZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/779f80b40fcd16f7d3452b970caf4907", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/gwyneth-paltrow-nikki-reed-mark-mothers-day-unclothed-pregnancy-photos-115136571.html", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Nikki Reed mark Mother's Day with unclothed pregnancy photos", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "news_keywords": "Gwyneth Paltrow, Mother\u2019s Day, Ian Somerhalder, happy Mother\u2019s Day, Chris Martin, pregnancy photo, Nikki Reed, Apple Martin", "twitter": {"title": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Nikki Reed mark Mother's Day with unclothed pregnancy photos", "description": "The actresses both bared all in throwback photos from their first pregnancies in honor of the special day.", "site": "@YahooSports", "dnt": "on", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YMq2U1Ys7ytjiPUd5ZrEZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/779f80b40fcd16f7d3452b970caf4907", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YMq2U1Ys7ytjiPUd5ZrEZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/779f80b40fcd16f7d3452b970caf4907"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"title": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Nikki Reed mark Mother's Day with unclothed pregnancy photos", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/gwyneth-paltrow-nikki-reed-mark-mothers-day-unclothed-pregnancy-photos-115136571.html", "description": "The actresses both bared all in throwback photos from their first pregnancies in honor of the special day.", "type": "article", "site_name": "Yahoo Sports", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YMq2U1Ys7ytjiPUd5ZrEZg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/779f80b40fcd16f7d3452b970caf4907", "width": 1200, "height": 1800}}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "al": {"android": {"url": "ysportacular://v2/news/details?articleUuid=82ab52bb-70a3-3530-b142-6195b3080d6c&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo Sports", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.sportacular"}, "ios": {"url": "ysportacular://v2/news/details?articleUuid=82ab52bb-70a3-3530-b142-6195b3080d6c&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo Sports", "app_store_id": 286058814}}, "description": "The actresses both bared all in throwback photos from their first pregnancies in honor of the special day."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://sports.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
