Jenelle\u2019s attorney, Heather D. Kaemmer, told PEOPLE that the reality star and her mother had settled on a custody schedule that allows them to share time with 7-year-old Jace.\n\nAnd this past weekend, the mother and son had an \u201camazing\u201d reunion when they were reunited after five weeks spent apart.\n\nSource: Jenelle Evans/Instagram\n\n\u201cIt felt amazing to finally be reunited,\u201d Jenelle told E! News about spending time with her oldest child. \u201cHe was so happy he didn\u2019t even know what to do first when he got home. I was nervous a little bit because I didn\u2019t want Jace thinking it was me that didn\u2019t want to visit with him, but when he arrived everything was back to the way it used to be.\u201d\n\nAlthough the mother of three \u2014 she is mom to Jace, son Kaiser, 2, and newborn daughter Ensley Jolie \u2014 did she some tears, it was a happy reunion.\n\n\u201cI did cry but not around anyone except for David,\u201d said Jenelle, who is engaged to fianc\u00e9 David Eason. \u201cI didn\u2019t want any of the kids thinking I was upset. Lots of hugs and kisses we\u2019re going around all weekend!\u201d\n\nTo celebrate the three-day weekend, the MTV personality and her children, along with Eason\u2019s daughter Maryssa, rode bikes and enjoyed some time hiking and at the beach. \u201cCouldn\u2019t have asked for a better weekend,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy next visit with him is this upcoming weekend since his summer school break will begin,\u201d said Jenelle, who will reportedly have Jace for his entire summer break. \u201cWe are planning on taking the kids on vacation so that should be lots of fun!\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: What\u2019s Next for Princess Charlotte\n\nAlthough the Evans v. Evans case between Jenelle and her mother was scheduled for two days of trial beginning May 24, \u201cthe parties re-opened settlement negotiations and were able to come to an agreement before the trial started\u201d on May 24, Kaemmer said. (Barbara, with whom Jenelle has long had a tense relationship, maintains primary custody of Jace.)\n\nAccording to Kaemmer, \u201cBarbara and Jenelle settled on a custody schedule that allows them to share time with Jace,\u201d Kaemmer told PEOPLE. \u201cThe new Order grants Jenelle specific periods of time with Jace so that Barbara no longer has the authority to determine if and when Jenelle can spend time with her son.\u201d", "images":
