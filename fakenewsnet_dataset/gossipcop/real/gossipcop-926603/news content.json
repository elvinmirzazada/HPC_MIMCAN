I sought and received treatment, I put positive people around me and I got back to doing what I love \u2014 writing songs and making music.\u201d\n\nCliff Watts\n\nOne of the most successful singers of all time, with 18 No. 1 hits and more than 200 million records sold, Carey spent many of her years in the spotlight suffering in silence.\n\nShe is now in therapy and taking medication for bipolar II disorder, which involves periods of depression as well as hypomania (less severe than the mania associated with bipolar I disorder, but can still cause irritability, sleeplessness and hyperactivity).\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

It\u2019s not making me feel too tired or sluggish or anything like that. Finding the proper balance is what is most important,\u201d Carey tells PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cFor a long time I thought I had a severe sleep disorder,\u201d continues Carey, now back in the studio working on an album due later this year. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t normal insomnia and I wasn\u2019t lying awake counting sheep. I was working and working and working \u2026 I was irritable and in constant fear of letting people down. It turns out that I was experiencing a form of mania. Eventually I would just hit a wall. I guess my depressive episodes were characterized by having very low energy. I would feel so lonely and sad \u2014 even guilty that I wasn\u2019t doing what I needed to be doing for my career.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: PEOPLE Exclusive: Mariah Carey Is Managing Her Bipolar Disorder With Medication & Therapy\n\nCarey, who co-parents her 6-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan with ex-husband Nick Cannon, says she decided to come forward because \u201cI\u2019m just in a really good place right now, where I\u2019m comfortable discussing my struggles with bipolar II disorder. I\u2019m hopeful we can get to a place where the stigma is lifted from people going through anything alone. It can be incredibly isolating. It does not have to define you and I refuse to allow it to define me or control me.\u201d\n\nFor more on Mariah Carey and her battle with bipolar disorder, dealing with fame and raising twins, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.
