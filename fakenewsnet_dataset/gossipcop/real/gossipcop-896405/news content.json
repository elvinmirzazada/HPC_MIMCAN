The venue has long been booked, but just who will be entering the doors of St. George\u2019s chapel to witness the matrimony?\n\nWho will make the cut on the guest list? What role will two future kings \u2014 Harry\u2019s brother, Prince William, and his nephew, Prince George \u2014 play in the ceremony? And what will the world call Markle after she formally becomes royalty?\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle want the public to feel part of their celebration as much as possible. Chris Jackson / Getty Images\n\nWhile some of the answers won\u2019t be known until the actual event, we\u2019ll try to tackle some of the burning questions about the upcoming wedding of the year. Kensington Palace, the official residence and office of the engaged couple, has provided a few details already. We\u2019ll try to fill in some others.\n\nThe big day: What, when and where?\n\nThe couple revealed their May 19, 2018, wedding date shortly after they publicly announced their engagement. With the blessing of Harry\u2019s grandmother Queen Elizabeth, the ceremony will take place in St. George\u2019s Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Harry was christened inside the 15th century gothic chapel, which can seat about 800 people. Compare that to the 1,900 guests that Prince William and the former Kate Middleton invited to their 2011 wedding at Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe event is expected to be televised, but Americans who want to watch from home will have to set their alarm clocks: The service will begin at noon local time \u2014 which means 7 a.m. for folks on the East Coast, and 4 a.m. for West Coast viewers.\n\nThe couple to hold the ceremony at St. George's Chapel, located on the grounds of the royal residence in Windsor, England.

Harry and Markle will open up the castle grounds (which is normally open to tourists but will be closed on the wedding day) to some local school children, charity workers and select individuals chosen by local leaders throughout the United Kingdom.\n\nThe rest of the public will have to join the crowds lined along the route of a carriage procession transporting the couple through the streets of Windsor once the two have tied the knot.\n\nHarry and Markle will ride in a carriage following their ceremony, just as Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did after their April 2011 wedding.

While that ceremony included Prince Harry as his brother\u2019s best man and Kate\u2019s sister, Pippa, as maid of honor, royal weddings don\u2019t typically include parties like the ones compiled by American brides and grooms.\n\n\u201cHistorically, there\u2019s no such thing as a best man in a royal wedding,\u201d said Marlene Koenig, an academic librarian who has studied British and European royalty. Instead, the best man equivalent is known as a \u201csupporter.\u201d\n\nPrince William and his new bride Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge walk down the aisle followed by best man Prince Harry and Maid of Honor Pippa Middleton at the close of their wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London.

It could be a sensitive subject.\u201d\n\nBut the two have a close relationship, forged in part during their recovery from the 1997 death of their mother Princess Diana. So it\u2019s a safe bet that William will stand beside Harry at the wedding, regardless of what his role will be officially called.\n\nThe two princes are close, but will Prince Harry ask his brother to be best man?

That's because royal weddings traditional have young children serve as bridesmaids \u2014 and pages.\n\nAmong the ladies royal watchers expect to see at the wedding in one role or another are her \u201cSuits\u201d co-star Abigail Spencer and tennis queen Serena Williams.\n\nWill the Obamas be coming to the wedding?\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, have had a warm friendship with Prince Harry, as well as his brother Prince William. (Remember the time the Obamas met a robe-clad Prince George inside Kensington Palace?)\n\nThe Obamas have worked together with Harry on numerous occasions, including a luncheon for military families and at the annual event dear to the prince's heart, the Invictus Games, the Paralympic-style competition for wounded veterans.\n\nUnfortunately for you @FLOTUS and @POTUS I wasn't alone when you sent me that video \ud83d\ude09 - H.https://t.co/sjfSQvkzb6 \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 29, 2016\n\nWhen Harry was asked on a BBC radio show in late December whether he planned to invite the former American president, the prince eluded giving a direct answer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that \u2014 we haven\u2019t even put the invites or the guest list together yet so who knows whether he\u2019s going to be invited or not,\" he said. \"I wouldn't want to ruin that surprise.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/201803/tdy_pop_ali_royals_180303_1920x1080.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_11/1324415/st-georges-chapel-windsor-today-180313_d0bd0495e47e6885e092f54846d5cc40.fit-324w.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_11/1324414/meghan-markle-prince-harry-today-180313-tease-02_d0bd0495e47e6885e092f54846d5cc40.fit-324w.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/201803/tdy_pop_royals_180316_1920x1080.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_11/1324417/harry-william-pippa-wedding-today-180313_d0bd0495e47e6885e092f54846d5cc40.fit-324w.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_52/1306550/ss-meghan-markle-171225-03_578b28d7a4b13f83b5671b558650f955.fit-320w.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_11/1324416/kate-william-carriage-today-180313_d0bd0495e47e6885e092f54846d5cc40.fit-324w.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_11/1325488/jean-delores-sister-loyola-ncaa-nun-today-tease-2-180319_0c52dda0a7aafd8bbd5aea3517857d43.focal-760x380.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_12/1325649/gettyimages-113269931_6913dc52053de690ba3305c3b781cb41.fit-324w.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://c.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/201711/tdy_news_kelly_royals_171129_1920x1080.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_11/1324429/prince-harry-william-wedding-page-today-180313_1ae3c8a1f6faf63be7ae800872d1f5b3.fit-324w.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_11/1324412/meghan-markle-prince-harry-today-180313-tease-01_d0bd0495e47e6885e092f54846d5cc40.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_11/1324413/meghan-markle-prince-harry-today-180313-main-art2_09ee59031b3984c6309fda74aa7cb209.focal-760x380.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201803/tdy_mk_news_marijuana_180316.focal-760x380.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_12/1325711/cynthia-nixon-governor-ny-today-180319-tease_99a4a91401396f126e39ca038017c504.focal-760x380.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_48/1300087/princess-george-charlotte-pippa-wedding-today-171129_47c2c7537cbd68f8988d43ffc337a2ca.fit-320w.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_11/1324412/meghan-markle-prince-harry-today-180313-tease-01_d0bd0495e47e6885e092f54846d5cc40.1200;630;7;70;5.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717/https://www.today.com/news/burning-questions-about-meghan-markle-prince-harry-s-royal-wedding-t125076", "title": "Burning questions about Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's royal wedding", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180320235717/https://www.today.com/news/burning-questions-about-meghan-markle-prince-harry-s-royal-wedding-t125076", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding is coming up!
