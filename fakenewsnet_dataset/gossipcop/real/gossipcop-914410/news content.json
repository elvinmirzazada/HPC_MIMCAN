Winona Ryder, for example, couldn't hear parts of an acceptance speech while on stage with the cast of Stranger Things at the SAG Awards, leading her to make faces that people interpreted as, well, strange \u2014 but people didn't know the reasonable explanation until later. And Dakota Johnson was recently said to be side-eyeing Angelina Jolie during Jennifer Aniston's Golden Globes speech, but the Fifty Shades actress explained that she really was trying to get a good look at her favorite actors from Stranger Things, who were seated at another table.\n\nSuch is the case with Zendaya, who some thought was scowling at Blake Lively and Emily Blunt while they were all sitting together at the Michael Kors runway show at New York Fashion Week.\n\nExcept she wasn't. She was just trying to get a good look at the fashion!\n\n\"I was looking at the runway,\" she tweet-shouted.\n\nNow that's cleared up.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/07/robyn-dixon-skincare-business.jpg?itok=HYmaLIBv", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-021618-zendaya-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/themes/custom/reality/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/Erika-Jayne.jpg?itok=Y2WJV_vf", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/04/alexia-nepola-frankie-rosello-wwhl.jpg?itok=PvjMMiiN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/344/763/150528_2869630_Gag_Award__Katy__Rihanna__or_Zendaya_.jpg?itok=ms5Ky2oG", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/scale_600/public/dish-021618-zendaya-01.jpg?itok=Yv69aTSN"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-021618-zendaya-promote.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/zendaya-at-new-york-fashion-week-wasnt-scowling-at-blake-lively-and-emily-blunt", "title": "NYFW: Zendaya Didn't Scowl at Blake Lively and Emily Blunt", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1133952, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Zendaya Didn't Scowl at Blake Lively and Emily Blunt at NYFW\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/02\\/dish-021618-zendaya-promote.jpg?itok=VegqBvCv\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/02\\/dish-021618-zendaya-promote.jpg?itok=737M4bUI\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/02\\/dish-021618-zendaya-promote.jpg?itok=izwO84r0\",\"70x70\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/fp_scale_crop_70x70\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/02\\/dish-021618-zendaya-promote.jpg?itok=81Nh-yC6\"}}", "description": "Award shows and other high-profile events are fertile grounds for taking and then misinterpreting screenshots and video clips of people's facial expressions.", "og": {"site_name": "Bravo TV Official Site", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/zendaya-at-new-york-fashion-week-wasnt-scowling-at-blake-lively-and-emily-blunt", "title": "Zendaya Explains Her Facial Expressions at a New York Fashion Week Show | Bravo TV Official Site", "description": "Award shows and other high-profile events are fertile grounds for taking and then misinterpreting screenshots and video clips of people's facial expressions.", "image": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-021618-zendaya-promote.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-16T15:23:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2023-10-19T03:49:05-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1592250694320227}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Award shows and other high-profile events are fertile grounds for taking and then misinterpreting screenshots and video clips of people's facial expressions.", "site": "@bravotv", "title": "Zendaya Explains Her Facial Expressions at a New York Fashion Week Show | Bravo TV Official Site", "url": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/zendaya-at-new-york-fashion-week-wasnt-scowling-at-blake-lively-and-emily-blunt", "image": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-021618-zendaya-promote.jpg"}, "Generator": "Drupal 9 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "vertical_name": "The Daily Dish"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518812580.0, "source": "http://www.bravotv.com", "summary": ""}
