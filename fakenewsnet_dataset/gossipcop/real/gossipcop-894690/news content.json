Thanks Sarah. I felt like a princess and superwoman all at once,\u201d she captioned the photo below.\n\nIn addition to her strapless, belted gown, Williams sparkled thanks to jewelry by XIV Karats, worth $3.5 million in total.\n\nMeanwhile, her groom wore an Armani suit at the f\u00eate, which was planned by Jennifer Zabinski of JZ Events.\n\nBob Metelus and Erica Rodriguez/Vogue Magazine\n\nBefore Williams walked down the aisle, her bridesmaids all wore custom Galia Lahav dresses.\n\n\u201cShe talked to all of us and just kind of let us have creative control as to what dress fit our personality. And then she approved it, of course!\u201d Serena\u2019s best friend, Val Vogt, told Vogue.\n\nThe new parents to daughter Alexis Ohanian Jr. wed in an intimate ceremony in New Orleans, Louisiana, in front of guests including Beyonc\u00e9, LaLa Anthony and Kim Kardashian West.\n\nAnd Williams changed into a second wedding look for the reception! The star looked gorgeous in a white strapless Versace dress that featured lace and feathers throughout the bodice.\n\n\u201cThey worked nonstop to make sure the tiniest details were perfectly taken care of, for a total of 1,500 hours,\u201d designer Donatella Versace told Vogue about the reception dress.\n\nThe couple began dating in 2015, revealed their engagement in December 2016, and exchanged vows less than three months after the birth of their first child together, who was born on September 1st.\n\n\n\nWilliams\u2019 wedding dress was no doubt a design she\u2019s been dreaming about for a long time. In September 2016, the champion athlete launched her third Signature Statement collection for HSN, and told PEOPLE that her passion for clothing is something that sparked during her childhood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sewing my whole life. My mom taught me when I was young,\u201d she told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cI used to make clothes for my dolls. Then, when I finished high school, I went to fashion school.\u201d\n\nBob Metelus and Erica Rodriguez//Vogue Magazine\n\nWilliams attended the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale like her older sister Venus, 36, and the sisters continue to help each other with their designs.\n\n\u201c[Venus] is always looking at my sketches and is like, \u2018I like that so much!\u2019 and actually, I\u2019m always at her office hanging out,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re always designing, and I\u2019m like, \u2018oh, I like that fabric better!\u2019 We\u2019re not competitive, it\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nWiliams even revealed to PEOPLE she has hopes to launch a wedding dress collection one day.\n\n\u201cMy dream is to do evening-wear and wedding dresses,\u201d Williams said in 2016. \u201cIn school, I realized how much work that was, so at the end of school, I just got really smart and was like, evening wear is so intricate, and I love things that an everyday woman can wear and still feel good and look good, so I started [there]. But there\u2019s still that evening-wear dream, you know?\u201d\n\nWhat do you think of her wedding look?
