In a new interview with Byrdie Beauty, the Pretty Little Liars star reveals that after years of being in the Hollywood party scene, she decided to quit drinking. \u201cI\u2019m just always trying to surround myself with better people and be the best version of myself possible,\u201d she says. \u201cI know it sounds obnoxious to hear people say that, but why not?\u201d In place of the drink for Lucy these days: quality time with her dog, watching Big Little Lies (great choice), podcasts, and SoulCycle, which she says she signed up for after watching an episode of PLL some years ago. \u201cI went through a phase that was almost like my freshman 15,\u201d she tells Byrdie. \u201cIt\u2019s so weird to see your weight fluctuate on a TV show.\u201d\n\nLucy as Aria Montgomery on season six of Pretty Little Liars. Disney ABC Television Group\n\nLucy, who will officially say goodbye to Aria and company when PLL airs its series finale in June, also opens up about the struggles she had when the show first started. She tried to be the social butterfly but discovered it wasn\u2019t her style. \u201cBecoming a part of this popular show \u2026 everyone just says yes to you, so you get away with a lot, and then you make mistakes.\u201d She also tried to blend in with her co-stars. \u201cIt was hard being on a show with a bunch of tall girls. I just always felt like the odd one out.\u201d She tells Byrdie that it wasn\u2019t until recently that she figured things out. It all started with a visit to salon. \u201cI know it seems silly because it\u2019s just hair. But at a point, I was like, \u2018Why don\u2019t I just own that I\u2019m different?' I guess cutting my hair off was like me finally saying, \u2018I don\u2019t give a fuck.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the full interview, which includes an excellent photo spread, head over to Byrdie.\n\nFollow
