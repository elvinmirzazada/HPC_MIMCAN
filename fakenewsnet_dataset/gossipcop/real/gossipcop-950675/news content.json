The first photo is of one of the camera monitors revealing Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson) in a moment of celebration. See? Watson wasn't lying that Beth is alright. Everyone can take a sigh of relief.\n\nWe don't know yet exactly when Season 3 of This Is Us will pick up with the Pearsons, but it looks like the first scene might be a little while after (or before) Kate's (Chrissy Metz) wedding if Beth and Randall are jubilant instead of freaking out about their ruined car.\n\nThis Is Us: Will Kevin's Vietnam Trip Lead to Another Big Mystery?\n\nTheir co-star Mandy Moore told TV Guide that Season 3 will be the show's most ambitious yet and will feature stand-out episodes for both Beth and Toby (Chris Sullivan). The season will also explore Jack's (Milo Ventimiglia) time in Vietnam as well as what his relationship with Rebecca was like before they had the Big 3.\n\nThis Is Us returns Tuesday, Sept. 25 at 9/8c on NBC.", "images": ["https://i-cmg-amlg-prod.appspot.com/display?id=a8beca15-96a8-4770-abaa-cbc85354c2da", "https://www.tvguide.com/a/img/hub/2018/02/20/9882d040-d0ff-4d26-a767-f674300bc563/180220-thisisussterlingkbrown-news.jpg", "https://www.tvguide.com/a/img/resize/ff98460ea52ff93d461aa94ccbe2b5b622585e33/hub/2015/11/12/7757667f-a65f-4449-be9c-02197213cf71/93407049313130463381390783152n.jpg?auto=webp&height=84&width=84"], "top_img": "https://www.tvguide.com/a/img/hub/2018/02/20/9882d040-d0ff-4d26-a767-f674300bc563/180220-thisisussterlingkbrown-news.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Vick", "July", "At P.M.
