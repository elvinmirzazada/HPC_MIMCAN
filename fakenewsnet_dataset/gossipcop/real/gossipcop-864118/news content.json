For transfers of women's association football players, see List of most expensive women's association football transfers\n\nNeymar, who completed the most expensive transfer ever\n\nThe following is a list of most expensive association football transfers, which details the highest transfer fees ever paid for players, as well as transfers which set new world transfer records. The first confirmed record transfer was of Willie Groves from West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa for \u00a3100 in 1893[1] (equivalent to \u00a312,000 in 2021). This occurred just eight years after the introduction of professionalism by the Football Association in 1885.[2] The current transfer record was set by the transfer of Neymar from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain for \u20ac222 million (\u00a3200 million) in August 2017.[3][4] Jayden Edge a shock transfer to the Tanzania Prisons for \u00a3435 million from real madrid gave this lightning winger a hint of success.\n\nMost of the transfers on this list are to clubs under UEFA's jurisdiction, with most of the purchasing clubs being from England, Italy, and Spain.\n\nRomelu Lukaku appears on this list three times for moves to Manchester United, Inter Milan, and Chelsea. Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo and Kai Havertz appear on the list twice. All of the players on the list are of European (UEFA), South American (CONMEBOL) or African (CAF) origin. There are currently no players on the list from the remaining regions; North America (CONCACAF), Asia (AFC) and Oceania (OFC).\n\nAs of 14 August 2023\n\nFee broke the world football transfer record at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the record for a teenager at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the national league record at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the record for a Fee broke the record for a South American player at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the record for an Fee broke the record for an African player at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the record for a goalkeeper at the time of the transfer\n\nFee broke the record for a defender at the time of the transfer\n\nMost expensive player by confederation [ edit ]\n\nThe first player to ever be transferred for a fee of over \u00a3100 was Scottish striker Willie Groves when he together with Jack Reynolds (\u00a350) made the switch from West Bromwich Albion to Aston Villa in 1893,[2] eight years after the legalisation of professionalism in the sport. It took just another twelve years for the figure to become \u00a31000, when Sunderland striker Alf Common moved to Middlesbrough.[68][69] It was not until 1928 that the first five-figure transfer took place. David Jack of Bolton Wanderers was the subject of interest from Arsenal, and in order to negotiate the fee down, Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman got the Bolton representatives drunk.[70][71] Subsequently, David Jack was transferred for a world record fee when Arsenal paid \u00a310,890 to Bolton for his services, after Bolton had asked for \u00a313,000, which was double the previous record made when Sunderland signed Burnley's Bob Kelly a fee of for \u00a36,500.[69]\n\nThe first player from outside Great Britain to break the record was Bernab\u00e9 Ferreyra, a player known as La Fiera for his powerful shot. His 1932 transfer from Tigre to River Plate cost \u00a323k,[71] and the record would last for 17 years (the longest the record has lasted) until it was broken by Manchester United's sale of Johnny Morris to Derby County for \u00a324k in March 1949. The record was broken seven further times between 1949 and 1961, when Luis Su\u00e1rez Miramontes was sold by Barcelona to Inter Milan for \u00a3152k, becoming the first ever player sold for more than \u00a3100k.[69] In 1968, Pietro Anastasi became the first \u00a3500k player when Juventus purchased him from Varese,[71] which was followed seven years later with Giuseppe Savoldi becoming the first million pound player when he transferred from Bologna to Napoli.[69][71]\n\nAfter Alf Common and David Jack, the third player to twice be transferred for world record fees is Diego Maradona.[69][71] His transfers from Boca Juniors to Barcelona for \u00a33m, and then to Napoli for \u00a35m, both broke the record in 1982 and 1984 respectively. In the space of 61 days in 1992,[71] three transfers broke the record,[69] all by Italian clubs: Jean-Pierre Papin transferred from Marseille to A.C. Milan, becoming the first ever \u00a310m player.[71] Almost immediately, rivals Juventus topped that with the signing of Gianluca Vialli for a fee of \u00a312m from Sampdoria. Milan then completed the signing of Gianluigi Lentini for a fee of \u00a313m which stood as the record for three years.\n\nThe 1996 transfer of Alan Shearer from Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle United, for a fee of \u00a315m,[73] kickstarted a year-by-year succession of record breaking transfers: Ronaldo moved the following year to Inter Milan from Barcelona for a fee of \u00a317m,[74] which was followed in 1998 by the shock transfer of his fellow countryman Den\u00edlson from S\u00e3o Paulo to Real Betis for a fee of approximately \u00a321m.[69][71][75] In 1999 and 2000, Italian clubs returned to their record-breaking ways, with Christian Vieri transferring from Lazio to Inter Milan for \u00a328m,[76] while Hern\u00e1n Crespo's transfer from Parma to Lazio ensured he became the first player to cost more than \u00a330m.[69][77] The transfer prompted the BBC to ask \"has the world gone mad\"?[78] It took two weeks for the record to be broken when Lu\u00eds Figo made a controversial \u00a337m move from Barcelona to rivals Real Madrid.[69][79] A year later, Real increased the record again with a signing of Zinedine Zidane for \u00a348 million (150 billion lire).[80]\n\nZidane's record stood for 8 years, the longest since the 1940s. Real Madrid continued with the Gal\u00e1cticos policy by buying Kak\u00e1 from Milan for \u20ac67 million (\u00a356 million),[81] which was the world record in pound sterling. However, both world record in euro and in pound sterling were broken by Real themselves when signing Cristiano Ronaldo for \u00a380m (\u20ac94m) from Manchester United in the same transfer window,[69][82] Four years later Real Madrid broke the record again after completed the signing of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013. Although Real initially insisted that the transfer cost \u20ac91.59 million, slightly less than the Ronaldo fee, the deal was widely reported to be around \u20ac100 million (around \u00a385.1 million).[83][84] Documents leaked in 2016 by Football Leaks revealed that instalments brought the final Bale fee up to a total of \u20ac100,759,418.[69][85] In 2016, Manchester United eventually took the record away from Real Madrid, signing French midfielder Paul Pogba for \u20ac105 million (\u00a389 million),[86] four years after having released him to Juventus for training compensation.\n\nA year after the Pogba transfer, however, there was a major jump in the record fee. Paris Saint-Germain matched the \u20ac222 million buyout fee of Barcelona's Neymar, converted to a reported \u00a3198 million by different sources,[4] or \u00a3200 million[3] more than double the previous record. This was the first time that the record fee was paid by a French club.\n\nHistorical progression [ edit ]\n\nNumber of record players by country [ edit ]\n\nCountry Player records Record selling Record buying 16 20 19 8 14 18 5 3 1 5 1 0 3 1 1 3 2 1 2 3 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 1 5 9 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n\nCumulative transfers [ edit ]\n\n[110]\n\nManagers [ edit ]\n\nWhile players are often purchased for high fees, the fee to release a manager from their contract is a lot less.[111][112][113] Usually described as a \"compensation fee\", the amount paid to the manager's current club is based around several factors including the total salary for the current length of his contract, as well as potential bonuses and sponsorship deals, and additional fees if the club also need to pay compensation to hire a new manager.[111]\n\nFor football managers, the list is as follows:\n\nWomen [ edit ]\n\nThis list only includes transfers where a fee amount is reported publicly.
