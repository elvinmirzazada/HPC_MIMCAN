Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nPink has to thumb through a Wikipedia page on her phone detailing her album credits to remember all the songs she\u2019s written. After 17 years and seven albums \u2014 each of which she\u2019s written or co-written nearly every song \u2014 it\u2019s hard for her to keep track. \u201cOh fuck!\u201d she exclaims, recalling writing one. \u201cNope, not that,\u201d she says, wanting to forget another. \u201cThis is gonna take awhile. What have I done?\u201d she exhales the longer the list keeps going.\n\nWhen Pink was a teenager growing up outside Philly, she would journal lyrics as a means to cope with her parents\u2019 divorce; they\u2019re what eventually led to L.A. Reid signing her to LaFace Records before she even turned 18. At 38, she\u2019s still writing to process the traumas of both her interior life as well as the state of the world, but she often dulls the pain by writing songs that make room for escapism, hoping people will join her in getting out of their heads for however long they need.\n\nIt\u2019s why she tells Vulture she considers her latest hit \u201cWhat About Us\u201d \u201cone of the more sophisticated songs\u201d she\u2019s written yet \u2014 a song that takes a lighter approach to wading through darkness. Around the release of her new album, Beautiful Trauma, we asked Pink to look back at her nearly two-decade-long body of work and pick the best songs she\u2019s ever written.\n\n\u201cDear Mr. President,\u201d I\u2019m Not Dead (2006)\n\n\u201cI remember when I finished writing it, I knocked on the wall like, \u2018Is this thing on? Am I gonna get audited this year?\u2019 And I did! \u2026 I played [my dad] \u2018Dear Mr. President\u2019 back when I wrote it and I was really nervous to do it because he has strong opinions and so do I. He said, \u201cYou know honey, I\u2019m glad I fought for your right to say whatever you want.\u201d Because to him, to soldiers, they\u2019re fighting for your freedom to say what you want and be who you are. I appreciate that sentiment.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop Falling,\u201d Can\u2019t Take Me Home (2000)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s from my very first record. I wrote it all myself, basically, with the help of a piano player. I was 18. I loved singing that song, and I love that vocal. That was a young vocal [moment of mine] that I liked.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrystal Ball,\u201d Funhouse (2008)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know why. But, also [from that album], \u2018Glitter in the Air,\u2019 if we\u2019re talking performances.\u201d\n\n\u201cFamily Portrait,\u201d Missundaztood (2001)\n\n\u201cIt healed me, or a part of me, that might never have been healed. And it created an interesting experience with my family when I played it for them for the first time. There were a lot of tears for many days; it was like picking up the rug and getting the dust out. Really just ripping the band-aid off. For the first time as an adult, it was me talking to my parents about what [our life] was like as a kid. I had to apologize to my stepmom for the line \u2018I don\u2019t want a stepbrother anyways.\u2019 It was just a real and painful experience that I\u2019m glad we had.\u201d\n\n\u201cI Don\u2019t Believe You,\u201d Funhouse (2008)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever given my power away. It\u2019s very vulnerable saying, \u2018I don\u2019t believe that you don\u2019t want me anymore.\u2019 It\u2019s a very vulnerable thing for an alpha dog to sing. I had to swallow my pride. I did that a lot; that\u2019s how our marriage [with husband, Carey Hart] got back together. We both swallowed our pride. It\u2019s a good thing to do.\u201d", "images": ["https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/024/5b2/ed23e05210e1edbe7981cfd6afb86de6f3-australia-show-11-27-2023-lede.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/982/b94/389aeba42f960d003fbfdee30d55e413da-13-pink.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/982/b94/389aeba42f960d003fbfdee30d55e413da-13-pink.rsquare.w400.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1ef/d78/c6483531413874e8eacdd0a203bf8a486e-dee-lockett.2x.rsquare.w168.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/432/78a/817556d5a1a5ab358af1dca2d79eccaaae-Le-French-Diner-Matt-Morris.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/20b/fd3/7226659559afbbe7df4da2aa60aadbe3cd-my-brothers-ghost.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2e2/98e/99818d3d7a6a16d9c4b41dca7a9760ec10-2423Cov-4x5-CONFLICT.w240.jpg", "https://assets.nymag.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/982/b94/389aeba42f960d003fbfdee30d55e413da-13-pink.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dee Lockett", "A Senior Editor On The Culture Pages At New York"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/pink-picks-the-5-best-songs-shes-written.html", "title": "Pink Picks the 5 Best Songs She\u2019s Ever Written", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "pink, music, musicians on their own music, best songs, featuretype:feature", "og": {"title": "Pink Picks the 5 Best Songs She\u2019s Ever Written", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/pink-picks-the-5-best-songs-shes-written.html", "description": "Spoiler: Pink has a soft spot for her deep cuts.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/982/b94/389aeba42f960d003fbfdee30d55e413da-13-pink.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Pink Picks the 5 Best Songs She\u2019s Ever Written", "description": "Spoiler: Pink has a soft spot for her deep cuts.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/982/b94/389aeba42f960d003fbfdee30d55e413da-13-pink.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-13T22:00:59.944Z", "tag": "pink, music, musicians on their own music, best songs", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Pick picks her five best songs, from \u201cDear Mr. President\u201d to \u201cFamily Portrait.\u201d", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "pink, music, musicians on their own music, best songs", "author": "Dee Lockett", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "sectionOverride": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.vulture.com/media/sites/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507932059.944, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
