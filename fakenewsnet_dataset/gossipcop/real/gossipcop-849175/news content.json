They\u2019re both devout Yankee fans, dedicated parents, and career-driven celebs. But there\u2019s just one area of their relationship where we weren\u2019t sure that A-Rod could keep up: the dance floor.\n\nJ.Lo is arguably the best dancer of her generation, launching a new TV show, World of Dance, later this month, all about her love of dance. \u201cObviously I started as a dancer, I know what that feels like to just love to dance. There are so many moments like that on the show and so much amazing death-defying tricks and dancing. It\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s everything I wanted it to be,\u201d she told the Today show Monday morning.\n\nSo does her new boyfriend share the same affection for the craft? \u201cHe\u2019s a good dancer. He has a great time. Again, one of the things that I love is that he loves to dance and I love to dance,\u201d she said, making the hosts think that she was dancing around the question of whether he could keep up.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say he couldn\u2019t dance. I never said that. No, he can dance. Merengue, he dances all the important stuff for me. When the Spanish music comes on \u2026\u201d she said, putting our fears to rest that A-Rod can likely salsa with the best of them, too.\n\nLopez also weighed in on which couple nickname she prefers. For the record, it\u2019s J-Rod. \u201cI figured something like that would happen,\u201d she said. But as for A.Lo? \u201cDon\u2019t like that as much.\u201d\n\nGetty\n\nRELATED: Here's a Smitten J.Lo Blowing a Kiss at A-Rod\n\nThe verdict is in, you guys.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/04/040417-lena-dunham.jpg?itok=PrZfPOlI", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/05/050817-millie-bobbie-brown-emma-watson-lead.jpg?itok=7hElrCZ4", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2017/05/050817-arod-jlo-lead.jpg?itok=Wp7HJ3oy", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/05/050817-arod-jlo-lead.jpg?itok=tJop6C4u", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/05/050817-harry-styles-sign-of-the-times.jpg?itok=k5XvVE9l", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/05/050317-mani-monday-lead.jpg?itok=bk7AIOPn", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/150x180/public/images/2017/05/050817-kendall-jenner.jpg?itok=aP3wpAm1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/150x180/public/images/2017/05/050817-chrissy-metz.jpg?itok=ObA94csf", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/05/050817-john-legend-chrissy-teigen.jpg?itok=yWEpp5ea", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/05/050817-kennedy-award-obama.jpg?itok=HI9FbAqV", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/05/050817-best-social-media-moments-hailee-steinfeld.jpg?itok=2ulbLDdr", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/150x180/public/1494254928/050817-Secrets-to-Queen-Elizabeth-and-Prince-Philips-Marriage-LEAD.jpg?itok=zwiRYmkx", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1381046852207528&ev=PixelInitialized", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/05/050717-lindsaylohan-lead.jpg?itok=_o4FsEkZ", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_round_red_32.png", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsQAAA7EAZUrDhsAAAANSURBVBhXYzh8+PB/AAffA0nNPuCLAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1036056483/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/05/050817-arod-jlo-lead.jpg?itok=tJop6C4u", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165536/http://www.instyle.com/news/jennifer-lopez-talks-alex-rodriguez-dancing-ability", "title": "Is A-Rod a Good Dancer?
