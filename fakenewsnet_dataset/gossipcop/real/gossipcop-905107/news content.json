And unlike those who take the vow, guests can even get married at the mindbogglingly impressive locale.\n\nLapland's website reveals that the annual SnowVillage is crafted using \"20 million kilos of snow and 350 thousand kilos of ice,\" bringing together artists from Russia, Poland, Latvia and Ukraine to adorn the hotel. Guests this year are treated to dragons, not unlike Daenerys Targaryen's beloved children on the show, an icy Iron Throne and even an eerie recreation of the Hall of Faces.\n\nYou can book a room until April 8, which is a lot earlier than Game of Thrones' final season return in 2019. So, if you're fandom rises above the rest -- and you happen to have the cold tolerance of a wildling -- make your reservations, while you can.\n\nCheck out photos from the SnowVillage Instagram page to see this year's Thrones-themed creations.\n\nThe most remarkable part of this is that this entire hotel was crafted in a matter of months while we've been waiting for years for George R.R. Martin to finish the damn books.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2Fgame_of_thrones_season_6_finale.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2017-08/1280_gotcleanedup_getty.jpg?width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2F1280_snowvillage-thrones-2017-2018-whitewalker-00001.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-12%2F1_0.png%3Fh%3D30cf76bb&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_snowvillage-thrones-2017-2018-whitewalker-00001.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2Fjason_momoa_emilia_clarke_gettyimages-136957322.jpg%3Fh%3D02fd1b3e&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_snowvillage-thrones-2017-2018-whitewalker-00001.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/game-thrones-hotel-made-entirely-ice-erected-finland-see-pics-94026", "title": "'Game of Thrones' Hotel Made Entirely of Ice Erected in Finland -- See the Pics", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_snowvillage-thrones-2017-2018-whitewalker-00001.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Lapland Hotels teamed up with HBO Nordic for the extravagant \"SnowVillage,\" a destination of Ice (but no Fire).", "title": "'Game of Thrones' Hotel Made Entirely of Ice Erected in Finland -- See the Pics", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/game-thrones-hotel-made-entirely-ice-erected-finland-see-pics-94026", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Lapland Hotels teamed up with HBO Nordic for the extravagant \"SnowVillage,\" a destination of Ice (but no Fire).", "twitter": {"description": "Lapland Hotels teamed up with HBO Nordic for the extravagant \"SnowVillage,\" a destination of Ice (but no Fire).", "title": "'Game of Thrones' Hotel Made Entirely of Ice Erected in Finland -- See the Pics", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/game-thrones-hotel-made-entirely-ice-erected-finland-see-pics-94026", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_snowvillage-thrones-2017-2018-whitewalker-00001.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "'Game of Thrones' Hotel Made Entirely of Ice Erected in Finland -- See the Pics | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, Game Of Thrones", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
