In the videos, Garner cooks a real meal, and provides the recipe in the caption. Typically, a long version of the cooking lesson is shared to her IGTV page.\n\nIna Garten's Barefoot Contessa: Cook Like a Pro Thanksgiving Special airs Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on the Food Network.\n\nFor more from the actress on her upcoming Turkey Day special.
