Allen Wayne Miller plowed through the front of 1902 Alexander Ave, which happens to be a home featured on the third season of HGTV's Fixer Upper show.\n\nHere's the home as it appeared after its makeover from Chip and Joanna Gaines:\n\nHGTV / Rachel Whyte\n\nNicknamed the \"Three Little Pigs\" house, the property belongs to Ken and Kelly Downs. While no one was seriously injured in the crash, Miller's car broke through the exterior wall of the house and then into Ken's study area, which looked in better times like the below:\n\nHGTV / Rachel Whyte\n\nAccording to the Waco Tribune-Herald, the Downses have raised concern about reckless driving in the neighbor before.\n\nIn a statement, Waco assistant fire chief Don Yeager assessed the property's damage:\n\nThe yard is built up several feet, and he hit the embankment of the yard, apparently went airborne, and like a lot of older homes, this house was built up off the ground, so he cleared the rest of the yard. He didn\u2019t hurt the hedges, but he took out the railing on the porch and went right into the window of the front room and hit an interior wall that might be a load-bearing wall.\n\nFollow Lilian
