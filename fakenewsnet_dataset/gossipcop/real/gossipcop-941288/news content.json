She said she and her husband, Marc Daly, \"will definitely be welcoming a boy or girl in late this year.\"\n\nMany didn't believe her due to her age, but the ultrasound appears to be proof it's on the up and up.\n\nKenya has been struggling to get pregnant since marrying Daly in 2017. She flew to Barbados in November for IVF treatment at a world-renowned fertility center.\n\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\nKenya's not saying yet how far along she is right now. She says the ultrasound was captured earlier in in her pregnancy.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/f9/16by9/2018/06/04/f9ccc977011a59a1a97be7ca39048d0a_xl.jpg",
