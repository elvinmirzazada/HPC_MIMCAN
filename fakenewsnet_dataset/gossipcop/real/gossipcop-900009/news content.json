And with the American College of Sports Medicine's annual survey, we're getting a look at what's going to be big this year. They've pinpointed the top fitness trends of 2018 to watch for, and chances are, if you haven't gotten in on any of them yet, you just might soon.\n\nPublished in the ACSM\u2019s Health & Fitness Journal, more than 4,000 fitness professionals (including trainers, exercise physiologists, and fitness directors) gave their thoughts on the trends they think will be big in 2018. The survey respondents represented organizations including the American College of Sports Medicine, American Council on Exercise, National Council on Strength and Fitness, and The Cooper Institute. The responses were international, too, coming from 41 countries across the world and nearly every continent.\n\nIn the survey, the ACSM made an important distinction between a trend and a fad to the participants. While a trend was defined as \u201ca general development or change in a situation or in the way that people are behaving,\" a fad was \"a fashion that is taken up with great enthusiasm for a brief period.\" (Shout-out to '80s Jazzercise and '90s Tae Bo.) For the purposes of this survey, the ACSM was interested in trends, which have more staying power. Survey respondents were asked to rank 40 potential fitness trends on a 10-point scale, where 1 was least likely to be a trend in 2018, and 10 was most likely to be a trend in 2018.\n\nHere are the top 10 fitness trends of 2018, according to the pros\u2014and what you need to know about each one.\n\n1. High-Intensity Interval Training\n\nHigh-intensity interval training (or HIIT) took the top spot in this year's survey (it was also number one in 2014). A HIIT training session involves bursts of maximum-effort, very hard work (typically about 20 to 90 seconds), followed by a period of low-intensity recovery. The goal is to recover enough that you can go hard again during your next work interval. If you're a beginner, you might have longer rest intervals, or work intervals that are challenging but not at maximum effort.", "images": ["https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/65455c969ca4778509a8d153/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/653fe8bb8ce90538d8d3f0e5/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6543f0dc16d1566ed34ff402/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/57e1f1ac431d338e64f83ffa/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/57f80ec2fb1e273f1c402a0f/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/hiit-workout-benefits.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/6545189245fb51b2242bd36b/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/655661f8d93059b820024c70/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/653ff7f9673a3159f9e2dd68/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/61f2b0cd898b9838f51324f7/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/65661078c71c253cf3f8ed57/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/653fcf83e43f6329ccc4a12a/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/57f80ec2fb1e273f1c402a0f/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/hiit-workout-benefits.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/656641b2de473ca8fe56c5de/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6557dafaa76d764356679808/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/57f80ec2fb1e273f1c402a0f/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/hiit-workout-benefits.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Alexa Tucker"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/biggest-fitness-trends-of-2018", "title": "The 10 Biggest Fitness Trends of 2018", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "The  American College of Sports Medicine's annual survey found the top fitness trends of 2018, according to professionals.
