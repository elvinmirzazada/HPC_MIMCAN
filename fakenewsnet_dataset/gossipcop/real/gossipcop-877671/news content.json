You can get stuck in the emotion of it\u2014and sometimes I do, and I get really angry. I\u2019ll get pissed off and stomp around the house. The anger comes from such a deep, real place for me. But my mother always said to me, \u201cIf you want something done, do it yourself.\u201d\n\nSo I started a production company five years ago to create more roles for women onscreen and behind the scenes. Today I have something like 23 projects in the works driven by great female characters of different ages and races. There is a film about an astronaut, a film about the entrepreneur who invented Barbie, and a film about the young, brave American girls who were the first women to serve alongside Special Ops in 2010 in Afghanistan. I think it\u2019s worth noting, I self-funded my production company for years. I think there\u2019s this fallacy that because I\u2019ve been an actor, people are going to hand me stuff. Nobody hands me anything. I\u2019ll wake up earlier; I\u2019ll stay up later. I will put my money where my mouth is. I have to read faster, and I respond quicker than other producers. I have to call and call and call executives until they say yes to my projects.\n\n\u201cI can tell that I\u2019m considered a player [as a producer] now because of the respect I get from studio heads. They call me back quicker.\u201d\n\nAfter the presidential election I wanted to do even more: What surprised me most was how divided women felt. So many women in our country clearly did not feel seen. So I started a new multi\u00admedia company, Hello Sunshine, in order to seek out women from all over the U.S., to hear about their joys and struggles, and encourage them to be storytellers in all kinds of mediums. I want to create more opportunity on a smaller level that translates to a higher level.\n\nAll we can do to create change is work hard. That\u2019s my advice: Just do what you do well. If you\u2019re a producer, you\u2019ve got to produce. If you\u2019re a writer, you\u2019ve got to write. If you\u2019re in corporate America, keep working hard to bust through the glass ceiling. If you want our voices to be represented in government\u2014and I think we\u2019re all getting behind that idea now\u2014encourage women to run and help them with their campaigns. If you are one of those people who has that little voice in the back of her mind saying, \u201cMaybe I could do [fill in the blank],\u201d don\u2019t tell it to be quiet. Give it a little room to grow, and try to find an environment it can grow in.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/654ae38f5546cd32d0448486/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a42f695fdabb483b05c6b2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-2b.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a42f399845bb5caf043188/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-2a.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/654ae6f6ea1e5e755db96b18/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/644e984c4fdf6cb7eda89993/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a4817d22e1ec7be19705e2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-social.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a42edc27c2f9352e015997/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-1.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a42f846746a8222b26ffe8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-2c.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a4382b27c2f9352e0159a5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-3.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a43cab9845bb5caf043194/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-4.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6536d964f048fcc5d93e24b9/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a42fa46746a8222b26ffea/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-2d.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a4817d22e1ec7be19705e2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-social.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Reese Witherspoon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/reese-witherspoon-october-2017-cover-interview", "title": "Reese Witherspoon Has Something to Say to Women About Ambition", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Reese Witherspoon covers 'Glamour' magazine's September 2017 issue and talks about capitalizing on the demand for women\u2019s stories and how to tell them in single medium.", "id": "599f164912565a2d1b2a4fb0", "keywords": "reese witherspoon", "news_keywords": "reese witherspoon", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "599f164912565a2d1b2a4fb0", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Reese Witherspoon covers 'Glamour' magazine's September 2017 issue and talks about capitalizing on the demand for women\u2019s stories and how to tell them in single medium.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a4386a9845bb5caf043192/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-lede.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a4386a9845bb5caf043192/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-lede.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The superstar gets candid about what it means to be a driven woman in a powerful new essay.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a4817d22e1ec7be19705e2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-social.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Reese Witherspoon: 'Run Away From a Man Who Can't Handle Your Ambition.
