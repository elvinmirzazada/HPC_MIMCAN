TMZ also posted footage recorded in October 2017 allegedly depicting Thompson kissing one woman while a different woman groped him at the Darna hookah lounge outside of Washington D.C.\n\n02 of 16 TRISTAN'S EX ADDRESSES THE DRAMA ON INSTAGRAM David Livingston/Getty; Jordan Craig/Instagram Thompson\u2018s ex, Jordan Craig, shared a not-so-cryptic Instagram post, appearing to address the allegations the NBA player had cheated on Kardashian. Craig shares 16-month-old son Prince Oliver with the athlete. Thompson and Kardashian began dating in September 2016 when Craig was still pregnant with Thompson\u2019s first child. Neither has confirmed if he met Kardashian while still in a relationship with Craig. \u201cIf you respect yourself and you respect others, you would never make light of the misfortune of anyone, nor would you feel indemnified when it comes at the expense of others,\u201d Craig shared on her Instagram Story less than an hour after video of Thompson appearing to get close to a woman that wasn\u2019t Kardashian surfaced. \u201cWishing peace for everyone.\u201d\n\n03 of 16 TRISTAN 'IS A SERIAL CHEATER' Splash News Online \u201cTristan has been consistently cheating on Khlo\u00e9,\u201d a source alleged to PEOPLE. \u201cHe\u2019s a serial cheater. And there will be more women to come out of the woodwork.\u201d \u201cFirst [ex-husband Lamar Odom] cheated on her and now Tristan,\u201d the insider said. \u201cShe\u2019s been through so much.\u201d\n\n04 of 16 KHLO\u00c9 & HER FAMILY ARE DEVASTATED Khloe Kardashian/Instagram The Kardashian-Jenner clan are crushed for the new mom, the source told PEOPLE: \u201cThey are heartbroken for Khlo\u00e9. They didn\u2019t realize how deceptive Tristan could really be.\u201d The friend of the family said the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star \u201cwas beyond head over heels\u201d with Thompson. \u201cHe was her everything. They had a life together. She honestly thought he treated her like gold, like a queen,\u201d the source said. \u201c[He] gave her everything, doted on her, told her how beautiful she was. To her, life was perfect. And it all just came crashing down.\u201d\n\n05 of 16 LAMAR ODOM 'FEELS TERRIBLE FOR KHLO\u00c9' Kevin Mazur/Getty This is not the first time the Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star has faced similar rumors. Before she was romantically linked to NBA boyfriend Thompson in September 2016, Kardashian dealt with allegations of extramarital affairs during her nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Lamar Odom. A source close to Odom told PEOPLE Now, \u201cLamar feels terrible for Khloe. He wasn\u2019t sure if he should reach out and see how she\u2019s doing. He feels for her.\u201d\n\n06 of 16 KRIS & KIM FLY OUT TO CLEVELAND TO BE WITH KHLO\u00c9 Steve Granitz/WireImage Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian West flew from Los Angeles to Cleveland, Ohio, to be by Kardashian's side for the birth of her baby girl, a source confirmed to PEOPLE. \u201cKris is in Cleveland now giving Khlo\u00e9 as much support as possible and Kim is also heading there as well,\u201d one insider said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to keep her emotionally stable. The whole family is beyond pissed at Tristan. The goal is to get Khlo\u00e9 out of there as fast as they can without jeopardizing the safety of the baby after she\u2019s arrived. Khlo\u00e9 just wants to be home.\u201d\n\n07 of 16 KHLO\u00c9 WILL MOST LIKELY STAY WITH TRISTAN Splash News Online Despite the allegations of infidelity \u2014 a source previously told PEOPLE that Thompson is \u201ca serial cheater\u201d \u2014 the insider says the mom is likely to stay with Thompson. \u201cShe\u2019s a hopeless romantic and she\u2019ll try to make this work. She tried forever to make it work with Lamar [Odom]. She\u2019s having a child with Tristan, and she\u2019s going to try to rebuild this,\u201d the source said. Added the source: \u201cKhlo\u00e9 could probably convince herself to get over the fact that he maybe, kind of, sort of, hooked up with some groupie while out on the road. But being so indiscreet about it and letting it get splashed all over the place and having it humiliate her? That\u2019s actually even worse.\u201d\n\n08 of 16 BFF KHADIJAH SUPPORTS KHLO\u00c9 One of Khlo\u00e9 Kardashiann\u2019s closest friends, Khadijah Haqq McCray, is coming to her defense in the wake of Thompson\u2018s cheating scandal. Haqq McCray, whose twin sister Malika Haqq is also best friends with Kardashian, took to Instagram on April 10 to share a supportive quote seemingly targeted at Thompson. \u201cThe best thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother \u2013John Wooden,\u201d read the post, which she captioned with a fist pump.\n\n09 of 16 KHLO\u00c9 LET TRISTAN INSIDE THE DELIVERY ROOM BACKGRID \u201cKhlo\u00e9 labored with [mom Kris Jenner] yesterday at the hospital. Tristan was there for the birth,\u201d a Keeping Up with the Kardashians source told PEOPLE on April 12. \u201cHe has practice today, but will spend as much time at the hospital as possible.\u201d \u201cEveryone is focused on what\u2019s best for their baby girl,\u201d the insider added. \u201cKhlo\u00e9 is being the bigger person and letting Tristan bond with their baby.\u201d\n\n10 of 16 KHLO\u00c9 & HER FAMILY WANTED TO GIVE TRISTAN THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT Splash According to a source, \u201ceveryone wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt: that he was set up, that the girl never even went into his room, that you can\u2019t tell what\u2019s really happening behind that hoodie in the club footage, that the girl leaned in to whisper something but knew her pal was filming and so she made it seem as much as possible like a kiss.\u201d And when the photos and videos first leaked, the insider said Thompson stuck to that storyline, telling Kardashian, that he was set up. \u201cBasically, I think it\u2019s what Tristan has been telling her: \u2018Babe, you know how groupies are, you know how they try to hang on me and follow me around and this isn\u2019t what it looks like,\u2019 \u201d said the family insider.\n\n11 of 16 KHLO\u00c9 WILL SOON HEAD TO L.A. Tristan Thompson/Instagram Kardashian had always intended to raise her little one in Cleveland, the city that Thompson has made his home as he plays for the Cavaliers. But news of his alleged infidelities during her pregnancy have changed that plan, a source told PEOPLE. The source said that Kardashian\u2019s team is in Ohio and already preparing to fly the reality star and her newborn daughter via private plane back to Los Angeles, where her famous family lives. \u201cThe goal is to get Khlo\u00e9 out of there as fast as they can without jeopardizing the safety of the baby after she\u2019s arrived,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cKhlo\u00e9 just wants to be home.\u201d\n\n12 of 16 KHLO\u00c9 HAS 'BASICALLY ALREADY FORGIVEN' TRISTAN Jason Miller/Getty; Kevin Mazur/Getty Kardashian has already put Thompson\u2019s alleged infidelity behind her, an insider told PEOPLE. \u201cShe\u2019s so incredibly happy that her baby is here, that she is big and strong and healthy and beautiful, and so right now Khlo\u00e9 truly has no other cares in the world. She isn\u2019t even mad at Tristan right now,\u201d the source continued. \u201cShe\u2019s basically already forgiven him,\u201d the source added. \u201cShe is in a bubble of love and peace and happiness right now, and everything that happened with Tristan is less about \u2018cheating\u2019 and more like, it was just a random drunken hookup that meant nothing and was kissing at most and didn\u2019t lead to anything else and was the fault of stupid groupies trying to trap him, and everybody just needs to move on.\u201d\n\n13 of 16 A FIFTH WOMAN IS LINKED TO TRISTAN Jerritt Clark/Getty Images On April 12, The Daily Mail published pictures of the NBA player hanging out with a woman named Tania hanging out in New York City on multiple occasions throughout the past few months, dining and partying together \u2014 though there are no images of them getting physical. She is the fifth woman identified in the cheating scandal, which broke when videos surfaced of the Cleveland Cavaliers power forward allegedly getting close to an unidentified woman at the PH-D Lounge in New York City over the previous weekend \u2014 while Kardashian was nine months pregnant.\n\n14 of 16 KHLO\u00c9 & TRISTAN ARE TAKING THINGS 'DAY BY DAY' AKM-GSI \u201cKhlo\u00e9 still hasn\u2019t made a decision about her relationship with him. They\u2019re not broken up yet,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \"It\u2019s such a tough call for her to make right now, and she\u2019s just taking it day by day.\u201d\n\n15 of 16 ROB IS 'FURIOUS' WITH TRISTAN Steven Lawton/WireImage; Brian To/Variety/REX/Shutterstock Though he has yet to publicly address the news, according to a source, Rob Kardashian is \"furious\" at Thompson for allegedly cheating on his sister throughout her pregnancy. \"Khlo\u00e9 has always been there for Rob and he hates that she was hurt \u2014 he knows what it feels like to be screwed over by someone you trusted,\u201d a source told PEOPLE of Rob, who has an infamously rocky history with his ex, Blac Chyna. Added the source: \u201cRob won\u2019t forgive Tristan for this.\u201d", "images":
