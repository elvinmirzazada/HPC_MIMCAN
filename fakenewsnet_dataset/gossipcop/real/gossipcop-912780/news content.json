I think most people \u2014 we\u2019re intrinsically trying to control our experience here, and manage it, and put walls around what we are and who we are. I want to know as much of the garden as possible before I pass \u2014 I have an openness to any impulses that may arise within me at any time.\u201d\n\nHelen Maybanks\n\nHe continues, \u201cBut, if I were to identify, I would identify as heterosexual, and being someone who identifies that way, and who\u2019s taking on this seminal role, my scariest thought was, \u2018Am I allowed to do this?\u2019 \u201d\n\nWATCH: Andrew Garfield Faces Backlash After Saying \u2018I Am a Gay Man Right Now Just Without the Physical Act\u2019\n\nIn the play, The Amazing Spider-Man star plays Prior Walter, a gay man battling the reality of AIDS during the height of the 1980s crisis that killed hundreds of thousands in the gay community. The actor sparked backlash from the LGBT community in July 2017 when he was starring in the London production of the play and stated that he was a\u201cgay man right now, just without the physical act.\u201d\n\nGarfield later said his comments were \u201ctwisted\u201d and \u201ctaken out of context,\u201d clarifying that he was referring to how he was immersed in gay culture while preparing for the role.\n\n\u201cI think part of what I was trying to say was about inclusion, and about that openness to my impulses,\u201d he said.\n\nAngels in America opens on Broadway March 25.", "images":
