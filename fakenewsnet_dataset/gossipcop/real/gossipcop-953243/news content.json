{"url": "https://www.thewrap.com/second-act-film-review-jennifer-lopez/", "text": "Say what you will about Jennifer Lopez, but one thing is true: She takes risks. Never sticking to a particular type, she has run the gamut in her choice of films from romantic comedies (\u201cThe Wedding Planner,\u201d \u201cMaid in Manhattan,\u201d \u201cMonster-in-Law\u201d) to thrillers (\u201cThe Cell,\u201d \u201cAnaconda\u201d) to biopics (\u201cEl Cantante,\u201d \u201cSelena\u201d) and beyond. \u201cSecond Act\u201d is her first live-action film since 2015\u2019s \u201cThe Boy Next Door,\u201d and it feels like a confused puppy, caught between a stale script and a very confused storyline that frequently loses focus.\n\nMaya (Jennifer Lopez) is a big-box store assistant manager who has goals. She wants to wow her boss (Larry Miller) in the hopes of getting a well-deserved promotion to general manager. Instead, he introduces her to the white guy (Dan Bucatinsky) with an Ivy League MBA he hired for the position. Why? Because she isn\u2019t a college grad, and no matter how many years she has put into the store, how loved she is by her co-workers, or how much money she\u2019s made them, no degree means no promotion.\n\nHer best friend Joan (Leah Remini) provides a shoulder to cry on while simultaneously pushing her to marry (and have a family with) boyfriend Trey (Milo Ventimiglia), from whom she is hiding a big secret. Joan\u2019s Stanford-bound son, meanwhile, gifts his godmother Maya a fake r\u00e9sum\u00e9, complete with LinkedIn and Facebook accounts, as well as photoshopped pictures of a more educated and worldly version of herself. All this lands her a job interview at a major beauty brand in Manhattan where she must compete with the much younger and more business-savvy Zoe (Vanessa Hudgens).\n\nThis is the sort of story Hollywood drools over, an underdog rising to the top using a little white lie and her wits to make it. But writers Elaine Goldsmith and Justin Zackham (\u201cThe Bucket List\u201d) decided to overstuff the script with narratives that go absolutely nowhere. Wanting to make a statement about women in the workplace, while fixating on a pro-college ideology, Goldsmith and Zackham decide to throw in an adoption story, an odd statement on the beauty industry and (yes, there\u2019s another \u201cand\u201d) a romance on the rocks. Through each storyline pivot, the focus is lost, and it never reclaims any footing it may have had in the first place.\n\nHere\u2019s what the writers don\u2019t seem to realize: Lopez is the queen of charm (just take a look at her recent appearance on \u201cEllen\u201d for proof), and had they given her a consistent character along with the chance to let her comedic chops fly, this film could have been part of the rom-com renaissance that\u2019s currently being ushered in by other films like \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before,\u201d \u201cBook Club\u201d and \u201cCrazy Rich Asians.\u201d\n\nRemini, Ventimiglia and Hudgens are all wasted here, though each does what they can with the tropes they are given. While I really enjoyed Remini\u2019s scenes and her on-point wit, the sudden jump from supportive bestie to hyper-aggressive matchmaker was strange and misguided. Meanwhile, Ventimiglia is just Jack Pearson 2.0 \u2014 still endearing, but don\u2019t we see this every week? And while Hudgens gets to be both cunning and vulnerable, her character\u2019s story just doesn\u2019t fit the scope of the film.\n\nThe one thing the film does get right? The fashion. Costume designer Molly Rogers knows a thing or two about creating the ultimate New York fantasy look, having worked on \u201cSex and the City\u201d in its TV and two big-screen incarnations. Lopez is a fashionista in her own right, and it\u2019s hard to imagine that the actress (and producer) didn\u2019t have a hand in picking out all the gorgeous outfits on display. These are the ensembles every woman imagines when she dreams of making it big \u2014 Chanel, Louboutins and much more \u2014 and whether realistic or not, the movie successfully sells the fantasy.\n\nBecause, after all, we don\u2019t flock to see a rom-com or an underdog story for the realism; we do it because we want to get lost in a beautiful, witty romance, whether that means falling in love with a partner, a platonic friend, or ourselves. Even on that front, \u201cSecond Act\u201d is a letdown, serving up a bland, befuddled version of a big-budget Lifetime film. Lopez deserves better, and so do her fans.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/second-act-SECOND_Unit_01644R_rgb-1.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/second-act-SECOND_Unit_01644R_rgb-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fargo-juno-temple-sienna-king-fx.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mary-Testa.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fear-the-walking-dead-kim-dickens-amc-seth-f-johnson.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1_HellsKitchen_0023rR.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/second-act-SECOND_Unit_01644R_rgb-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Yolanda Machado", "Robert Hofler", "Bob Strauss", "Michel Ghanem", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/second-act-film-review-jennifer-lopez/", "title": "\u2018Second Act\u2019 Film Review: Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Charm Squandered in Tired Rom-Com", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Second Act' Film Review: Jennifer Lopez's Charm Squandered in Tired Rom-Com - TheWrap", "description": "The genre is having a resurgence, not that you could tell from this clich\u00e9d collection of worn-out tropes and muddled storytelling", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/second-act-film-review-jennifer-lopez/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/second-act-SECOND_Unit_01644R_rgb-1.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-12-20T14:00:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-12-20T13:35:36+00:00"}, "author": "Yolanda Machado", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Yolanda Machado", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "4 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "\u2018Second Act\u2019 Film Review: Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Charm Squandered in Tired Rom-Com", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/second-act-film-review-jennifer-lopez/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-12-20T06:00:44-08:00", "parsely-section": "reviews", "parsely-author": "Yolanda Machado", "parsely-tags": "dan_bucatinsky, elaine-goldsmith, jennifer_lopez, justin_zackham, larry-miller, leah_remini, milo_ventimiglia, movie_reviews, second-act, vanessa_hudgens", "article-tags": "dan_bucatinsky, elaine-goldsmith, jennifer_lopez, justin_zackham, larry-miller, leah_remini, milo_ventimiglia, movie_reviews, second-act, vanessa_hudgens}", "article-section": "reviews", "article-categories": "movies, reviews", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/YsVo5necW6Q"], "publish_date": 1545314444.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
