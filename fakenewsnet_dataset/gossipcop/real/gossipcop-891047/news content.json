The legendary group of assassins were recruited by Ricardo Diaz (Kirk Acevedo) to exact his revenge on Oliver and the team after they took down his burgeoning criminal empire in season six.\n\nFinally, since Oliver finds himself locked up, some familiar faces will be back including Michael Jai White as Ben Turner/Bronze Tiger, Cody Runnels as Derek Sampson and Vinnie Jones Danny \u201cBrick\u201d Brickwell.\n\nThere has been no shortage of close calls for Oliver Queen when it comes to protecting his Super Hero identity, but in the season six finale, he was finally backed into a corner and forced to reveal himself to the world as the Green Arrow.

Oliver will find himself vulnerable in a way unlike ever before when a mysterious new enemy begins to unravel his work as Green Arrow, challenging him to redeem his name or risk losing everything.\n\nArrow stars Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen, David Ramsey as John Diggle, and Emily Bett Rickards as Felicity Smoak.
