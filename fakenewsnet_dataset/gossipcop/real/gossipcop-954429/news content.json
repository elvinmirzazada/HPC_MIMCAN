Dont send them any info. We r after them,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThroughout the day, Vergara\u2019s Instagram continued to post the same image of text encouraging users to follow a link in her Instagram Story for a free iPhone X, Apple Watch or gift card.\n\n\u201cHello guys! I am giving away 1000 FREE IPhone X\u2019s and Apple watches on my Instagram stories right now!!! Claim them before it\u2019s too late! Gracias Te amo,\u201d the post reads.\n\nThe post would appear for several minutes before being deleted and seemingly republished in its entirety.\n\nIf users clicked the star\u2019s Instagram Story, they were greeted with screens telling them to swipe up for a chance to win. If they did, they were met with a screen asking them to download a free app and input some information to verify their identity. It\u2019s unclear if any users have fallen into the hacker\u2019s trap. However, as of this writing the posts have finally gone away.\n\nVergara has yet to update fans on the situation.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/19408c91-2846-498f-8746-68c777431ca4/dc66da8e-d2ab-488b-9e20-23b2d396fc54/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/683a7afc-c45b-45d1-a66e-c2bf3c642000/eb427261-ddd9-47ac-b6b3-dc3323584be5/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/1b7923a2-2827-4275-b995-744d798cec60/2b91178d-146a-4dad-b944-0c6aa604b9bc/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/Royal_Family.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/sofia-vergara-ap.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/sofia-vergara-ap.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/560a8fea-9cd0-47f9-8178-596cc0e8d016/6905e13d-6013-4683-b922-023ad181ce11/1280x720/match/348/196/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/11/348/196/2ec327ae-Taylor_Swift_Travis_Kelce.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/vergara-hack.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1200/675/vergara-hack-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/NEWSLETTER_ENT-532x120.png"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/sofia-vergara-ap.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sofia-vergara-reveals-her-instagram-was-hacked-warns-fans-not-to-fall-for-scam", "title": "Sofia Vergara reveals her Instagram was hacked, warns fans not to fall for scam", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "description": "Sofia Vergara is warning fans not to fall for a giveaway that\u2019s being promoted on her Instagram after hackers gained access to the account.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Tyler McCarthy", "dc.title": "Sofia Vergara reveals her Instagram was hacked, warns fans not to fall for scam", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:23cee9b8-f444-5970-87b8-87e0dca7baff", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2018-07-24", "dcterms.created": "2018-07-24T10:43:24-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2018-07-24T10:57:41-04:00", "og": {"title": "Sofia Vergara reveals her Instagram was hacked, warns fans not to fall for scam", "description": "Sofia Vergara is warning fans not to fall for a giveaway that\u2019s being promoted on her Instagram after hackers gained access to the account.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/sofia-vergara-ap.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sofia-vergara-reveals-her-instagram-was-hacked-warns-fans-not-to-fall-for-scam", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Sofia Vergara reveals her Instagram was hacked, warns fans not to fall for scam", "description": "Sofia Vergara is warning fans not to fall for a giveaway that\u2019s being promoted on her Instagram after hackers gained access to the account.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/sofia-vergara-ap.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sofia-vergara-reveals-her-instagram-was-hacked-warns-fans-not-to-fall-for-scam"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/GENRES/Viral,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "viral,entertainment", "classification-tags": "viral,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
