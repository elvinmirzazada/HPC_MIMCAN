Finally a product that allowed us to skip showers without having the world know how lazy we are! You could practically hear the scalps of oily-haired girls rejoicing. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve taken things a bit far. We\u2019re misusing the product, and our hair is paying the price.\n\nWhen I went to visit Nunzio Saviano\u2018s salon for a new cut, he took one look at my hair and asked, \u201cHow often are you using dry shampoo?\u201d Apparently my dull color and rough texture were telltale signs that I\u2019d been hitting the bottle a little too often.\n\nSince my hair is pretty thick and incredibly hard to dry, I tend to wash it once every five days. To make the shampoo last, I spray a little dry shampoo onto my roots every morning. This, according to Saviano, is far too often. \u201cYou should only get a day out of your dry shampoo, and then wash,\u201d he says.\n\nSo why should dry shampoo be used so sparingly? As Saviano points out, it\u2019s not just baby powder inside those aerosol cans. Tons of chemicals are being sprayed onto your scalp, which clog the pores and don\u2019t let the scalp breathe. Think of it like nail polish. If you\u2019re wearing nail color 24/7, you\u2019re not letting your nails get any oxygen, which is why they can turn yellow. Scalps should be allowed to breathe as well.\n\nTo use dry shampoo correctly, only use on your last day of a blowout, and make sure to shampoo it out the following day.\n\nRead more: 6 New Ways to Use Dry Shampoo", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetabercrombiejeans.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Gordon-Ramsay-Hells-Kitchen-22.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DAYME-AROCENA.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/root-cover-up-fi.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kleemorganicseyecream.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ydiw_dry-shampoo-hp.png?w=320&h=360&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ydiw_dry-shampoo-hp.png", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lush-advent-cal.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ytp-eye-cream-fi.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Taylor-Swift.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/targetsweaterset.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/daisy-jones-and-the-six.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RemiBader_Homepage.webp?w=244", "https://static-dailymakeover.stylecaster.com/2014/01/ydiw_dry-shampoo-article.png", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nativaspa-cyber-monday.jpg?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/luke-mitchell-chicago-med.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://spy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sdfgve.png?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ulta-hair-sale.png?w=960&h=540&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/uggdupestarget.gif?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lush-advent-cal.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/olivercabellsneakersale.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bestprodsforthinninghair.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/rsz_squid_game__the_challenge_n_s1_e1_00_20_44_00r.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&resize=232,175"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ydiw_dry-shampoo-hp.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Segura"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/beauty/hair-nails/570502/dry-shampoo-mistakes/", "title": "You\u2019re Doing It Wrong: Dry Shampoo", "meta_data": {"description": "See the major dry shampoo mistake you've been making.", "msvalidate.01": "7A34A1C1904BAFB83691E8B3718CA9A2", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/stylecaster", "published_time": "2014-01-28T18:30:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-03T21:57:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "yB_5UwT5pPNnn93Mba5HIaFkNtbrafDQWP_Rj34Iw08", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "author": "Megan Segura", "tags": "dry shampoo, hair tips, You're Doing it Wrong", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "You\u2019re Doing It Wrong: Dry Shampoo", "url": "https://stylecaster.com/beauty/hair-nails/570502/dry-shampoo-mistakes/", "description": "We\u2019re all guilty of this dry shampoo mistake.", "site_name": "StyleCaster", "image": {"identifier": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ydiw_dry-shampoo-hp.png", "width": 320, "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"site": "@StyleCaster", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "You\u2019re Doing It Wrong: Dry Shampoo", "description": "See the major dry shampoo mistake you've been making.", "image": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ydiw_dry-shampoo-hp.png?w=320"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/sc-favicon.png?w=67", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1390933827.0, "source": "https://stylecaster.com", "summary": ""}
