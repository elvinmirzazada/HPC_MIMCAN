My highest hope for her is just that she has the fearlessness to always be her authentic self, no matter what she thinks men want her to be.\"\n\nTatum then adorably explained how, after meeting his wife, Jenna Dewan Tatum, he remained uncertain about the future of their relationship, despite feeling a powerful connection.\n\nIt wasn't until the gorgeous dancer and actress suddenly spoke up about wanting to spend the rest of her life with him, that Tatum realized he had found the one.\n\n\"Jenna just blurted out that she knew exactly what she wanted in life and she didn't have to look for it anymore because it was me,\" Tatum recalled. \"She had no idea what I'd say or how I'd react, but that was her truth. I remember feeling this incredible rush -- it was the sexiest thing she'd ever done for me. I felt strength, because in that moment, she had accepted every part of me, the good and the bad.\"\n\n\"That radical authenticity of hers was what made me fall head over heels in love,\" the actor continued. \"Before I experienced it, I wouldn't have known how to ask for it. Now I know it's what I was always craving. And that's what I want for my daughter -- to be expectation-less with her love and not allow preconceived standards to affect her, to ask herself what she wants and feel empowered enough to act on it.\"\n\nWATCH: Jenna Dewan Tatum Says Daughter Everly Knows 'Magic Mike' Moves\n\nTatum added that he hopes more women will start to realize their worth and feel empowered in their approach to love.\n\n\"If there's one thing that I think men wish women knew, it's just that they alone are enough,\" he wrote. \"When more women start to truly feel this power in themselves, the world will become so magical, it makes my head hurt.\"\n\nSee more on Tatum's gorgeous little girl below.\n\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\n\nWatch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View, available now on iOS and Android.\n\nRelated Articles", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ah.zH2Cz3o7dYIXtOmd7Xw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTUwO2g9NDg-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/07b8d210-243d-11eb-bbff-617af51ac603", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/google-play-icon@3x.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YIHDmoE5_.hQNAPy_PVSmQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/654daf9202c7c145deff6aa671c04b84", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_sports_en-US_h_p_sports_2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190724/app-store-icon@3x.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Odw32apqCCHu2WV41.oLLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/654daf9202c7c145deff6aa671c04b84", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=2716427&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fchanning-tatum-pens-powerful-letter-013800876.html&c14=-1"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Odw32apqCCHu2WV41.oLLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/654daf9202c7c145deff6aa671c04b84", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leena Tailor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/channing-tatum-pens-powerful-letter-013800876.html", "title": "Channing Tatum Pens Powerful Letter for Daughter Everly & Shares the One Thing Men Wish Women Knew", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "news_keywords": "Channing  Tatum, Jenna Dewan Tatum, Everly", "twitter": {"title": "Channing Tatum Pens Powerful Letter for Daughter Everly & Shares the One Thing Men Wish Women Knew", "description": "The actor got candid about matters of love and sex while penning a letter for 'Cosmopolitan.'", "site": "@YahooSports", "dnt": "on", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Odw32apqCCHu2WV41.oLLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/654daf9202c7c145deff6aa671c04b84", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Odw32apqCCHu2WV41.oLLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/654daf9202c7c145deff6aa671c04b84"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"title": "Channing Tatum Pens Powerful Letter for Daughter Everly & Shares the One Thing Men Wish Women Knew", "url": "http://sports.yahoo.com/news/channing-tatum-pens-powerful-letter-013800876.html", "description": "The actor got candid about matters of love and sex while penning a letter for 'Cosmopolitan.'", "type": "article", "site_name": "Yahoo Sports", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Odw32apqCCHu2WV41.oLLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/654daf9202c7c145deff6aa671c04b84", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "al": {"android": {"url": "ysportacular://v2/news/details?articleUuid=fdd30ab8-bb21-3612-8486-c6f8100a64f9&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo Sports", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.sportacular"}, "ios": {"url": "ysportacular://v2/news/details?articleUuid=fdd30ab8-bb21-3612-8486-c6f8100a64f9&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo Sports", "app_store_id": 286058814}}, "description": "The actor got candid about matters of love and sex while penning a letter for 'Cosmopolitan.'"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://sports.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
