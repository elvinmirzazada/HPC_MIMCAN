Thanks for always having my back @mrdrewscott :) #happybirthday ?,\" he wrote.\n\nDrew, meanwhile, shared a snap of Jonathan singing into a paint roller. \"Retweet to wish the best brother in the world a big #HappyBirthday ???,\" he tweeted. \"@MrSilverScott thanks for making me laugh every day these past 40 years\u2764\ufe0f???? #twinning.\" The pair's network also shared a few throwback pics in a happy birthday post.\n\nTheir 40th birthday isn't the only big event the brothers are celebrating this year. In November, Drew told ET all about his upcoming spring wedding with Linda Phan.\n\n\"To be honest, our lives are always busy. But nothing is ever going to let me slow down on tying the knot with the woman that I love,\" he gushed. \"We don't want to slow down.\"\n\n\"We've narrowed down the location. We're doing a wedding in Europe, but we haven't exactly picked a final city yet,\" he continued. \"Once we do, then everyone will hear about it!\"\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-12%2Fgettyimages-822840398.jpg%3Fh%3Dbce50f5e&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fdrewscott_1280.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2Fgettyimages-849046684.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/gettyimages-822840398.jpg?h=bce50f5e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2022-02/Bindi_Irwin_GettyImages-1146814321_1920.jpg?h=b8626526&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-12%2Fgettyimages-822840398.jpg%3Fh%3Dbce50f5e&w=1024&q=100"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/gettyimages-822840398.jpg?h=bce50f5e", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/property-brothers-drew-and-jonathan-scott-turn-40-see-their-hilarious-throwback-pic-101273", "title": "'Property Brothers' Drew and Jonathan Scott Turn 40 -- See Their Hilarious Throwback Pic!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/gettyimages-822840398.jpg?h=bce50f5e", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The twins have clearly always had a silly side.", "title": "'Property Brothers' Drew and Jonathan Scott Turn 40 -- See Their Hilarious Throwback Pic!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/property-brothers-drew-and-jonathan-scott-turn-40-see-their-hilarious-throwback-pic-101273", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The twins have clearly always had a silly side.", "twitter": {"description": "The twins have clearly always had a silly side.", "title": "'Property Brothers' Drew and Jonathan Scott Turn 40 -- See Their Hilarious Throwback Pic!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/property-brothers-drew-and-jonathan-scott-turn-40-see-their-hilarious-throwback-pic-101273", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/gettyimages-822840398.jpg?h=bce50f5e", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "'Property Brothers' Drew and Jonathan Scott Turn 40 -- See Their Hilarious Throwback Pic! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Jonathan Scott, Drew Scott", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
