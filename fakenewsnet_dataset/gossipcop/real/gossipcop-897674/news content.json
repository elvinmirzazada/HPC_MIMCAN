The 35-year-old, Texas-based contestant from Lorenzo Borghese\u2019s season of the show was known for being the center of attention (and, at the time, for exclusively wearing tiaras), and although she didn\u2019t win Borghese\u2019s final rose, she went on to appear on several Bachelor specials and on seasons two and three of Bachelor Pad. And now, the life coach and mother of one has found her true love \u2014 Rose was married over the weekend in Houston, Texas to fianc\u00e9 Charles Sanders! And both the wedding and the events leading up to it were in true Erica Rose form (that is, fit for a Texan princess). From the star\u2019s two gowns to her multiple showers, here\u2019s everything you need to know about her over-the-top nuptials.\n\nRose wore two wedding gowns: the first, a plunging white lace dress from Ventura\u2019s Bridal Fashions, for the ceremony (above); and then a custom blush lace number with a see-through panel designed by her \u201cfriend and fashionista Alex Martinez,\u201d for the reception.\n\n2. Several members of Bachelor Nation were there to celebrate the big day, including Rose\u2019s former suitor Borghese, Vienna Girardi,Ashlee Frazier Williams and Renee Simlak.\n\n3. Rose\u2019s one-year-old daughter Holland Rose Gentry (from a previous relationship) had a role in the ceremony. \u201cShe loved it too,\u201d Rose captioned her sweet Instagram shot.\n\n4. The bride\u2019s mother wore\u2026 white! Rose clearly wasn\u2019t afraid to let her mom, who wore a black-and-white color-block gown, shine too on the big day.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Look Back at Every Wedding Dress From The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise\n\n5. Sanders wore a hot pink yarmulke, and the couple was married under a flower-adorned chuppah at Congregation Emanu El in Houston.\n\n6. The couple had a Kimye-esque rose wall that spelled out \u201cCherica,\u201d which also served as the wedding hashtag.\n\n7. There was also a step-and-repeat.\n\n8. The bride went back to her roots, wearing a jeweled tiara for the big day.\n\n9. She also wore a tiara at her bachelorette party\u2026 although it was decidedly more, well, bachelorette-y. \u201cShe was just a girl with a dream of wearing her own Pink Peen Tiara One Day,\u201d Rose commented on an Instagram snap with her new accessory.\n\n10. Rose also had a lingerie shower before the wedding, where friends and fans got to shop for underpinnings and indulge in bridal-themed pastries.\n\n11. There was also on-site Botox at the shower, for $10 a pop.\n\n12. The couple had several movie-themed wedding shoots prior to the wedding, inspired by everything from Clueless to American Wedding.\n\nWhat was your favorite part of Rose\u2019s wedding weekend?", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/Vw2FvRD53m2egLR-vWF7f6l1O_8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1124x229:1126x231)/Alexandra-Raisman-Instagram-01-050823-3a878055114946688576190e7d5994f2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/BFPTFN84Adrmpm9H0JIiz5URr6k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1039x252:1041x254)/sia-wedding-050923-2-2000-6bf613c1b98840be91148e5a22d07b87.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/W_EGX9EAJXaSSf4meGrzYTXuCv0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(879x385:881x387)/sofia-richie-elliot-grainge-chanel-cruise-show-051023-tout-a35106810d4746979396d7f4d916d77b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/uiQMD_SgZwA0bcz1UkMYCZhce7Y=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x29:766x31)/caelynn-miller-keyes-bridal-shower-051023-3-6e3ebfe8e6eb48f1baf0cb5d49b37f80.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/S0_otrGO2ASCidKf_K4-5kedOxQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(725x117:727x119)/margaret-qualley-wedding-jack-anatonoff-081923-new-1-891f80e9b9d94c87b9b4b063a9bc3430.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/TiWDadk0TxY8Z3dKWjLUrXOUxQc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x494:921x496)/sofia-richie-elliot-grainge-1-83ecb3403f9f459187792db57094d8e2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/6ZruE3sYFCR_--zNaDHy_B2hkvw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1658x1113:1660x1115)/Royal-wedding-of-Liechtenstein-061223-06-57c43ecf616941e0a8a8aaca6ea0c7ec.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/acfJ1_844_8yfeqGUhHmhpGVebY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x584:981x586)/best-royal-wedding-dresses-1-aef9161af110491fb3ce18942bfd4bc4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-V6gJHIW-IJQLZiO0cgjmNxUBxE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(689x449:691x451)/sofia-richie-elliott-3-0421-d60b46abbf9c4af992c92d741e0e91a9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hfPhawyDpZPCkidxPr3nhRjcJSQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x101:736x103)/naomi-watts-billy-crudup-ring-061223-30e8a2e9fb144a0491db499ea79b24a5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/mBKdqOx7UHePOlfUTRJxf_Bxg7Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/simone-biles-wedding-vg-168-10506202393-186fb90cbfc047249abd0d5e934dc334.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/sznfmjeGDATdShJXtpphVusojzM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/hannah-godwin-bachelorette-party-051623-2-40ecaaceaa1649b29e480bca82159876.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9KY0WkoMl8UXsw8OWhve6Z4GMYk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/crown-prince-hussein-of-jordan-wedding-060123-20-004b92abcfab44e1a58945e3ca135459.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qdE4Qn3iml4eMrVnMn4EXF-Z6_Y=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/simone-biles-bridal-shower-040423-1-63dc74b445084e679d4596cd12a9c24d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zDMDDZy_jsmHU1wqD5_5612dNzk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(846x326:848x328)/Morgan-Simianer-wedding-06-052923-99bfcab8825b4b5f8fbb840c074b2f53.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/0NUIcGz0xqIUWrz4Ic7Rvt15mzc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Andi-Dorfman-wedding-10-a442d22fdfb0418dbdf02689a356c75e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/q0Wlsvs6b2tWgfwK1THON1i0Suc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(912x0:914x2)/erica-rose-1-5ce39993291e4a008a6f43c100d24d46.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/q0Wlsvs6b2tWgfwK1THON1i0Suc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(912x0:914x2)/erica-rose-1-5ce39993291e4a008a6f43c100d24d46.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindy Segal", "People Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/bachelor-star-erica-rose-wedding-dress-photos/", "title": "Bachelor Star Erica Rose Is Married", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The star from Lorenzo Borghese's season of the Bachelor tied the knot to investor Charles Sanders -
