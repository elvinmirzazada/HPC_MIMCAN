My emotions feel like I\u2019m in a washing machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou lost your hearing 10 years ago. You haven\u2019t heard Adele, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, but your voice is so current, so amazing,\u201d Cowell told Harvey. \u201cI want to put your story to one side and judge you as a singer, it was amazing \u2026 It was remarkable.\u201d\n\nFollowing her performance, Harvey further explained to host Tyra Banks: \u201cThere\u2019s really not much you can do if you stay on the ground. Time will pass you by, life will pass you by. I just didn\u2019t want to give up.\u201d\n\nThe season 12 winner of America\u2019s Got Talent will be named on Wednesday (8 p.m. ET) on NBC.", "images":
