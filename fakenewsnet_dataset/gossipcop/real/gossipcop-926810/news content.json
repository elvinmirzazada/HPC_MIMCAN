And although we'll have to wait a few more months to see it, the 31-year-old fashion designer shared the first official sneak peek of what's to come via Instagram on Thursday.\n\n\"Ahhh!! Here it is! Your exclusive sneak peek at my new show #VeryCavallari coming to E! this summer,\" the Laguna Beach alum captioned the teaser video. \"Don't forget to follow @verycavallari and stay tuned for more!\"\n\nE! announced that the project was officially greenlit earlier this month, after it was originally announced in February that Cavallari would be working on a reality series that followed her life in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband, as she launches the flagship store for her jewelry line, Uncommon James.\n\n\"Our audience has followed Kristin from The Hills to E\u2019s Red Carpet and will now get a view into her life as entrepreneur and lifestyle tastemaker,\" Amy Introcaso-Davis, EVP, Development and Production at E!, said in a statement at the time. \"We will see Kristin push herself as a boss of a new and expanding brand while combating the pressure to succeed. She will be challenged with juggling her staff of strong-willed employees, making time for her husband, newly retired football player, Jay Cutler, and remaining an active mom to her three kids.\"\n\nDuring an August interview with ET, Cavallari explained that fans likely won't see her kids on camera. \"I want my kids to grow up as normal as possible, and I just don't think you can grow up normal with a camera in your face,\" she shared. \"I don't even put my kids on social media.\"\n\n\"Maybe they don't want to be recognizable, maybe they don't want any of that,\" she continued. \"[Jay and I] want to allow them that choice.\"\n\nVery Cavallari premieres this summer on E! In the meantime, watch the video below to hear everything we know about the upcoming series (so far!) in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2Fkristincavallari_marohagopian_3715.jpg%3Fh%3Db371084f&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-05/blakekelly_getty953262468.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/eto_kristincav_041218_.00_00_08_02.still001.jpg?h=d1cb525d", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2Fkristin_cavallari_gettyimages-927356942.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-02%2Fkristin_cavallari_gettyimages-911195580_0.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/eto_kristincav_041218_.00_00_08_02.still001.jpg?h=d1cb525d", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kristin-cavallari-returns-to-reality-tv-see-the-first-look-at-very-cavallari-100231", "title": "Kristin Cavallari Returns to Reality TV!
