While Saudi Arabia King Salman appeared happy to greet the visitors, a Trump tweet from 2015 suggested he would be offended.\n\n\u201cMany people are saying it was wonderful that Mrs. Obama refused to wear a scarf in Saudi Arabia, but they were insulted,\u201d Trump tweeted at the time.\n\nTrump was referencing President Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s trip to Riyadh in January 2015 in which the First Lady chose to forgo a headscarf.\n\nIt\u2019s likely the hosts weren\u2019t offended in either case, however. While Western women are expected to cover their arms and legs during visits, headscarves are typically not required. Along with Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have opted to forgo headscarves during official trips in the past.\n\nTrump is in Saudi Arabia to give a speech on radical Islam to several leaders of Muslim countries, marking the President\u2019s first foreign trip since taking office in January.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "images": ["https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/melania-trump-outfit-saudi-arabia.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/trump-trip-saudi-arabia-billboard-king-salman.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/newsletter-round.svg", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/washington-politics-unity.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/melania-trump-outfit-saudi-arabia.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aric Jenkins"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4787178/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-melania-ivanka-headscarves/", "title": "Trump in Saudi Arabia: Melania, Ivanka's Outfits Contradict", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The women who accompanied President Trump on his trip to Saudi Arabia appeared to insult the hosts \u2014 according to one of Trump's old tweets", "og": {"title": "Trump Women's Outfits in Saudi Arabia Contradicts Trump's Old Tweet", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4787178/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-melania-ivanka-headscarves/", "description": "The President criticized Michelle Obama for doing the same thing in 2015.", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/melania-trump-outfit-saudi-arabia.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "published_time": "2017-05-20T14:00:08.000Z"}, "category": "World", "primary_tag": "saudi-arabia", "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4787178/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-melania-ivanka-headscarves/", "description": "The women who accompanied President Trump on his trip to Saudi Arabia appeared to insult the hosts \u2014 according to one of Trump's old tweets", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/melania-trump-outfit-saudi-arabia.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4787178/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-melania-ivanka-headscarves/", "title": "Trump Women's Outfits in Saudi Arabia Contradicts Trump's Old Tweet", "description": "The President criticized Michelle Obama for doing the same thing in 2015.", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/melania-trump-outfit-saudi-arabia.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 991230477954201, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495288808.0, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
