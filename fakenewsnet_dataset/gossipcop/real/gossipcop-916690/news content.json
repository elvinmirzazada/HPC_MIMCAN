(She had a brief first marriage to Gary Oldman.) Her hall features a large golden Buddha from her parents in Woodstock; her father, Robert Thurman, is a Buddhist professor of Indo-Tibetan studies at Columbia who thinks Uma is a reincarnated goddess.\n\nBut beneath that reserve and golden aura, she has learned to be a street fighter.\n\nShe says when she was 16, living in a studio apartment in Manhattan and starting her movie career, she went to a club one winter night and met an actor, nearly 20 years older, who coerced her afterward when they went to his Greenwich Village brownstone for a nightcap.\n\n\u201cI was ultimately compliant,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI tried to say no, I cried, I did everything I could do. He told me the door was locked but I never ran over and tried the knob. When I got home, I remember I stood in front of the mirror and I looked at my hands and I was so mad at them for not being bloody or bruised. Something like that tunes the dial one way or another, right? You become more compliant or less compliant, and I think I became less compliant.\u201d\n\nThurman got to know Weinstein and his first wife, Eve, in the afterglow of \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d \u201cI knew him pretty well before he attacked me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used to spend hours talking to me about material and complimenting my mind and validating me. It possibly made me overlook warning signs. This was my champion. I was never any kind of studio darling. He had a chokehold on the type of films and directors that were right for me.\u201d\n\nThings soon went off-kilter in a meeting in his Paris hotel room. \u201cIt went right over my head,\u201d she says. They were arguing about a script when the bathrobe came out.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/02/autossell/KBCrashStill/KBCrashStill-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=599319d4deafdc7d98393efe00ac9937e7f8e529779056e91001aa1784d5607c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/maureen-dowd/maureen-dowd-thumbLarge.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/04/opinion/sunday/04dowd-jump/04dowd-jump-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=599319d4deafdc7d98393efe00ac9937e7f8e529779056e91001aa1784d5607c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maureen Dowd"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html", "title": "This Is Why Uma Thurman Is Angry - The New York Times", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "The actress is finally ready to talk about Harvey Weinstein.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | This Is Why Uma Thurman Is Angry (Published 2018)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=599319d4deafdc7d98393efe00ac9937e7f8e529779056e91001aa1784d5607c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "Uma Thurman in New York."}, "description": "The actress is finally ready to talk about Harvey Weinstein."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html", "title": "Opinion | This Is Why Uma Thurman Is Angry (Published 2018)", "description": "The actress is finally ready to talk about Harvey Weinstein.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg?year=2018&h=900&w=1600&s=61440ad405c7d8c1b255c4b2abdd942a7eac6f7eb9cac12cbdcdd108b2374c5b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "alt": "Uma Thurman in New York."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/f7ca9bef-99d8-58cd-a394-1ab584c3dd25"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-03T14:49:59.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-03T18:57:15.000Z", "section": "Opinion", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/maureen-dowd", "tag": "Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (Movie)", "opinion": "true", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000005715262, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/f7ca9bef-99d8-58cd-a394-1ab584c3dd25", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/13c43414cde248d5bf4865a8bd923257", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=599319d4deafdc7d98393efe00ac9937e7f8e529779056e91001aa1784d5607c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Maureen Dowd", "news_keywords": "Uma Thurman,Actor,Miramax Films,Weinstein,Quentin Tarantino,Harvey Weinstein,Movies,Rape,Sexual harassment,MeToo Movement,Pulp Fiction,Kill Bill: Vol. 1,Kill Bill: Vol. 2", "pdate": 20180203, "CG": "opinion", "SCG": "sunday", "CN": "maureen-dowd", "PT": "article", "PST": "Op-Ed", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/f7ca9bef-99d8-58cd-a394-1ab584c3dd25", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517608800.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
