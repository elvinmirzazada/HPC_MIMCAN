The actress's father, councillor Seb Leslie, owns a castle in his West Garioch constituency.\"\n\nHarington and Leslie, who first met in 2012 on the set of hit HBO drama, announced their engagement last fall with an official announcement in the newspaper, which was absolutely adorable and old-fashioned.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"MR. K.C. HARINGTON AND MISS R.E. LESLIE. The engagement is announced between Kit, younger son of David and Deborah Harington of Worcestershire, and Rose, middle daughters of Sebastian and Candy Leslie of Aberdeenshire,\" the announcement read.\n\n\n\nAs famous couples go, Harington and Leslie are relatively low-key, but they have spoken publicly about their romance on a few occasions.\n\nNotably, Harington described falling in love with Leslie on set during a 2016 interview with L'Uomo Vogue. \"Because the country is beautiful, because the Northern Lights are magical, and because it was there that I fell in love,\" he said. \"If you\u2019re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love.\"\n\n\n\nHarington also opened up about his less-than-perfect proposal during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show in October 2017.\n\n\"I did have some plans to do it, I was going to string up some lights in some trees and do all the romantic stuff, but we were in the country and we were under this beautiful night sky and had a log fire burning and red wine and I blew my load early,\" he said, laughing. \"Sorry, that\u2019s a really bad expression!\"\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1129881970-656530ea85671.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.845xh;0,0.0189xh&resize=360:*",
