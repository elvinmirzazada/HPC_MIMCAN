At one point, the birthday boy could be seen touching the actress' left arm as they leaned in close to talk. Holmes had a huge grin on her face and was laughing at something he said during their chat.\n\nAn eyewitness tells ET that, inside the soiree, Foxx and Holmes \"seemed besotted\" with each other. \"Jamie kept beckoning for Katie to come up to the stage but she didn\u2019t want to,\u201d the eyewitness said. \u201cThey were so cute!\u201d\n\nSplash News\n\nFoxx performed for the crowd, as did Snoop, Ice Cube and Ludacris. Our eyewitness noted that Holmes \"seemed happy\" and \"very entertained by his performances.\"\n\nSplash News\n\nAnother performer at the event? Foxx's gardener.\n\n\"Jamie heard him singing one day and said, \u2018Wow, you sing?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m in a mariachi band!\u2019 So Jamie had the whole mariachi band performing there!\" the eyewitness explained. \"And the man said, \u2018Thank you, Jamie, for letting me serve you for 15 years,\u2019 and Jamie grabbed the mic and said, \u2018No! We work for each other, we work together!\u2019 and they hugged. A lot of the people in the audience got emotional.\u201d\n\nAs ET previously reported, Holmes, 38, sat with DiCaprio and a few friends at a private table to watch Foxx's performance. The Dawson's Creek alum was also snapped in the crowd, wearing a pearl necklace and sporting her new pixie cut.\n\nET\n\nFoxx also apparently wasn't shy when it came to their rumored relationship. According to the earlier eyewitness, the Oscar-winning actor sang along to a song with \u201cI love you\u201d lyrics and looked directly into Holmes' eyes.\n\n\"Jamie definitely was looking and smiling at [Holmes] the majority of the night,\" another eyewitness tells ET of the rumored couple's interaction at the party, though noted that they didn't show any PDA. \"Even when on stage he would look over and point at her and then smile. She would smile back. They sat together at the table for about 30 minutes together until she left with Leo.\"\n\nFoxx and Holmes have been a rumored couple for years, but the two have remained incredibly private about their relationship -- until pictures of them holding hands on the beach in Malibu, California, surfaced in September, which ET talked to him about later that month.\n\nFor more on the Ray star's birthday party, watch the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-12%2Fkatie_jamie_1280.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-06%2F1280_jamie_foxx_GettyImages-696108818.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/jamie_foxx_katie_holmes_spl1637503_04.jpg?h=1c26d4e2", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-01/mariah_900197220.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fsghg.jpg%3Fh%3De83d57ca&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/jamie_foxx_katie_holmes_spl1637503_04.jpg?h=1c26d4e2", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/katie-holmes-and-jamie-foxx-get-cozy-at-the-actors-50th-birthday-party-see-the-rare-pics-92752", "title": "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Get Cozy at the Actor's 50th Birthday Party -- See the Rare Pics!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/jamie_foxx_katie_holmes_spl1637503_04.jpg?h=1c26d4e2", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "They may keep a low profile, but the long-rumored couple definitely looked cozy at the actor's birthday bash!", "title": "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Get Cozy at the Actor's 50th Birthday Party -- See the Rare Pics!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/katie-holmes-and-jamie-foxx-get-cozy-at-the-actors-50th-birthday-party-see-the-rare-pics-92752", "type": "Article"}, "description": "They may keep a low profile, but the long-rumored couple definitely looked cozy at the actor's birthday bash!", "twitter": {"description": "They may keep a low profile, but the long-rumored couple definitely looked cozy at the actor's birthday bash!", "title": "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Get Cozy at the Actor's 50th Birthday Party -- See the Rare Pics!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/katie-holmes-and-jamie-foxx-get-cozy-at-the-actors-50th-birthday-party-see-the-rare-pics-92752", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/jamie_foxx_katie_holmes_spl1637503_04.jpg?h=1c26d4e2", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Get Cozy at the Actor's 50th Birthday Party -- See the Rare Pics! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
