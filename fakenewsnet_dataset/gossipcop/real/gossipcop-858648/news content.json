It\u2019s been me and Lauren for four years, so when you add a daughter to the mix, it makes life even crazier,\u201d Thomas Rhett told Matt Lauer and Hoda Kotb, the latter of whom recently adopted a baby girl of her own. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world. It\u2019s crazy how little Willa has adapted. It\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nThe singer and his wife recently detailed their journey to adoption exclusively to PEOPLE. Lauren first met Willa, aptly nicknamed \u201cBlessing\u201d in her home country, in 2016 when she visited Uganda \u2014 a country with 147 million orphans. At the time, the couple had been trying to conceive without success and had just begun to discuss adoption.\n\nWhen Thomas Rhett saw a photo of Lauren holding Willa, he was struck by his wife\u2019s obvious bond with the baby, who had been orphaned when she was still a newborn.\n\nKailey Dickerson\n\n\u201cLauren had this amazing glow about her and it just felt like she was already our daughter in a weird way,\u201d Thomas Rhett said. \u201d \u2018I just blurted out, \u2018We should bring her home.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I met Willa, her story was pretty intense,\u201d Lauren said of the toddler, who\u2019d been brought to the children\u2019s home soon after her birth in November 2015.\n\n\u201cAll orphans have heart-wrenching stories, but it felt like this specific baby was ours. I think that the Lord knew what he was doing when he did not let us get pregnant.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Adoption Holds a Special Place in Katherine Heigl\u2019s Heart\n\nIt was far from a simple process, though. Many months of documents and red tape followed and, in between, the couple made a dozen trips to the African nation over the past year.\n\nIn the meantime, they discovered Lauren was finally pregnant (another girl!), which meant that her window for bringing Willa home was closing fast.\n\nNearing her third trimester, Lauren traveled to Uganda in April, hoping to bring Willa home. But the adoption wasn\u2019t finalized before she needed to return to the States for a pregnancy checkup.\n\nEventually, Lauren\u2019s dad \u2014 an airline pilot himself \u2014 and her mom took their daughter\u2019s place in Uganda, and the two made the 7,000-mile journey to Nashville, Tennessee, with their new granddaughter.\n\n\u201cSeeing her there felt like a dream,\u201d Lauren recalled of her first glimpse of Willa when her parents drove up to the private hangar where they met.\n\nThough the couple has had to adjust to full-time parenting pretty quickly, they\u2019re relishing in their new roles.\n\n\u201cIt is very weird to be called \u2018Dad\u2019 by a little human being,\u201d Thomas Rhett said. \u201cBut it is one of the coolest feelings in the world. Nothing beats that.\u201d", "images":
