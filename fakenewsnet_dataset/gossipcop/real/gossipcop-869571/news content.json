Even then many chalked it up to nothing.\n\nHowever, fans jaws quickly dropped when they saw Stassi, Katie, and Lala all smiles and having fun together.\n\nThe VPR stars even bragged about enjoying each others company as they documented their shenanigans in Mexico.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cool with this?@stassischroeder,\u201d Lala captioned a photo of her and Stassi before posing with Katie. \u201cTekilla bubba @musickillskate.\u201d\n\nStassi and Lala even joked that Stassi signed Lala\u2019s infamous non-disclosure agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Katie also made it clear that she and Lala have bonded, telling fans \u201cThis is a first\u2026 but hey, chemistry is chemistry. Also sprang tans are chemistry. Also, hello. Edit: \u201csprang tans\u201d are a real.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like everyone is happy about Lala, Katie, and Stassi making peace.\n\nJeremy Madix, who is rumored to be joining the VPR cast, commented \u201cSMH\u201d on one Lala\u2019s photos making it obvious he\u2019s not happy with the company Lala\u2019s keeping.\n\nFor those of you that have been living under a rock Lala, Katie, and Stassi have spent the last two seasons of Vanderpump Rules feuding. In fact, one of the biggest issues between them was the accusation that Lala was dating a married man.\n\nNow, it seems like it\u2019s almost paradise for the VPR crew. Wonder how Scheana and Ariana are feeling about this truce.\n\nAre you shocked that Stassi, Lala, and Katie have made peace? Do you think Lala, Katie, and Stassi\u2019s new found friendship will last? How do you think Ariana and Scheana feel about Lala reconciling with Stassi and Katie? Are you excited for season 6 of VPR?\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.\n\nLike AllAboutTRH On Facebook.\n\nFollow the AllAboutTRH Podcast on iTunes & Soundcloud \u2013 Remember to Rate, Comment & Subscribe!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-logo-lips-small.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dish-071216-siggy-teresa.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-27-at-11.20.43-AM.png?resize=1024%2C654", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-27-at-11.19.49-AM.png?resize=1024%2C655", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-white.png?w=1320", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ramona-singer-ex-husband-mario-singer-mistress-kasey-dexter-hamptons-home-pp.jpg?resize=300%2C168", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RHOBH-Season-7-cast.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://blog-cdn.feedspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Celebrity-Gossip-100-transparent_216px.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/stassi-schroeder-lala-kent-katie-maloney.jpg?fit=600%2C337", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/all-about-trh-logo.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/RHONJ-Season-8-Cast-All-About-the-Tea.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-140x140.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-27-at-11.19.39-AM.png?resize=1024%2C652", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-112x112.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bb.gif?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-27-at-11.20.30-AM.png?resize=1024%2C657", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Heather-Dubrow-Slams-Vicki-Gunvalson-Lies-PP.jpg?resize=300%2C168", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-27-at-11.21.37-AM.png?resize=434%2C56", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/0000.gif?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_9437.png?resize=576%2C1024", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/stassi-schroeder-lala-kent-katie-maloney.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DFcYB7tWAAERuvq.jpg?resize=300%2C168", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-27-at-11.20.57-AM.png?resize=1024%2C650", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/JillZarinRHONY.jpg?resize=150%2C150"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/stassi-schroeder-lala-kent-katie-maloney.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lara Sophia", "Nicole Elaine"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729142145/http://www.allabouttrh.com/2017/07/27/lala-kent-just-made-peace-enemies-stassi-schroeder-katie-maloney/", "title": "Lala Kent Just Made Peace With Enemies Stassi Schroeder and Katie Maloney - The Real Housewives", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lala Kent Just Made Peace With Enemies Stassi Schroeder and Katie Maloney - The Real Housewives | News.
