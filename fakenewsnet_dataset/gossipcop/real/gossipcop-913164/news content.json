Science has an answer.\n\nBy science, we mean the internet. According to IFC, here's the exact numbers:\n\nGroundhog Days Murray\u2019s Phil Connors endures in \u201cGroundhog Day:\u201d 12,403 days. That\u2019s 33 years and 358 days\"\n\nOver 33 years of the same day. By that, you would know EVERY single person in town, which Phil Connors seems too. They came to this by adding up every day we see Phil endure, plus any day he specifically mentions but we don\u2019t see:\n\n(he claims he\u2019s been \u201cstabbed, shot, poisoned, frozen, hung, electrocuted, and burned,\u201d but we only see the electrocution, so tack on six more days\n\nAlso, did you know Billy Murray was bitten twice by the groundhog on the set? Hollywood Reporter reports he needed a rabies shot.\n\nHowever, Hollywood Reporter has a different answer on the days in the movie:\n\nRamis once said Phil was trapped in Groundhog Day for 10 years, even though the original plan was to have him trapped for 10,000 years. According to the website Wolf Gnards, which ran the numbers, Phil was actually trapped for eight years, eight months and 16 days.\"\n\nI'm going with IFC on this one.", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/40/files/2022/03/attachment-GettyImages-1385604337.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/39/files/2018/09/bigfrog-logo-v3.png", "http://townsquare.media/site/41/files/2022/03/attachment-house-2-2.jpeg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/39/files/2019/05/RS29071_Kids-Movies-Mypurgatoryyears.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2022/04/attachment-Bill-Murray.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/39/files/2021/12/attachment-RS19943_GettyImages-860821468.jpeg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/40/files/2020/09/RS8706_177298471.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/937/files/2022/01/attachment-GettyImages-1314769520.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/39/files/2023/05/attachment-RS16559_641276826-scr.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/40/files/2022/03/attachment-GettyImages-1232075106-1.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/39/files/2018/01/GettyImages-633510266.jpg?w=980&q=75", "https://townsquare.media/site/39/files/2018/01/GettyImages-633510266.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/39/files/2018/01/GettyImages-633510266.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave", "Wheels"], "canonical_link": "https://bigfrog104.com/how-many-days-bill-murray-groundhogs-day/", "title": "How Many Times Does Bill Murray Relive Groundhogs Day?", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "bigfrog104fm", "description": "If you've seen the classic Groundhogs Day with Bill Murray, maybe you wondered how many Groundhog Days occur in the movie?
