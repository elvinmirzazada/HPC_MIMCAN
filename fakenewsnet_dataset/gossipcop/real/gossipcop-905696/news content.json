I was just like, \u2018What? Why?\u2019\u201d she recalls, tearing up. \"I have to make space for the good stuff to happen in my life. I don\u2019t like holding onto the past, especially when it\u2019s stuff that, in my opinion, is just petty.\"\n\nWhile Cabello and many viewers watching found the VMAs performance to be a dig at the new solo artist, Ally Brooke told Good Morning America that the fifth member was actually supposed to represent the media.\n\n\u201cWe get asked all the time if we\u2019re getting a fifth member,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd we wanted to show the world in an artistic way that, \u2018Hey, the four of us are Fifth Harmony. We are stronger and better than we\u2019ve ever been.'\u201d\n\nCabello has clearly moved on from Fifth Harmony and recently performed for the first time her new single, \"Never Be the Same,\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with ET, Cabello was happy to look back at her breakthrough year on her own.
