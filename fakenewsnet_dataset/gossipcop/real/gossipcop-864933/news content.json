I'll just point out that it is the act of a giant pussy,\" she concluded. \"Here is a man who's afraid of germs, stairs, books, unprocessed food, women, birds, Muslims, Russian pee tapes, inner cities and, of course, strong winds. But he can't recognize the courage of people who survived literal war zones to come to a new country, start over with nothing and keep going each day despite the contempt with which we're horrible enough to treat them.\"\n\n\"You want a Muslim ban? We know you do, so say it already,\" she said to Trump. \"Own your pointless cruelty. That is why America voted for you \u2026 except for the majority of America that didn't.\"\n\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RM2HtvLSLs?ecver=2]", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gettyimages-516879504.jpg?w=1500", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/9837_18_0687.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/41_KeithUrbanandNicoleKidmanGettyImages634562922H2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ans_split.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/salma_hayek.jpg?w=1500", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-645650504ph.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ans_split.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/michael_j_fox_hargrave_a_l.jpg?w=1500", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/arnold.jpg?w=1500", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gettyimages-513718764.jpg?w=1500", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/matthews.jpg?w=1500", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/natalie_portman.jpg?w=1500", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/emily_blunt_sag_awards_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/25665_012_0088_r-h_2016.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/jim_carrey.jpg?w=1500"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ans_split.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kara Haar"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/14-hollywood-stars-who-immigrated-us-became-citizens-984824/", "title": "14 Hollywood Stars Who Immigrated to the U.S. and Became Citizens", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Many actors and musicians who came to America from other countries are voicing their concerns over President Trump's latest travel ban.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "author": "Kara Haar", "content_type": "List", "post_id": 984824, "title": "14 Hollywood Stars Who Immigrated to the U.S. and Became Citizens", "published_at": "2017-03-20 07:30:00", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ans_split.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Arnold Schwarzenegger, Charlize Theron, donald trump, Nicki Minaj, politics", "topics": "Politics News", "body": "President Donald Trump recently signed a scaled-back version of his controversial ban on many foreign travelers, barring new visas for people from six Muslim-majority countries and temporarily shutting down America's refugee program.\r\nThe move has not been without controversy, and many states \u2014 including Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York and Washington \u2014 are set to challenge the revised travel order.\r\nMany Hollywood stars have spoken out against the order, including some who came to the United States as immigrants themselves.\r\nBelow is a select list of Hollywood stars who immigrated to the United States and are now American citizens \u2014 along with some of their comments against Trump's travel ban and his anti-immigrant remarks.", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "14 Hollywood Stars Who Immigrated to the U.S. and Became Citizens", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/14-hollywood-stars-who-immigrated-us-became-citizens-984824/", "description": "Many actors and musicians who came to America from other countries are voicing their concerns over President Trump\u2019s latest travel ban.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ans_split.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 577}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-20T07:30:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-03-20T07:31:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "14 Hollywood Stars Who Immigrated to the U.S. and Became Citizens", "description": "Many actors and musicians who came to America from other countries are voicing their concerns over President Trump\u2019s latest travel ban.", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ans_split.jpg?w=1296"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1489995000.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
