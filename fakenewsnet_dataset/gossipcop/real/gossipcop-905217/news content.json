The three women said that Simmons raped them in separate incidents that spanned from 1988 to 2014.\n\nWednesday\u2019s report followed previous accusations made by actress and \u201cRachel Getting Married\u201d screenwriter Jenny Lumet, as well as former model Keri Claussen Khalighi, who Simmons allegedly sexually assaulted when she was 17.\n\nSimmons has denied the allegations, and on Thursday vowed to clear his name.\n\n\u201cToday, I begin to properly defend myself. I will prove without any doubt that I am innocent of all rape charges. Today, I will focus on \u2018The Original Sin\u2019 (Keri Claussen), the claim that created this insane pile on of my #MeToo,\u201d Simmons wrote.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Eve-Hewson-Flora-and-Son.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Russell-Simmons.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DESK_S28E111_112723_MW_0003.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Russell-Simmons.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/beyonce-grammys.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/oppenheimer-copy.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Russell-Simmons.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tim Kenneally", "Steve Pond", "Dessi Gomez", "Mike Roe", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/russell-simmons-allegations-under-review-by-the-nypd/", "title": "Russell Simmons Allegations Under Review by the NYPD", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Russell Simmons Allegations Under Review by the NYPD - TheWrap", "description": "Music mogul has been accused of rape by multiple women", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/russell-simmons-allegations-under-review-by-the-nypd/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Russell-Simmons.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "published_time": "2017-12-15T01:35:52+00:00"}, "author": "Tim Kenneally", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Tim Kenneally", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Russell Simmons Allegations Under Review by the NYPD", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/russell-simmons-allegations-under-review-by-the-nypd/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-12-14T17:35:52-08:00", "parsely-section": "music", "parsely-author": "Tim Kenneally", "parsely-tags": "nypd, rape, russell_simmons, russell-simmons-investigation, sexual-misconduct", "article-tags": "nypd, rape, russell_simmons, russell-simmons-investigation, sexual-misconduct}", "article-section": "music", "article-categories": "music", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513301752.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
