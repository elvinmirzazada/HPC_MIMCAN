When a clearly frail Rene appeared she turned to him and sang First Time I Ever I Saw Your Face\n\nEmotional: As Ren\u00e9 Angelil appeared on screen waving, Celine sang towards him. She told the audience the show was 'emotional' although she never revealed quite how desperate her husband's health was\n\nRaw: Audience members said they could feel the emotion Celine Dion attached to the show, which ended with Queen's The Show Must Go On\n\nMontage: Angelil appeared in a video showing intimate moments from throughout the couple's lives, incluidngi old and up to fate family pictures\n\nDion's family told Daily Mail Online that Rene had encouraged the star to keep singing.\n\nClemont Dion, the oldest of her siblings, spoke to Daily Mail Online shortly before the death.\n\nHe said that despite his condition, Rene had always encouraged Celine, 46, to continue with her Las Vegas residency, which she returned to on December 30.\n\nRene was said to watch all of her performances at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas via a special video link set up to their house.\n\nClemont said performing had been a good outlet for Celine, during such a difficult time.\n\nHe said: 'Rene wants her to continue working her residency.\n\n'He wants her to get outside the home and have her singing to concentrate on. I think it has helped her, too.\n\n'It's been good for her to have something to focus on.'\n\nHis wife said at the same time that Celine had taken charge of his care single-mindedly, and not handed it over to others.\n\n'Celine hasn't been taking any time for herself,' she said.\n\n'She does everything to take care of him. There are medical staff in the house but it's Celine who leads. They take care of all the medical issues, of course.\n\n'They are the experts but Celine is on top of everything. She just wanted the very best for him.'\n\nHome: Celine Dion took charge of her husband's care and ensured that he died at home, in Las Vegas, not in a hospital. Their three children were with him until the end\n\nHeartbreak: On Thursday, Celine Dion's husband and manager Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil died at their Las Vegas home just two days shy of his 74th birthday (pictured in 2011)\n\nThe decision to nurse her husband at home meant that the couple's three children, Rene-Charles 14 and twins five-year-old twins Nelson and Eddy, were with him until the end.\n\nClemont Dion said: 'It has been hard on Rene-Charles but the other two, the twins, are quite young, fortunately, so they don't know so much about what has been going on.'\n\nClemont \u2013 the eldest of Celine's 13 siblings - added his mother, Therese, had been speaking with Celine 'two or three times a week' and relayed messages about Rene's health, but the rest of the family had largely left her alone so as not to burden her.\n\nDenise added: 'All the family has been praying for Rene's recovery. It has been hard on everybody.'\n\nThe extent of Celine's emotional involvement was clear in her shows at Caesar's Palace's Colosseum.\n\nIn August 2014, Celine cancelled all upcoming performances in order to take a year off and care for Ren\u00e9 and their family.\n\nWhen she returned to the stage, she had reconfigured her show to become an intimate tribute to the man she married, whom she once described as 'the only boyfriend I've ever had'.\n\nShe had hoped he would be able to sit in the front row on opening night, but he was too ill.\n\nCeline's song selection also reflected the situation, with numbers including Eric Carmen's All By Myself.\n\nCeline also told fans how grateful she is of their support, saying from the stage: 'It's always good when we come back after being away, but I must tell you it's really good to be back, especially tonight.\n\n'I've missed you very much, your applause, your cheers. But I did not miss your love, because I know it was with me all the time.\n\n'I hope that by now you have got the message that tonight's show is very, very personal to me.'\n\nIn recent weeks, Celine ended her main set with a rendition of Queen's 1991 classic The Show Must Go On \u2013 which was surely a promise to Ren\u00e9, who has been the driving force behind her career and performances since she was a teenager.\n\nTragic: Traffic on the Las Vegas Strip drives by The Colosseum at Caesars Palace and the marquee at Caesars Palace showing a tribute to Rene Angelil under an image of his wife, singer Celine Dion\n\nMourning: A sign in front of The Colosseum at Caesars Palace displays a message announcing show cancellations for singer Celine Dion following the death of her husband Rene Angelil\n\nTeam Celine sadly announced on Facebook: '[He had] a long and courageous fight against cancer. The family wishes to live the mourning in privacy'\n\nCeline, said of her decision to go back to performing last year: 'I didn't want to be here at first, I don't need it... But he wants me to do this, [to] do the shows.\n\n'When you see someone who is fighting so hard, it has a big impact on you.\n\n'You can have your shaking knees at the end, but when someone you love falls and needs help, it's not time to cry. Afterwards, sure. But not yet.'\n\nAt one of the last concerts before Rene's death Mary Hicks from Nashville, Tennessee said she could feel the sadness.\n\n'I've been to see Celine five times, and there's a real difference to the show,' she said.\n\n'I think she's a very emotional and highly charged person, and that comes across in the performances, now more than ever.\n\n'The way we all understand it, Ren\u00e9 wants her to keep continuing on even though he's sick, and he knows she loves to perform and he encourages her to do that.\n\n'The song list reflects that\u2013 All By Myself was, for me, a very poignant moment, I felt sad for her when she sung that.'\n\nAngelil passed away after a long battle with throat cancer on Thursday in the arms of his beloved wife.\n\nConfirming the death, the Clark County Office of the Coroner and Medical Examiner said: 'Mr. Angelil, 73, died of throat cancer at his home in Henderson while under the care of a physician.'\n\nRest in peace: The 47-year-old pop diva and her beau - who battled throat cancer since 1998 - had just celebrated their 21st wedding anniversary on December 17 (pictured in 1994)\n\n26-year age difference: In 1981, he reportedly mortgaged his home to fund Celine's first record La voix du bon Dieu and, by 1993, the French-Canadian couple went public with their romance (pictured in 1985)\n\n'Ren\u00e9 says to me, 'I want to die in your arms'': By August, the Overjoyed hitmaker told USA Today that Ang\u00e9lil was preparing for his death\n\nCeline said: 'I have tremendous respect for my oldest, Ren\u00e9-Charles, because he's showing strength to see his dad this way because he's been his anchor. When he was younger he knew his dad was older but they bonded a lot. I'm sure it's hard for him' (pictured in 2011)\n\nRene's health had improved recently and he was able to leave the family home to watch his eldest son Rene Charles play ice hockey for his team the Nevada Storm in November, but over the Christmas period he is thought to have worsened again.\n\nHis health problems first emerged in 1992 when he suffered a heart attack, aged 50. In 1998 he was diagnosed with throat cancer and has undergone a number of surgeries to treat it, including a 2013 operation, which led to part of his tongue being removed.\n\nIn addition to his three sons with Celine, he also had grown up children Anne-Marie, Patrick and Jean-Pierre from previous marriages.\n\nThe five-time Grammy winner was only 12 years old when twice-divorced Ren\u00e9 declared her a star and became her mentor/manager.\n\nIn 1981, he reportedly mortgaged his home to fund Celine's first record La voix du bon Dieu and, by 1993, the French-Canadian couple went public with their romance.\n\nLast March, a tearful Dion revealed her husband was no longer able to eat and was getting all of his meals through a tube.", "images":
