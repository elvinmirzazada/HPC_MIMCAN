(Get it, or nah?) The team art and mascot for the wolves/sheep are pretty much the least subtle reference to Perry's infamous feud-inflaming \"Regina George in sheep's clothing\" tweet:\n\nYouTube\n\nYouTube\n\nNicki Minaj also performing her part of the song, looking the most fierce in an outfit that could've been in the \"Bad Blood\" video:\n\nYouTube\n\nSwift in \u2019bad blood' for comparison Getty
