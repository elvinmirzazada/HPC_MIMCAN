The fans have lived through so many changes, and this is only a new, different one, not a fearful one.\"[21] Chibnall said that he always wanted a woman for the part and that Whittaker was their first choice.[23]\n\nReaction to Whittaker's casting was mostly positive, although a \"sizeable minority\" was unhappy.[24] Some said that a female Doctor would be a good role model for young girls, while others felt the Doctor was only ever meant to be male, or criticised the casting as an exercise in political correctness.[25][26] Whittaker debuted in the 2017 Christmas special \"Twice Upon a Time\".[27][28]\n\nIn November 2018, the BBC confirmed that the twelfth series, Whittaker's second series, began production.[29][30] Whittaker returned for the thirteenth series,[31] and departed the programme following the series and three associated specials in 2022.[32] She also voiced the Doctor in the 2022 BBC Sounds podcast Doctor Who: Redacted.[33]\n\nIn February 2023, a press release indicated that Whittaker was filming for a six-part Australian drama series One Night for Paramount+.[34] In April, it was announced that she would star alongside Bella Ramsey and Siobhan Finneran in the second series of the BBC prison drama Time and that filming would start in the spring of 2023 in and around Liverpool.[35] The series premiered on BBC One in October 2023.[36] In August, she joined the main cast of the Netflix limited series Toxic Town, based on the Corby toxic waste case.[37]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nWhittaker met Christian Contreras, a Belizean-American actor and writer, in drama school, and they married in Arizona in 2008.[6] She gave birth to their daughter in April 2015,[38] and had their second child in 2022.[39] As of 2018 they resided in London.[2]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nKey \u2020 Denotes productions that have not yet been released\n\nStage [ edit ]\n\nRadio and podcast [ edit ]\n\nVideo games [ edit ]\n\nMusic videos [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Artist Director Ref. 2012 \"All of You\" (feat.
