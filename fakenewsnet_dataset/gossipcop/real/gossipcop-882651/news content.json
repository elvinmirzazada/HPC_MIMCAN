It seems that Erinn Hayes won\u2019t make even the slightest appearance in Kevin Can Wait\u2019s season 2. In the premiere, which aired on Monday, September 25, it was revealed in the first scene that her character, Donna Gable, had died.\n\nRelated: 10 Most Devastating TV Deaths of 2016 Viewers lost their heads in 2016 as characters on popular TV shows such as 'Game of Thrones,' 'The Walking Dead' and 'This Is Us' said goodbye \u2014 here are the year's 10 most memorable demises\n\nThe CBS comedy briefly mentioned her absence when Kevin Gable (Kevin James) received a postcard for her gym saying they missed her.\n\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d he said. No other details were given as to what happened to Donna, but she was also brought up toward the end of the episode during Kendra\u2019s last-minute wedding.\n\nRelated: Costars Reunited!

Kendra (Taylor Spreitler) replied: \u201cI know, I wish Mom was here too.\u201d Leah Remini\u2019s character, Vanessa, helped organize Kendra\u2019s big day.\n\nAs previously reported, it was announced in June that Remini was bumped to a series regular after she guest starred on the series on season 1. On the same day, CBS revealed that Hayes would be leaving the sitcom.\n\n\u201cTrue, I\u2019ve been let go from the show. Very sad, I had a great experience season 1. Thank you for all the support from our wonderful fans,\u201d Hayes tweeted at the time. Last month, executive producer Rob Long said that they killed off Donna \u201cout of respect.\u201d\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
