{"url": "https://people.com/tv/kate-gosselin-star-dating-series/", "text": "Kate Gosselin is ready to get back into the dating scene.\n\nIt\u2019s been a little more than eight years since the mother of eight\u2019s divorce from Jon Gosselin was finalized in December 2009, and now, the Kate Plus 8 star is ready to give love another chance.\n\nPEOPLE can exclusively reveal that Gosselin, 43, will star in new TLC series Kate Plus Date, which will document the reality star on her dating journey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nervous, I\u2019m excited, and I\u2019m forcing myself to do this,\u201d Gosselin, who was married to ex-husband Jon for 10 years, tells PEOPLE about the upcoming docuseries.\n\nIn fall 2019, her two eldest children \u2014 twins Mady and Cara, both 17 \u2014 will go off to college, leaving Gosselin at home with 13-year-old sextuplets Aaden, Joel, Alexis, Hannah and Leah. (Collin is enrolled in a program away from home to help him reach his full potential.)\n\n\u201cAs we\u2019re talking about Mady and Cara going off to college which is becoming more and more of a reality, it\u2019s gonna happen, it almost became like a worry for them, too, like \u2018Mommy, you\u2019re gonna be all alone soon,\u2019 \u201d shares Gosselin. \u201cBut it was very apparent, now that they\u2019re older and talking about dating and how they\u2019re all gonna get married someday \u2026 it became apparent: they want someone for me. They want me to have somebody in my life.\u201d\n\nLarsen & Talbert\n\nIn a moment of reflection, Gosselin says she \u201cstarted picturing myself sitting in a rocking chair, knitting, and words like \u2018old maid\u2019 and \u2018spinster\u2019 started to come to mind, and I realized that no, I don\u2019t want that to be my fate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stopped focusing on myself \u2014 I used to be a runner, and all of these things sort of fell by the wayside, and I sort of forgot about the dating thing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s never really fit into my life.\u201d\n\nThough Gosselin admits her life is \u201cvery complicated,\u201d she won\u2019t allow that to hold her back from the possibility of finding happily ever after.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to date someone, I can\u2019t just go out on a date \u2014 it\u2019s creepy to me to think of just going out somewhere with some stranger, and so I actually feel like doing it like this is the best and safest way for me to go on a date \u2014 a camera crew will be there! I\u2019ll be safe!\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the person will have been vetted by a matchmaker.\u201d\n\nFor Gosselin, having her dating life documented for cameras is safer \u2014 and far less intimidating \u2014 than going online.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be just doing some scary online thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, online dating, seriously \u2014 I put my profile in there and people will know who it is within 90 seconds. No, this is probably the safest way for me to date, let\u2019s be honest.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Story Behind the Story: A Lesson Kate Gosselin Had to Learn the Hard Way\n\nAs for what Gosselin is looking for in a match, she\u2019s \u201cnot sure,\u201d but remains \u201copen: whoever they match me with, I\u2019m game.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do want someone with a set career, who is confident. A grown-up with their own life, their own agenda, who knows who they are. If someone travels for work, that would be great, because I\u2019m used to being on my own and being self-sufficient,\u201d she shares.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want anyone she has \u201cto care of,\u201d but rather desires a man who is \u201cself-sufficient, who won\u2019t suffocate me.\u201d\n\nThe TLC personality asserts that the lucky guy she could one day introduce to her kids \u201cwon\u2019t be my kids\u2019 dad,\u201d but rather \u201cwould love my kids to have a mutual friendship and respect with this guy and for him to be someone they can ask for advice. It would be great for my kids to have someone they can feel like is a real friend.\u201d\n\nMost importantly, Gosselin says her perfect match \u201cmust love dogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is such a deal-breaker,\u201d says Gosselin, who frequently shares photos of her furry family members on social media. \u201cPeople disappoint you, but your dogs never will.\u201d\n\nKate Plus Date is coming to TLC this fall.", "images":
