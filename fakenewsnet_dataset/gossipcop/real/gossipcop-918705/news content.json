But it\u2019s just the result of his actions,\u201d Kufrin, 27, tells PEOPLE exclusively in this week\u2019s issue, on stands Friday. \u201cAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t think he thought through everything of how ending things with Lauren would be, how being engaged to me would be and what breaking up with me and going back to her would be. I don\u2019t think he thought it through, but I don\u2019t think he did it maliciously to break my heart.\u201d\n\nAs promised by ABC, Bachelor Nation saw one of the the reality series\u2019 most dramatic finales on Monday evening\u2019s episode. After first ending his relationship with Lauren Burnham during the final rose ceremony in Peru, Luyendyk Jr. got down on one knee and proposed to Minneapolis-based publicist Kufrin.\n\nABC\n\n\u201cThat morning, I woke up and I was very oddly calm. I just felt it in my heart. I just knew it was me \u2014 that him and I were going to be together,\u201d Kufrin shares about the morning of her engagement. \u201cThere were still nerves, but I never was too anxious or worked up about it because I just felt it was right with us.\u201d\n\nUpon getting engaged, Kufrin felt overjoyed. \u201cI felt like my heart was going to burst because it was just so filled with love to be with him and share that news with our friends and family. There was so much excitement and joy,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an overabundance.\u201d\n\nPaul Hebert/ABC\n\nBut after filming wrapped and the newly engaged couple returned back to the U.S., Luyendyk Jr. was unsettled with his decision \u2014 admitting on the show that he still had feelings for 26-year-old Burnham.\n\n\u201cI never thought for a million years that once the going started to get tough that he would throw in the towel and jump ship and say, \u2018Oh sorry, I changed my mind.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think we were at that point whatsoever,\u201d says Kufrin.\n\nAfter having a sit-down conversation with Burnham, Luyendyk Jr. decided to call off his engagement with Kufrin during a weekend trip to Los Angeles.\n\nWant to get all of PEOPLE\u2019s best stories when you\u2019re on the go? Download the SmartNews app on your mobile device and follow PEOPLE for more of the best celebrity and entertainment news!\n\n\u201cI thought we were just going to have a nice romantic weekend. The night before he had turned off his phone, which I thought was strange, and it wasn\u2019t until the moment when he walked into the house when he didn\u2019t have his suitcases with him, I was like What\u2019s going on?\u201d she shares.\n\nReflecting on the tear-filled moment Luyendyk Jr. broke up with Kufrin, she says, \u201cIt was embarrassing the way he broke up with me with the full cameras and crew around.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a better and more tactful way to do it,\u201d she says of getting dumped on national television. \u201cA breakup is hard enough, and to have it all filmed and have to re-watch it and know that people all across the country are watching you get your heart broken, it is embarrassing. It\u2019s not fun. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy. It was like a slap in the face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish he would have been more honest with me. From the questions I was asking, I would have appreciated the full truth. I was obviously blindsided like, Did I miss something? I was asking you these things and you didn\u2019t tell me. What did I miss? How could I have not seen any of this to the extent of how it played out?\u201d she shares.\n\n\u201cAt one point I asked him if he wanted to make it work with Lauren and his response was, \u2018Yeah I want to try.\u2019 So in that instance I knew. I knew at that point, okay I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to try to make up for lost time and he\u2019ll probably go there soon to make it work and to reconcile with her,\u201d she says.\n\nWATCH: \u2018Bachelor\u2019 Arie \u2018Pillow Lips\u2019 Luyendyk Jr. Reveals His Go-To Kissing Tips\n\nWhile Kufrin credits Luyendyk Jr. for being \u201copen and honest in the fact that he had told Lauren he loved her too,\u201d she says that \u201cred flags were being raised\u201d when season 22 of the series premiered Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I knew that he had liked some of her Instagram photos so we had a conversation about it. And that was the first time that he really threw it out that he should have a conversation with her and just apologize for how things had ended with her, that he had felt guilty,\u201d she says.\n\nSays Kufrin: \u201cHe had told me, \u2018I still have feelings for her, I\u2019m trying to work through them.\u2019 He said it was hard for him to always talk about it in interviews with the press, to relive that relationship. He said he couldn\u2019t close that chapter until everything was said and done and the finale aired. That whole time we were just looking at the end goal of this week to finally be done with that and move on and be together and work through it as a team.\u201d\n\nRealizing that Luyendyk Jr. was still liking Burnham\u2019s photos on social media, Kufrin admits she \u201cdefinitely went through all of the emotions. I was upset, I was angry at times, I felt betrayed. When I started noticing those little things like the Instagram likes, I was trying to come at it from a relationship standpoint to compromise and talk through it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would question if he was ready to be engaged and if he was ready at that point to get down on one knee and if not, I\u2019d still stand by him and want to work through it. But of course I\u2019m going to go through all the emotions. I\u2019m a girl, I\u2019m a human being. There was still jealousy there. You\u2019re engaged to me, why are you liking another person\u2019s photos or still wanting to contact them?\u201d she shares.\n\nUltimately, Kufrin wishes Luyendyk Jr. had \u201cbeen much more open and honest about the extent of his feelings\u201d \u2014 and not proposed to her.\n\n\u201cI wish he hadn\u2019t proposed. At that point I loved him and I wanted to be with him. Even if on that last day, he said, \u2018I\u2019m still uncertain, this is a big move, I don\u2019t want to get down on one knee unless I\u2019m 1000 percent sure, but I still want to be with you,\u2019 I would have been fine with that. I would have been like, \u2018I love you, I still want to be with you.\u2019 I even asked him a couple times if he felt like he was certain like that was the right move at that point and every time he said, \u2018I\u2019m happy with the decision and I feel confident in us,\u2019 \u201d Kufrin says. \u201cFrom what he was telling me and from even that grand gesture, I thought nobody would do that unless they did feel 100 percent confident.\u201d\n\nKufrin says she \u201ccan\u2019t fault\u201d Luyendyk Jr. \u201cfor falling in love with Lauren and following his heart because I would never want anyone to stay in a relationship where they felt trapped and it wasn\u2019t right,\u201d but she wishes he\u2019d done things differently.\n\n\u201cHe did get down on one knee, he did propose to me, he did say, \u2018I\u2019m committing to you, I choose you every day.\u2019 That\u2019s something that I only wanted to happen once in my life, and it\u2019s been robbed from me ,and I can never have that one time moment again. And the second part is that he lied or hid his true feelings and emotions for weeks and weeks and weeks,\u201d she says. \u201cThe number one thing that I value in a relationship is honesty and loyalty, and I feel like I wasn\u2019t given that.\u201d\n\nWATCH: The Bachelor\u2019s Arie Luyendyk Jr. Says He Fell for Two Women on the Show\n\nAlthough Kufrin is heartbroken over the situation, she has no \u201cill will towards\u201d Burnham.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, we both just fell in love with the same guy and she can\u2019t help that. The only person that I can fault in this is Arie and the way he handled it,\u201d she shares. \u201cI do feel a little bad that it\u2019s going to be really tough for them when all of this is said and done. Social media is a hard world to navigate through, and there\u2019s going to be a lot of negativity and I don\u2019t think she deserves that. If they want to make it work, then they will, and I hope they\u2019re strong enough to get through it all.\u201d\n\nWith her breakup behind her, Kufrin says she\u2019s ready for \u201cthis chapter of Arie to be done and close it and put it on the shelf and put it away\u201d and only wants Luyendyk Jr. to have what makes him happy.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 change the experience because I met so many amazing people and I fell in love and I had this great experience and memories,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m still going to feel a sense of compassion for him because I did love him but at this point, I want him to be happy, I want to be done and not have to worry about them anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be together and do their thing. I wanted to move on and have my person that I can focus on and live my life with,\u201d shares Kufrin. \u201cAt the end of the day, I do forgive him.\u201d\n\nThe live two-hour After the Final Rose special airs Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\n\u2014With NATALIE STONE", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/qzkqUJQnwV0LmlGZTewcAqGTpSk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x132:981x134)/Love-Is-Blind-Season-3-Raven-and-SK-111622-3f64eeb10a7c46b3aa00c1bd51d89eb3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/LyfdK7UE4HmHBS7T4M1lUL2hEl4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/priscilla-ed-sneckenberger-021323-1-66a2b9fb63c14a16b454f4dbcd3d464e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HSZGe0plh7kxLEs8pwSWJDJQWHA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x680:921x682)/clare-crawley-dale-moss-1-dd72a630116f46c1b704dcd1ad1b8e7e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/gIAfUOl-QhfSwcSXyWXF1F8kh0c=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x279:981x281)/sk-love-is-blind-022523-2000-97a29846a99342df8de8e784e716fa97.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/vPi8thME7B-eRTU6amd_lJHYc5Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Screenshot-2023-04-27-at-3.39.13-PM-cc4cd9dfec1147b8bfed87a5715dd3af.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rfxzCmwzUAZ27sJglrw_duVAaig=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Zach-Shallcross-and-Gabi-Elnicki-2023032732-c806094ce6ed4d5d8ac9e899ec929f57.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/e8Epfm8I6iYrkkvy4W1i9Qce9dQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x429:706x431)/Love-Is-Blind-Season-4-MICAH-032323-4a606f759f0f44ee95e9de80cba488d6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/AGTqTDiwQ46TPyhoqWdCZBrOsfc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/bachelor-7-1-2000-21f7386a52e6475691c696f95f2a0ce7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tNDnOCKeWuyubbGhKeOUSE4CagE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(569x339:571x341)/arie-lauren-2-f10d1093be6741ae828ba46782e2cea1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rKsOObWxFgVZuAlQ-HDbCT1lXUQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x658:981x660)/becca-kufrin-thomas-jacobs-5-d19286f7772349bea7250253af66dbad.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/-YfohJgPzhojZYpTbpxobnFxKXg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x339:736x341)/jackie-josh-love-is-blind-040623-dfe098e5aa7140a79deffe2397d7151f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rjOtUzKnF09ueQUHBd-JIfHaEys=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(329x259:331x261)/jen-and-rishi-01-033023-20922f6a7c234898b48a2f6726d0bbf2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/gQhTjE0bjpZ-F8yCYC_rBcGnQoY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/darcey-stacey-tlc-030123-1-b55ed9b4ddf24fa282df8fd13641a9ad.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/IPznnXNy9eUpiVWxiUf86M2Dc8M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/bachelor-split-2000-95d9ed7d96b34096a895ac9f52aea60d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/a2N-AaIlKlv6Jam4VXfeP2qT7ro=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/bachelor-zach-recap-032023-1-176e2f2a109742cdb79710e6749fe278.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ny2vBNNf-sTspQr35bCybDUmadU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/bachelor-becca-arie-breakup-1-1640d783cd7d49bea3abbe4ab1a90170.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0qQQ98lMBNDOfYqZWkoSEArdjfY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1039x644:1041x646)/becca-kufrin-thomas-jacobs-tout-bd9c7781431042d29eb739731b7b5688.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tj0kZXiLNYnxIggztzu5obedZJw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x599:1021x601)/simon-cowell-lauren-silverman-1-35c9aeb3bb96412886c3e19f30c6fe70.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8cJmVZc7Ok6w5_4Wwxc14qmMsU4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_generic-1885945d8bd544778fbbf4be88a63f00.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/IPznnXNy9eUpiVWxiUf86M2Dc8M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/bachelor-split-2000-95d9ed7d96b34096a895ac9f52aea60d.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aili Nahas", "Aili Nahas Is The Former West Coast Deputy News Director At People.
