A cause of death was not immediately determined and police are investigating.\n\nThe singer - real name Prince Rogers Nelson - was confirmed dead at Paisley Park in Minnesota, days after being rushed to hospital after falling ill on tour. His body was found unresponsive at the estate where he lived and worked in a recording studio.\n\nTMZ, the American celebrity gossip site, claimed that the star had been treated for a drug overdose days before his death.\n\nThey said his plane made an emergency landing in Illinois on Friday so that the singer could be taken to hospital for a \"save shot\" - typically administered to counteract the effects of an opiate.\n\nDoctors wanted him to remain in hospital, but when they were unable to provide a private room Prince and his entourage left. His publicists have not responded to the claims.", "images":
