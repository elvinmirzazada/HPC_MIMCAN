Right or wrong? No, it\u2019s not right for a n---- to cheat\u2026but what you want me to do? Go fuck me another n----? Start all over again and get cheated on again? This shit happens to everyone. People handle they relationship different soo.\u201d\n\nJanuary 14, 2018: The Shade Room once again comes through and posts footage of Offset\u2019s new Cardi B neck tattoo. Because nothing makes up for a cheating scandal like a public and extremely permanent declaration of love, right?\n\nFebruary 27, 2018: Cardi B talks about Offset\u2019s cheating scandal in an interview with Cosmopolitan (*waves hi*) and implies that she\u2019s not guilt-free either. \u201cIt\u2019s like everybody is coming down my neck like, \u2018Why are you not leaving him?

I\u2019m gonna let him say the name since he named the baby.\u201d\n\nJune 25, 2018: Surprise! Turns out, Cardi and Offset have been married since September 2017. Wait, what?! TMZ was able to obtain the couple\u2019s marriage license from Fulton County in Georgia. So that highly public proposal was\u2026just for show.\n\nFunnily enough, at the BET Awards the night before the news broke, Offset thanked \u201chis wife\u201d onstage when his rap group Migos was accepting an award, which made people wonder if they were already married.\n\nJuly 10, 2018: The baby\u2019s here!

I mean, look at her!!\n\nInstagram\n\nDecember 9, 2018: Back to our regularly scheduled programming. Offset tweets this:\n\nAnd a day later, Cardi denied that their relationship was fake and just for publicity. She told her followers, \u201cAin\u2019t no type of publicity that I would ever want that would have my daughter looking at me crazy when she gets older\u2026but we never did anything for f*cking publicity, bitch. You think I got f*cking pregnant, could have ruined my career for f*cking publicity?\u201d\n\nDecember 15, 2018: Offset apologized to Cardi on Instagram, saying, \u201cI know I embarrassed you. I was partaking in activity I shouldn\u2019t have been taking in.\u201d\n\nDecember 16, 2018: Uhh, so Offset just interrupted Cardi\u2019s festival set and begged her to take him back. At the time, Cardi said, \u201cI get that he\u2019s trying. It\u2019s hard. It\u2019s gonna take a long time to\u2014I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next\u2026I just feel bad. This is why I don\u2019t like surprises.\u201d But soon after, it became apparent that her team (and maybe even she) knew he was planning to come onstage.\n\nDecember 22, 2018: They\u2019re vacationing together, y\u2019all. But according to Cardi, it\u2019s nothing more than that. \u201cI just had to get f*cked,\u201d she said.\n\nJanuary 6, 2019: Offset and Cardi have reportedly been in constant communication and he even promised to \u201cchange his ways.\u201d\n\nJanuary 31, 2019: A week after Cardi B said she missed being home with her family, TMZ reported Cardi B and Offset are getting back together and Cardi is apparently moving back to their Atlanta home.\n\nInstagram\n\nFebruary 10, 2019: Cardi and Offset make their reconciliation red-carpet official at the Grammys.\n\nAmy Sussman // Getty Images\n\nMay 1, 2019: Even the Billboard Music Awards got a heavy dose of their red-carpet PDA.\n\nKevin Mazur // Getty Images\n\nSeptember 20, 2019: \ud83c\udfb5Do you know what today is?\ud83c\udfb5 It\u2019s their anniversary.\n\nDecember 9, 2019: Cardi opened up to Vogue about forgiving Offset. She told the magazine:\n\n\u201cWhen me and my husband got into our issues\u2014you know, he cheated and everything\u2014and I decided to stay with him and work together with him, a lot of people were so mad at me; a lot of women felt disappointed in me. But it\u2019s real-life shit. If you love somebody and you stop being with them and you\u2019re depressed and social media is telling you not to talk to that person because he cheated, you\u2019re not really happy on the inside until you have the conversation. Then if you get back with them, it\u2019s like, how could you? You let all of us down. People that be in marriages for years, when they say till death do us part, they not talking about little arguments like if you leave the fridge open. That\u2019s including everything.\u201d\n\nDecember 24, 2019: They bought a mansion, and the tour will make you wish they adopted you yesterday.\n\nMay 11, 2020: Cardi celebrates Mother\u2019s Day, and Offset wrote a super-sweet tribute for her. He gifted her two Birkins and a ton of roses and posted, \u201cHappy Mother\u2019s Day since I met you it\u2019s been love thank you for my beautiful daughter she smart with attitude like you and talented like us both my kids and you help me become a better guy all around Thank You WIFE !!!!\u201d\n\nJune 21, 2020: Cardi posts a photo of Offset with his kids and another of Kulture playing with his hair.\n\nIf these Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day pics don\u2019t make you feel all warm and fuzzy, you might wanna do some soul-searching!!\n\nSeptember 15, 2020: Cardi has filed to divorce Offset after nearly three years of marriage after reportedly finding out he was unfaithful to her again, according to People. Cardi and Offset are set to appear in court on November 4. Neither Cardi nor Offset has made a statement about the issue. In the meantime, an Us Weekly source says that \u201cOffset and Cardi both continue to put [their daughter] Kulture first through this troubling time.\u201d\n\nAaand that brings us up to date on Cardi and Offset. I know it\u2019s quite a somber note to end on, but if any other major events happen in their relationship, we\u2019ll be sure to update you.\n\nRelated Story Upsetting News: Cardi B and Offset Have
