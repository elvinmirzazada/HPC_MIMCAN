And I didn\u2019t know about it \u2014 I found out about it the next day in the press. That for me was like, the final straw. I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen asked how she failed to see any \u201cred flags\u201d during their marriage, de Lesseps admitted to being deprived of perception. \u201cI had that moment of \u2018Oh my god,\u2019 I had these blinders and all of a sudden they came off,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI thought, \u2018This is not good.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAfter seven months of marriage, de Lesseps tweeted Aug. 3 that she and D\u2019Agostino were splitting.\n\nThough their divorce is still ongoing, the pair continues to communicate as \u201cgrown-ups\u201d and do not harbor any ill feelings for one another. \u201cListen you can\u2019t blame [Tom] 100 percent, it was a bad situation that couldn\u2019t get better \u2026 life takes care of itself,\u201d she said.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Luann D\u2019Agostino Announces She\u2019s Divorcing Husband Tom After 7 Months\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he can leave his bachelor life,\u201d de Lesseps shared. \u201cI think he really loved me, he still loves me. He was not going to change his lifestyle, it was a problem for me. He\u2019s a flirty guy, he\u2019s a social guy. People take it the wrong way sometimes, it\u2019s not a good look.\u201d\n\nThe Bravolebrity opens up to PEOPLE exclusively about the divorce in this week\u2019s issue, on stands Friday.\n\n\u201cThis has been one of the toughest times of my life \u2014 that, and getting divorced the first time,\u201d says de Lesseps who was previously married to Count Alexandre de Lesseps for 16 years. \u201cI have a sense of failure, and I hate to fail. I wake up at night, and my bed feels empty now that he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nFor more of Luann\u2019s emotional interview, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday\n\nThe same day her WWHL interview aired, D\u2019Agostino addressed their split for the first time.\n\n\u201cI fell in love, got married quickly and am very sad that two people in love are not together,\u201d Tom, 50, told E! News on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe publicized reasons for the divorce make for a great reality TV story line,\u201d he continued, adding, \u201cI wish Luann much happiness and love.\u201d", "images":
