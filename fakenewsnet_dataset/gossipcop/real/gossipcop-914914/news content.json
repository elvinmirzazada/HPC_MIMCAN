This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\n\n\u201cNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,\u201d their statement continued. \u201cWhatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else\u2019s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another. \u201d\n\nA source told PEOPLE shortly before the breakup that Aniston and Theroux\u2019s differing personalities and interests had put a strain on their marriage.\n\nThey are \u201cvery different people,\u201d the source said.\n\nOn top of work demands keeping them apart, Aniston spent most of her time in Los Angeles with her close-knit group of friends in the months leading to their separation, while Theroux often visited New York City.\n\n\u201cJennifer loves her life in Los Angeles, and if anything, she has grown more attached to being there,\u201d said an entertainment source. \u201cJustin is not that comfortable or happy in Los Angeles all the time. He loves New York and always has.\u201d\n\nAniston and Theroux first met on the Hawaii set of 2008\u2019s Tropic Thunder and began dating in 2011. They later married in a surprise and secret ceremony on August 5, 2015 \u2014 just a few days before Theroux\u2019s 44th birthday.\n\nWhile the duo announced that they separated at the end of the last year, they celebrated the New Year together with their annual vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, alongside a handful of close pals including Jason Bateman and his family.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/F0MwpLk0_vr5jOezyh1r-3LQrHo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x494:981x496)/jason-sudeikis-dating-history-split-258f9a45e00d4dea853d0fb3fe763d11.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-z3YCEXs1IHnV1qyL0Di8JZvHm8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/brad-pitt-80th-annual-golden-globe-awards-011123-3-327250751c804a1eb264b6973d3a476c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/u7RkXKcUfx7WElBpl1U8zeCjQZU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x599:921x601)/jennifer-garner-ben-affleck-c232a2398ae842d7a50801432c33c236.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ONOmSdRKBKirYvCr6JHV9ZGDMM0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(524x379:526x381)/justin-long-kate-bosworth-112822-43f0be5d41544b59aeb17acdcd461d5c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lizPmEHLP4Idux7x2hwWUD4oi0I=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x449:981x451)/jennifer-aniston-bradd-pitt-justin-theroux-a32f0c47037f4c5aa7029f679a36e529.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/R22xybSCqPddmhUZhsBr6LwFMQQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x464:1001x466)/khloe-kardashian-1-f4d684cb2fc743f9a4b2cd57baa261c0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lVL9uC_mB1Bxz4UxJZcZhODTFYc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x659:961x661)/megan-fox-brian-austin-green-1-89ab274abafc476ba5d5eff588ec196f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/bt1Le_T34fbBvwGjcA1GNkKxqCA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x329:676x331)/jason-momoa-lisa-bonet-122022-af0919fd840343aa81554691bdce0b7a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/12xZevr6-KDTlzLBBXwkX1UfdAQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/gwyneth-paltrow-chris-martin-cbdd6d1f7b614247aa25e4d67abc0190.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/iNScP3RGi7M0IAXY7HimbvUNFRQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1079x674:1081x676)/brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-tout-01b9496b7a34406baa35b47c74bcad0b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KlA4-B7GmZgUgJQdz4s-6OnR_JY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x644:1001x646)/brittany-snow-tyler-stanaland-1-6050e1d18ef344f98ab21e11a6ebe9ce.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/u3gx56fvRxoQWzKM_rAUkboO_94=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x554:1001x556)/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-tout-1092eb9a2bd549b5b4f940c6134f3a33.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/XbQpMSvHwnyJL4-uGRhA1iUsVYw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/leonardo-dicaprio-gigi-hadid-091222-2bbc4a7dd77c4c4c841c4fdc4a993b28.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/O2ZI5odUnko95ntDP__wb4R42zU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/sofia-vergara-joe-Manganiello07172344-2715a3505a8b4cedaf753b8a455f5531.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/sLTuEJR-lt1er-nedfXtrMo4tSQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x189:736x191)/Tom-Schwartz-and-Raquel-Leviss-hookup_01-082622-336dd67cdd2045559938956e23bc9878.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3IsuHhfBr2ljghH0zIIgX220gQ4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(640x0:642x2)/jennifer-aniston-and-justin-theroux-c38626ca69dc4fc5ba2a6489b09dbd25.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/cJXaGOoZWmgHxiYvXPKzUD3yfio=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x524:961x526)/brad-pitt-e1794387d9c041d49ea26b0b3019e204.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/3IsuHhfBr2ljghH0zIIgX220gQ4=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(640x0:642x2)/jennifer-aniston-and-justin-theroux-c38626ca69dc4fc5ba2a6489b09dbd25.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Miller", "Mike Miller Is A Former Writer", "Reporter At People.
