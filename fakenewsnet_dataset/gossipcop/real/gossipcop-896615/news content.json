Us Weekly has gathered just a few of the scandalous troubles that happened off-camera that ultimately changed things on camera. When Katherine Heigl exited Grey\u2019s Anatomy in 2010, she said [\u2026]\n\n\u201cWhen I look back at the way I have operated \u2013 also by the way as a serial monogamist for a long time, and stuck in relationships that were not good for me \u2013 I now look back and go, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s not my fault, it\u2019s not their fault.\u2019 Even the guys who f\u2013ked up so bad\u2014and I\u2019ve had a handful,\u201d Bush, 36, revealed to Faris in the interview published on Tuesday, December 4. \u201cWhat I realize is that I have to own my role in it, because more often than not, I have chosen to date the potential I see in someone and not who somebody is in this current moment. And that\u2019s not to throw shade at anybody. That\u2019s simply to say, I settled for less, and maybe that\u2019s because I came into the world like a little Ruth Bader Ginsburg and was like an old woman from time that I was born, and the guys just haven\u2019t caught up? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe Chicago P.D. alum, who was briefly married to her former One Tree Hill costar Chad Michael Murray and has been in multiple public relationships since, has been single for years now.\n\n\u201cWhen I got off a rollercoaster in my last relationship with a person who I love but who like, the relationship was so bad for me, I finally went, \u2018Enough! Just enough! I\u2019m good, I\u2019m done,'\u201d the actress said. \u201cI have companionship because I have the most tremendous community. My friends are so special and amazing, they are like ride-or-die, travel the world, show up at 2 a.m., like, good humans.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Exes Who Have Worked Together After a Split Breaking up is hard to do \u2026 but it is even worse when exes still have to work together after the fact!
