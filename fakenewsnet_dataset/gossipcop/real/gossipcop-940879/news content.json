Who gets this bag from Alexander Wang?\u201d\n\nAfter thanking the acclaimed luxury designer, who recently dressed Kardashian West\u2019s younger sister Kylie Jenner and her boyfriend Travis Scott at the Met Gala, the mother of three added, \u201cI might steal this.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

I missed this last night. Love it,\u201d Kardashian West said while showing off a second, and much more sparkly, purse.\n\nEnthusiastically, she added, \u201cI\u2019m stealing this !!!!!\u201d alongside the image.\n\nThe glamorous birthday gifts also came with a sweet note from the designer himself, which read, \u201cHappy birthday! Every girl needs a little sparkle.\u201d\n\nKim Kardashian/Instagram\n\nWhile Kardashian West has yet to reveal what this year\u2019s plans for North\u2019s birthday are, last year her family celebrated North\u2019s big day by having a party at Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s. Later on in the month, the KarJenners threw a joint Moana-themed bash for North and her cousin Penelope Disick.\n\nThe reality star and husband Kanye West are also parents to son Saint, 2, and 4-month-old daughter Chicago.\n\nDays after enjoying some quality family time with her family in Wyoming, North had a pretty embarrassing encounter with her grandmother Kris Jenner back home.\n\n\u201cYesterday I took North to school and they had crazy hair day, so I wore a blonde wig \u2014 thinking I\u2019d be the cool grandma, you know, at school,\u201d Kris, 62, shared with Entertainment Tonight on Thursday.\n\nBut while Jenner may have been feeling her look, North was not impressed.\n\nKim Kardashian/Instagram\n\n\u201cNorth was rolling her eyes, probably mortified that her grandmother wore a blonde wig,\u201d Jenner told the outlet, laughing off the moment. \u201cIt was so funny! I mean, a crazy blonde wig.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/5WOL_WSeq0Q9rRABCgE4dRj960A=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x9:751x11)/mason-disick-bar-mitz-121922-2-6df29e4d4a054190875577dcc72fd627.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/PhHmIVSy4H8GYKmMkT568pC6DnI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x398:921x400)/Kim-Kardashian-north-hulu-112422-01-2000-6763da31c3f7419f87fa2c7f8a97ec2c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/A3tH6Ytnzppv7RnmZwIdWHDJWdA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kim-kardashian-chicago-20191125_75-b93a1f917fbb4553b57710a8dccb9826.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lUwaURmzmK22doPnpDzhkRZBNK4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kim-kardashian-mason-birthday-post-121522-1-ac357ad976554650b54c4e3c1169b488.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HqUlGCQlW_s-LHPsZRruBTyc8To=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kardashians-holiday-style-20191125_96-2000e5b945954a8f8b38278d554a4659.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/btfzrJdTYuCj1ZE4-YV_xSDpkNc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(664x0:666x2)/kim-k-265dcdcf489c42ad989887c71350f233.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/khmGFhfNfEXl4iqPHjIA4uZKq9Y=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kim-kardashian-north-west-111622-1-73ee7bae69af45269404067efbaf5cc0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/t5-0VcgZgKcEKm0aLTBcbUfHhp0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x109:751x111)/karjenner-outfits-mason-bday-121922-f6e66b98d06d40c4b8221958a0ae848e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9ULZ8hEQwGm85VLXHP0pIMZdjQA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(465x764:467x766)/khloe-kardashian-a47f1b949c114e39980244d22d180396.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/fRuW7wTjXTTdKkiyOtaXbiB6ueo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1049x289:1051x291)/north-west-drawings-021423-3-598f231196e1462b8d6f5e40dcc22885.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/UejUTZJoGHLIKQl7GyndrRBWyi0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(690x114:692x116)/kris-kylie-jenner-pjs-122722-7aa5387a2d34493991255c022a85e088.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8E0kT4Pwzo2YJaGLVaQKVOP3Ne4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kim-kardashian-100322-1-709b82151ac14a89b0f9782cc1deb7e0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4a7v_jKMktMIuOUaxK5_Z-qXE1o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x139:736x141)/North-West-michael-jackson-split-121122-3a64c272ec8243a19c4a6a6c13bac591.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-a7zjBkOsyz7dQxIMDPHwv1Q7HY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x199:736x201)/north-west-kris-jenner-110522-fd0c8bd2bd7a41618ba88c7391d67eb6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/wqQyYgacr3b84uTrzE0bBrKfqWY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x670:941x672)/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-kids-1-304f53bd13b740a4a474fe7adc98be8f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/pXlCxPPuDPHOK4nFcyxMFS9XMYs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x209:736x211)/Kim-Kardashian-chicago-011523-18ec3f70a4f94747bdbc9efae138c540.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KP4DhD5JfF9FSSVzMtUW0TEEFQ8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/kim3-2000-c71d59c69c8246d0954151ad597fe73b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lZoJ80HMEY5qFn9kIJvVas5ReRY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(667x0:669x2)/kim-b-1-6e523642f8e0427798794ce399270dce.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ak8KhYQcO6MiehZlsha5q7NlF6g=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(507x406:509x408)/kris-jenner-4eebfacb83e544e08f82a3c84b211c4d.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/btfzrJdTYuCj1ZE4-YV_xSDpkNc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(664x0:666x2)/kim-k-265dcdcf489c42ad989887c71350f233.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Staff Editor For Human Interest S Digital Vertical At People.
