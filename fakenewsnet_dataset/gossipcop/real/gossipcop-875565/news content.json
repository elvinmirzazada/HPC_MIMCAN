But Wednesday\u2019s trip to Mexico might just take the cake!\n\nBethenny Frankel, Ramona Singer, Luann D\u2019Agostino, Sonja Morgan, Carole Radziwill, Dorinda Medley and Tinsley Mortimer left the Big Apple behind for a trip to Puerto Vallarta. While the President\u2019s Day weekend getaway was supposed to bring fun in the sun and a relief from the stresses of life at home, the drama that followed proved to be anything but relaxing.\n\nHere were four of the biggest and most ridiculous moments from an episode that might just go down in history as one of the show\u2019s best.\n\n1. Choosing a room nearly caused World War III.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe any of the New York Housewivescould find something to complain about with the rooms at the luxurious La Vida Dulce Villa in Banderas Bay. And yet, Singer and Morgan found a way.\n\nThe two BFFs, who have a long history of nitpicking over the room they share on vacations, started the conflict right away \u2014 sneaking away from the ladies during a group tour of the complex to stake their claim on the best room.\n\nFrankel wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cThey\u2019re not going and getting their rooms \u2014 it\u2019s not happening. We\u2019re grown women and we\u2019re going to do it fair. We\u2019re not f\u2014\u2014 Gabon animals,\u201d she said, telling Singer and Morgan, \u201cNobody acts like this!\u201d\n\nThough Singer and Morgan tried to claim they had gotten the worst room the last time, their protests were shot down and the group drew numbers out of a bowl determining the order in which they could select their rooms. They ended up drawing the two final slots.\n\nHeidi Gutman/Bravo\n\nThat should have been the end of it, but Singer and Morgan wouldn\u2019t go out without a fight.\n\nFirst, they set their sights out on Mortimer, who had given up her top spot so that Frankel could have the best room. \u201cYou should have given me that room,\u201d Morgan told Mortimer, at the encouragement of Singer. \u201cYou\u2019ve been staying at my house for free. You didn\u2019t think of me for one second.\u201d\n\nWhen that didn\u2019t work, they tried to convince Medley and Radziwill to share the Jack and Jill Suite \u2014 which had four single beds and one joining bathroom (\u201cI want light, I want sun,\u201d Singer shouted. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to f\u2014\u2014 live in the attic\u201d).\n\nBut that idea didn\u2019t sit well with Medley, who had given up her room for the duo during their Vermont trip earlier in the season. \u201cStop being a spoiled brat,\u201d she shouted at Singer. \u201cWe\u2019re staying here, and you\u2019re not staying here. I will literally take your s\u2014 and throw it in the pool.\u201d\n\n2. Frankel had zero patience with Singer\n\nNoam Galai/WireImage; Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty\n\nFrankel and Singer made a pact to drop the \u201cnasty\u201d attacks and move on after being at each other\u2019s throats all season long. And while Singer appeared to keep up her end of the bargain in Mexico, Frankel sure did not.\n\nSick with the flu and at her wit\u2019s end over Singer\u2019s aforementioned room shenanigans, Frankel threw a lot of insults Singer\u2019s way.\n\nSome of the many names she called her included a \u201cgrabber;\u201d a \u201cmiserable, disgusting, grabby twat;\u201d a \u201cvile human being;\u201d an \u201casshole,\u201d a \u201cnasty person;\u201d a \u201croom whore;\u201d a \u201cbully;\u201d \u201cself-serving;\u201d \u201cdisgusting;\u201d \u201cnot a happy person;\u201d and a \u201cmean old lady.\u201d\n\nSinger shrugged off most of the comments \u2014 only telling Frankel that she wasn\u2019t \u201cbeing nasty\u201d when pointing out that the trip was a group trip and not Frankel\u2019s trip. \u201cShe\u2019s not in a good mood,\u201d Singer told D\u2019Agostino. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll make up. I can\u2019t do anything right by Bethenny. I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\n3. Tinsley had a breakdown after a gossip site wrote about her and Sonja Morgan\n\nPhotograph by Gillian Laub\n\nAs a former socialite, Mortimer is used to her name being in the press. But ever since news broke about her April 2016 arrest for trespassing at ex-boyfriend Alexander \u201cNico\u201d Fanjul\u2019s Palm Beach home, the 41-year-old blonde has backed away from the headlines.\n\nSo it\u2019s understandable that Mortimer was upset when she got a tip that Page Six was running a piece claiming she\u2019s been an ungrateful houseguest in Morgan\u2019s townhouse, where she\u2019s been living for the past three months. \u201cThis is not what I need right now,\u201d Mortimer told Radziwill. \u201cIt\u2019s making me look like a person I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nLater at dinner, Mortimer confronted Morgan and Singer \u2014 questioning each about leaking the story to the press. Both ladies played innocent. \u201cPeople talk! I didn\u2019t talk to the press!\u201d said Morgan. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you weren\u2019t ungrateful. I just said you could be inconsiderate. Why would I tell that to the press? Who cares?\u201d\n\n\u201cI avoid the press. I don\u2019t talk to the press. I hate the press!\u201d Singer added, in her defense. \u201cWho gives a s\u2014? It\u2019s not like you killed someone.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Exclusive: RHONY\u2019s\u2019 Tinsley Mortimer on Moving on After Her Humiliating Arrest and Violent Relationship: \u2018I Still Believe in Love\u2019\n\nMortimer was still upset though. \u201cI care,\u201d she shouted. \u201cRamona, shut the f\u2014 up. I\u2019m a lovely house guest!\u201d\n\nShe then stormed away from the table in tears, screaming: \u201cOh my God! Once again I\u2019m not inconsiderate!\n\n\u201cSonja, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to you right now but you are being so insensitive to me,\u201d she said later. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you. You are a nice person, you are my friend.\u201d\n\nMorgan remained steadfast in her innocence. \u201cI did not do that!\u201d she said. \u201cYou know me better \u2014 you know I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\n4. Luann got drunk and fell down\u2026 twice.\n\nBravo\n\nAmid all the fighting and drama, D\u2019Agostino appeared to be enjoying the bountiful margaritas being poured. So much so that she found herself on the floor\u2026 twice.\n\nThe newly married former Countess is known for being able to hold her alcohol, as Radziwill, Frankel and Singer all pointed out in confessionals during the episode. But the tequila got the best of her Wednesday night \u2014 and into the bushes she went.\n\n\u201cOh my God, Luann, are you okay? You fell in the bushes!\u201d Singer said after her first tumble as D\u2019Agostino was lifted by the Villa\u2019s staff from the shrubbery. \u201cI never saw someone fall like that,\u201d Singer continued to viewers. \u201cLuann out of all of us holds her liquor the best. But tonight, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening to her.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: LuAnn De Lesseps had 3 Beautiful Dresses Made For Her Wedding\n\nThe second fall happened when D\u2019Agostino went to walk down a step, not realizing it was a ledge. \u201cOh s\u2014\u201d she screamed as she rolled around the floor. \u201cThat\u2019s bad!\u201d\n\nThis time, Singer wasn\u2019t as quick to check if her friend was okay. \u201cYou should have gone this way, okay? I\u2019m going this way,\u201d she explained, pointing out the path. \u201cYou went the wrong way. You didn\u2019t see, it\u2019s late at night. There\u2019s no lights and you could have broken your ankle sweetie. Are you okay?\u201d\n\nLuckily D\u2019Agostino was, and retreated home to her room with the help of one of the Villa\u2019s employees. \u201cThis is my tipsy girl,\u201d she joked.\n\nThe Real
