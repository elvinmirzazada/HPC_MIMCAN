Their friendship chemistry is off the charts onscreen because it's so genuine. In between helping the \"heroes\" (or contestants) from each episode, these five guys laugh, joke around, and open up to each other in ways that you do only with friends you've known for years. For more proof of their bond, just head on over to their Instagram pages, where they're always leaving each other sweet comments and compliments.\n\nSo when the Fab Five stopped by Glamour's office a few weeks back, of course we wanted to talk about their tight-knit relationship\u2014and their quotes didn't disappoint. \"[Antoni] is someone who really shows up for me, like, anytime I need him\u2026. He totally just lets me be myself,\" Jonathan said about Antoni during our interview. \"Jonathan inspires me to be more OK with being me,\" Bobby said about Jonathan just a few minutes later. You feel that? That's your tear ducts welling up because all of this is just so tender.\n\nEven more tender, though, is we had the Fab Five do friendship exercises after gushing about each other. First, they stared into each other's eyes for one minute. It was beautiful; I cried. Then they hugged for a minute. It's was beautiful; I cried. And they capped things off some trust falls. It was beautiful; I cried. Are you sensing a pattern here?\n\nCheck out the video, above, to see the Fab Five's friendship in action. Who gave them permission to make me this emotional on a Tuesday?\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nThe First Episode of Queer Eye Season 2 Is More Emotional Than All of Season 1\n\nQueer Eye's Fab Five Reveal Their Stranger-Than-Fiction Origin Story\n\n13 TV Shows That Changed Everything for LGBTQ+ Representation", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b324c8a4451e155fb87f7b3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/queer-eye.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6555351c7d99662d858d2efa/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_image.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_800%2Cq_80%2Cw_800/v1691000583/glamour_gl-friendship-test-tomorrow-x-together.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6554e1d09ae59ab7c538ed10/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_image.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_800%2Cq_80%2Cw_800/v1696869212/glamour_gl-woty-millie-bobby-brown.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b324c8a4451e155fb87f7b3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/queer-eye.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christopher Rosa"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/the-queer-eye-guys-friendship-tests-video", "title": "The Queer Eye Guys Did a Bunch of Friendship Exercises, and It's Honestly So Tender", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "The 'Queer Eye' guys stopped by our offices a few weeks ago, and we had them do trust exercises.
