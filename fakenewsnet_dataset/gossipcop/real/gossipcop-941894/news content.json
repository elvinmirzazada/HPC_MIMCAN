So I bought one on Amazon. I have always loved Danny. I loved him on It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philedelphia, I loved him in Hercules and Matilda. I just love him in every form he takes. Danny was there for me when I really needed him. He treats me the way a woman should be treated.\n\nIn the video, she \u2018interviewed\u2019 her dad, who told her that though he\u2019s a \u201clittle bit older\u2026\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a very nice man and I think he\u2019s going to treat [his daughter] with a lot of respect.\n\nThe initial video went viral and people viewed it thousands of times.\n\nCloss\u2019 photo with cardboard DeVito was shared widely online \u2013 it was even upvoted more than 100,000 times on Reddit.\n\nIn fact, it spread far and wide \u2013 and waltzed right onto Danny DeVito\u2019s radar.\n\nThe veteran actor\u2019s It\u2019s Always Sunny co-star Rob McElhenney spotted her picture and DeVito felt compelled to respond in kind:\n\nI heard you took cardboard Danny to Prom. What a coincidence. He took cardboard Allison to Paddy's [the pub in It's Always Sunny].\n\nSlide for IRL Danny >>>\n\nAnd when Closs found out about DeVito's homage to her, well, the wonderful story came full circle.\n\nThe internet is a great thing, sometimes.\n\nMore: Daughter teaches mum how to recreate her viral optical illusion and it\u2019s hilarious\n\nMore: Man goes viral after trying to sell invisibility cloak on Facebook", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 0 0'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1200 800'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 314 80'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.indy100.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=28116297&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0", "https://www.indy100.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=28116297&width=1245&height=700&quality=85&coordinates=83%2C0%2C83%2C0"], "top_img": "https://www.indy100.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=28116297&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Narjas Zatat"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indy100.com/news/danny-devito-cutout-prom-teenager-response-its-always-sunny-set-8384766", "title": "Teen takes Danny DeVito cutout to prom and he responds perfectly", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@", "image": "https://www.indy100.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=28116297&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"}, "fb": {"app_id": 774315275936299, "pages": 500624210050210}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.indy100.com/news/danny-devito-cutout-prom-teenager-response-its-always-sunny-set-8384766", "site_name": "indy100", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.indy100.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=28116297&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "title": "Teen takes Danny DeVito cutout to prom and he responds perfectly", "description": "A Danny DeVito superfan has got his attention \u2013 after she took a cardboard cutout of him as her prom date.Pennsylvania student Allison Closs couldn\u2019t find a living, breathing date for her dance, so she decided to order one online.In a YouTube post about it, she said:\r\nI couldn\u2019t find myself a date i..."}, "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2018-06-06T14:17:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-06T14:17:16+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/500624210050210", "author_name": "Narjas Zatat", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 307, "image_count": 1, "video_count": 0}, "description": "A Danny DeVito superfan has got his attention \u2013 after she took a cardboard cutout of him as her prom date.Pennsylvania student Allison Closs couldn\u2019t find a living, breathing date for her dance, so she decided to order one online.In a YouTube post about it, she said: I couldn\u2019t find myself a date i...", "referrer": "always", "theme-color": "#647187", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "ZHzYNgB0fzQYVJSHHjZbLhZlbFob7pVOigTvIeTyK0E"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528294636.0, "source": "https://www.indy100.com", "summary": ""}
