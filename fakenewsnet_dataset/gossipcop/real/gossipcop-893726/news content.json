This time the person who gets the honor is none other than Ryan Seacrest's mother, Connie Seacrest.\n\nIn Tuesday, November 14 episode of \"Live with Kelly and Ryan\", Ryan read a comment from a viewer who said, \"You should do a side-by-side shot of Ryan's mom and Taylor Swift, she could be Taylor Swift's mother.\"\n\nThe show then put together a picture of Taylor from the 2015 Billboard Music Awards and a shot of Connie in the studio side-by-side. Rocking short bob hair, Connie does have similarity with the 27-year-old pop superstar.\n\n\"I see it!\" Kelly Ripa said in agreement. The camera then replaced Taylor's face in the picture with Connie's face. Ryan laughed and commented, \"I apologize, Taylor. I'm sorry, Taylor. What an honor mother.\"\n\nTaylor Swift recently released her sixth album \"Reputation\", which has sold more than 1 million in the U.S. after four days in sales. She surprised her fans when she visited Target in Nashville to buy the album.\n\n\"We always have this tradition of going to Target to buy the album,\" Taylor shared on Instagram Stories. \"We're gonna go get some magazines. We're going to Target.\" She took some of her backup singers and dancers during the trip.\n\n\"I just wanted everyone to be updated that we already started stalking Christmas stuff,\" she joked before discovering her CDs. \"It's wrapped in shiny plastic!\"\n\nFor some shoppers and employees, it turned into a night that they'll never forget. Some fans got a chance to take pictures with the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" songstress.\n\nugh that feeling when you go to target to get toothpaste and meet Taylor Swift but forget the toothpaste Sebuah kiriman dibagikan oleh RYSCHOP\ud83c\udf3b (@ryschop) pada Nov 14, 2017 pada 4:44 PST\n\nTaylor will continue to promote the album by hitting the road.
