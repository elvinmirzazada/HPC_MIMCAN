The couple also shares a 5-year-old son, Christopher, and a 3-year-old daughter, Milani.\n\nMonique shared five pics from the special day that show baby Chase posing with his mother, father and siblings. Both Christopher and Milani held their baby brother, while Mom and Dad watched on. The little bundle of joy looked thrilled in the shots as he held his mom's finger and hung out in his parents' arms.\n\n\"It\u2019s... A... BOY!!!! Told yall! I\u2019m 3 for 3 with guessing genders now ???? Chase Omari Samuels born 1 week early (today) at 4:56pm weighing 8lbs 15oz 21 [inches] long!\" Monique captioned the pics. \"Thank God for a safe and fast delivery and one healthy baby boy!!!! Thank you all for the well wishes and prayers ??? Thank you @people for another amazing exclusive and thanks to my sister @callme_tosh who took all these pics ? and didn\u2019t pass out while I pushed the baby out ???.\"\n\nET caught up with Monique back in July, where she discussed her pregnancy. At the time she recalled asking her husband, \"What are we going to do with three kids?!\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, oh my goodness. I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m excited. I really love the baby stage, so I\u2019m really looking forward to it,\" she said at the time. \"It\u2019s nothing more precious than this little, innocent baby that\u2019s just helpless and they just look at you like you\u2019re the world, you know? Once they get older, they get a little more independent. It\u2019s just an amazing feeling, I\u2019m really looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nThe happy pregnancy news comes after Monique shared the heartbreaking news that she suffered a miscarriage last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, now, I\u2019m finally able to really enjoy the pregnancy because, you know, there was so much fear in the beginning \u2026 now that we\u2019re past that, we\u2019re out of the first trimester, I finally just had to sit back and go, you know what? I\u2019m going to enjoy every bit of this pregnancy and I\u2019m not going to live in fear,\u201d she said. \u201c[We want to] let people know that you\u2019re not the only one. You don\u2019t have to feel alone. Everyone goes through these things.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below for more Real Housewives baby news:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-07%2F1280_rhop_monique.jpg%3Fh%3Db92db31b&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-11/samuels.jpg?h=59450369", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-04%2F1280_RHOP_PREVIEW.jpg&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-08%2Fpic_bravo_charles_sykes_monique_on_couch.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-11%2Fsamuels.jpg%3Fh%3D59450369&w=1024&q=100"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-11/samuels.jpg?h=59450369", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/real-housewives-of-potomac-star-monique-samuels-gives-birth-to-baby-no-3-114520", "title": "'Real Housewives of Potomac' Star Monique Samuels Gives Birth to Baby No. 3", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-11/samuels.jpg?h=59450369", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "She gave birth to a healthy baby boy on Monday!", "title": "'Real Housewives of Potomac' Star Monique Samuels Welcomes Third Child", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/real-housewives-of-potomac-star-monique-samuels-gives-birth-to-baby-no-3-114520", "type": "Article"}, "description": "She gave birth to a healthy baby boy on Monday!", "twitter": {"description": "She gave birth to a healthy baby boy on Monday!", "title": "'Real Housewives of Potomac' Star Monique Samuels Welcomes Third Child", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/real-housewives-of-potomac-star-monique-samuels-gives-birth-to-baby-no-3-114520", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-11/samuels.jpg?h=59450369", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "'Real Housewives of Potomac' Star Monique Samuels Gives Birth to Baby No. 3 | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , The Real Housewives of Potomac, Babies & Kids", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
