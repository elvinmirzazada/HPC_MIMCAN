With less than two weeks until the season 4 premiere, ABC has released the first official photo of the cast.\n\nThe group shot was seemingly taken before the much-talked about sex scandal surrounding Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, as both appear in the photograph.\n\nThough neither Jackson nor Olympios returned as cast members when BiP resumed filming after an internal investigation concluded there was no evidence of misconduct between the two, they will be appearing on the reunion special, which will be televised later this summer.\n\nPaul Hebert/ABC\n\nPEOPLE previously revealed the exclusive first look at the official portrait for this season, which features two intertwined hearts drawn in the sand accompanied by rose pedals and the phrase \u201cThe beach is open\u201d typed atop turquoise waters.\n\nSeveral contestants confirmed they are returning to Mexico for the fourth season of the Bachelor/ette spinoff, including Amanda Stanton, Jasmine Goode, Raven Gates, Lacey Mark, Dean Unglert, Vinny Ventiera, Robby Hayes, Taylor Nolan, Kristina Schulman and more.\n\nIn June, BiP production was suspended after producers raised concerns about a sexual encounter between contestant Jackson, 30, and Olympios, 24, both of whom had reportedly been drinking heavily all day. Filming on the fourth season of BiP had stopped due to what the production company called a \u201cmisconduct.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Vinny Ventiera on Returning to Paradise Following Corinne Olympios & DeMario Jackson Scandal \u2014 \u2018We Turn It Into a Positive Thing\u2019\n\nDays after production was shut down by Warner Bros. to investigate the \u201cmisconduct\u201d and the contestants were sent home, Olympios and Jackson both released statements.\n\n\u201cI am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4. Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production,\u201d Olympios said in a statement to PEOPLE via her rep.\n\nLike Olympios, Jackson also retained legal counsel, and said in his statement, \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that my character and family name has been assassinated this past week with false claims and malicious allegations. I will be taking swift and appropriate legal action until my name is cleared and, per the advice of legal counsel, will be seeking all available remedies entitled to me under the laws.\u201d\n\nGetty (2)\n\nWarner Bros. said in a statement that the company \u201cdoes not intend to release the videotape of the incident,\u201d but insisted that they \u201cplan to implement certain changes to the show\u2019s policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants.\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Most Expensive TV Shows of All Time\n\nTwo weeks after production was shut down, and after Warner Bros. announced that its investigation was complete and concluded that there was no evidence of misconduct, Olympios announced that she would not be taking legal action in the wake of the scandal.\n\nSeason 4 of Bachelor in Paradise will kick off its two-night premiere on Monday, Aug. 14 at 8 p.m., and continue on Tuesday, Aug. 15 at 8 p.m., both on ABC.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/gwqDuv96kcAyRlEGCcdoywAuykI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(639x0:641x2)/wells_pub-486f0919d55d434c862ee89b02b0e6db.jpg",
