Check out the previous Outlander recap here.\n\nBoth Brianna and Roger make the leap through time in this week\u2019s Outlander, thank goodness. It\u2019s been fun watching Jamie and Claire channel Bob Vila and all, but I\u2019m ready for the Frasers and Rog all to be in one place (and century) so that the joyful reunions, tearful misunderstandings and 18th-century game of telephone* can get underway!\n\nOn a related note, this week\u2019s episode brings back two characters we haven\u2019t seen in a while: Frank and Laoghaire. For the first time, particularly in Laoghaire\u2019s case, we see aspects of both that don\u2019t come to light when the story is told from Claire\u2019s perspective. Also: Nell Hudson doesn\u2019t get nearly enough credit for how masterfully she plays Jamie\u2019s ex-wife.\n\nBut wait, before I forget: Did Frank know Claire was destined to go back in time again?\n\nRead on for the highlights of \u201cDown the Rabbit Hole.\u201d\n\n*Don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about? You will, and soon!\n\nBRIANNA ARRIVES | Brianna, who definitely made it back to old-timey Scotland, walks through the Highlands in the snow. She occasionally consults an old map, but she\u2019s a long way from anything even slightly resembling civilization. At one point, she falls and severely hurts her ankle; when she soaks it in an icy stream to stem the swelling, we see that it\u2019s badly sprained. But she pushes on, limping along a road and sleeping under the stars. She\u2019s able to start a fire using a box of matches she wisely brought with her from the future, and she dines on a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich.\n\nThe next morning, though, she\u2019s in a lot of pain and looks rather ashen. As she lurches through the forest, she notices smoke from a house\u2019s chimney in the distance. But before she can do anything about it, she passes out.\n\nBE LEERY, IT\u2019S LAOGHAIRE! | Bree dreams/remembers herself as young girl, with Frank (hi, Tobias Menzies!) gently lifting her out of a car she\u2019d fallen asleep in. When she actually wakes, she\u2019s tucked into a bed in a cozy home, and Laoghaire \u2014 !!! \u2014 was her savior.\n\nThe wenchiest wench who ever wenched Laoghaire and Joanie were walking home, it turns out, when they found Bree near a tree. \u201cWe had no choice but to bring you home with us,\u201d the older woman explains, introducing herself and her younger daughter and telling Bree she can stay as long as she needs to. Brianna tells them she\u2019s from England but her parents are in North Carolina, and that she\u2019s going to meet them there. \u201cMarsali\u2019s in North Carolina!\u201d Joanie pipes up.\n\nA note before we move on: In Drums of Autumn, Brianna shows up at Lallybroch first. That\u2019s where she meets Ian and Jenny, and her first interaction with Laoghaire is decidedly different (read: Bree knows who she is right away, and she shocks everyone by announcing that Laoghaire was behind the business at Cranesmuir. In short, they yell at each other a lot). \u201cWe had plans to go to Lallybroch and do certain things,\u201d executive producer Matthew B. Roberts told me, \u201cand then through actor availability we were unable to tell the story exactly the way that we wanted to. So we had to revamp.\u201d\n\nSHIPPIN\u2019 OUT | Back in 1969, Roger and Fiona drive to Craig na Dun. He\u2019s shaved his beard and dressed in period garb in preparation for his trip, and he\u2019s got money, a compass, a knife and some gemstones to see him safely into the past. As they walk toward the circle, he hears a buzzing, but Fiona can\u2019t. \u201cThe stones dinna call to me,\u201d she reminds him. They hug, then he walks toward the stone and puts his palms on it. Later, Fi!\n\nWe don\u2019t see him again until he\u2019s in the 1700s, seeking passage to the Carolinas. Oh look, Roger has found himself another knit cap. Joy. The captain of the Gloriana \u2014 wait a minute, it\u2019s Stephen Bonnet! \u2014 says he\u2019s going to Wilmington but isn\u2019t accepting any more passengers. So Roger hoists a barrel over his shoulder to prove that he\u2019s hale and hearty enough to join the crew. Bonnet looks amused, so he flips a coin to decide whether or not Rog can come aboard. When the toss comes out in Roger\u2019s favor, Bonnet snarks, \u201cThere\u2019s four ports before Wilmington. I hope she\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nA VERRA INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT | Her first night at Laoghaire\u2019s, Ian comes to give Laoghaire some money. But it\u2019s not the full amount of monthly alimony Jamie owes her, and she\u2019s verra testy about that. The next morning, Bree dons one of Marsali\u2019s dresses and comes to help Laoghaire and Joanie in the garden. That\u2019s where the little girl tells her about her \u201cDa,\u201d who raised her but wasn\u2019t her biological father. The two redheads bond over being brought up by good men who weren\u2019t in love with their mothers.\n\nAnd that leads us to a very intriguing flashback set right around the time of Brianna\u2019s high school graduation. The teen finds her father in his office at Harvard, drunk-ish and despondent. He won\u2019t say precisely why, but when Bree asks what some papers on his desk are, we can see that he had a copy of Claire and Jamie\u2019s death notice \u2014 the same one Roger and Bree found independently of each other \u2014 way back then. He brushes it off as \u201cresearch from a colleague in Scotland,\u201d and when she presses, only adding that it\u2019s \u201ccomplicated.\u201d He eventually sends her home, and she leaves in a huff.\n\nTHIS IS INTERESTING, NO, OLDLANDERS? In the books, we learn that Frank knew Jamie survived the Battle of Culloden, but it\u2019s unclear how much more research he did after that. But this slight change indicates that Frank not only knew Jamie eventually died in North Carolina\u2026 but that Claire was with him when it happened. So you can look at this scene as Frank realizing that no matter what he does, Claire is destined to leave him again and go back through the stones. It also might explain why \u2014 in Season 3 and in another flashback in this episode \u2014 he pushes so hard for Brianna to move to England with him: If Claire is going to leave them, they might as well make that break on their own terms, possibly sparing Bree a little of the pain? Or maybe he\u2019s doing it to make things easier for Claire, to tie up some loose ends ahead of time?\n\nOf course, he doesn\u2019t tell Brianna any of this. And when he announces the divorce and pitches the move, she soundly rejects both. \u201cSometimes, life takes unexpected turns. And when it does, you know what we do? We soldier on,\u201d he tells her, but she\u2019s very upset and leaves so they can\u2019t discuss it further. Sadly, we know that this is just before he gets into the car accident, meaning that their last conversation was an angry one. Much later, at his graveside, Brianna cries as she promises him she\u2019ll \u201csoldier on.\u201d\n\nTHE TRUTH COMES OUT | Bree\u2019s sojourn at Laoghaire\u2019s house is going along swimmingly until the blonde mentions Lallybroch. Brianna perks up and says that her relatives live there and her mother spent time there. \u201cAnd who might your mother be?\u201d Laoghaire politely inquires. \u201cClaire Fraser,\u201d Bree answers. Hold onto yer stomachers, because it\u2019s going to get wild in here! Laoghaire\u2019s manner goes from maternal to brittle REAL fast. Without letting on that she knows precisely who Bree\u2019s mama is, the blonde besom starts talking smack about how Jamie left Claire when he found out she was pregnant. \u201cI dinna like to repeat such things myself,\u201d she adds, airily, which makes me guffaw.\n\n\u201cI can prevent their deaths if I go to them now. There\u2019s going to be a fire,\u201d Bree says, which immediately makes Laoghaire suspicious. Um, Brianna? First rule of time-travel club? DON\u2019T TALK ABOUT TIME-TRAVEL CLUB. Ultimately, Laoghaire only wants the money she\u2019s owed, and she fears that the Frasers sent Bree there to spy on her. \u201cYour mother is the thieving whore who stole my husband and left me destitute!\u201d she yells, and things only get louder from there.\n\nWhen Bree goes to pack her things, Laoghaire follows her. \u201cClaire Fraser should have burnt at the stake in Cranesmuir,\u201d she spits. A penny drops for Brianna: \u201cOh my God: You\u2019re the one who tried to have my mother killed!\u201d In Laoghaire\u2019s mind, this just cements the notion that Bree is just the latest witch in Claire\u2019s coven, and she says as much. \u201cI\u2019m sure believing that is easier than facing the truth. And the truth is that Jamie Fraser has never loved you,\u201d Bree shoots back. So Laoghaire locks her in the bedroom and says she\u2019ll have her guest arrested for witchcraft.\n\nBONNET\u2019S A BADDIE | On the Gloriana, Roger is friendly with a female passenger who\u2019s traveling with an infant. That night, he\u2019s awakened by a woman\u2019s scream, and he runs to see what\u2019s up. A young girl passenger has smallpox, and her mother is begging Bonnet not to toss her out the window to stem the spread of the disease. Roger begs Bonnet, as well, but the stone-cold captain pushes the child into the icy waters. Her mother dives in after her. They\u2019re both doomed. As Roger reels in shock, Bonnet orders the crew to examine everyone and bring him anyone who\u2019s ill.\n\nThe infant\u2019s mother, whose name is Morag MacKenzie, freaks out: The baby is teething, which makes him seem like he\u2019s poxed, but he\u2019s not. So Roger promises to hide her and baby Jemmy and bring them food, a plan that Bonnet eventually realizes and confronts them both. \u201cWould you say you\u2019re a gambling man, MacKenzie?\u201d Bonnet asks, flipping a coin to see whether Roger lives or dies. It comes out in his favor; Bonnet leaves them alone.\n\nBREE MEETS HER UNCLE | Bree has just managed to get a window of her new prison open when wee Joanie unlocks the door and drives her over to Lallybroch. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault your mother is a witch,\u201d the little girl tells her. What a good kid!\n\nJenny\u2019s away helping birth a grandchild, but Ian is at home when Bree arrives. He instantly believes what she says, noting that she has Claire\u2019s eyes, and calls her \u201can unexpected blessing.\u201d Then he gives her money to buy passage to the colonies, a trunk full of Claire\u2019s old clothes and a tip to find Jocasta at River Run when she arrives in North Carolina. Man, Ian is always, always the best.\n\nAt the port, just before Bree books passage, she\u2019s approached by a man named Joseph Wemyss who begs her to take his daughter on as a servant. Brianna is uninterested, but his story about how another man will buy the girl and keep her as a concubine sways her a bit. So pretty soon Brianna and Lizzie Wemyss (who looks nothing like I pictured her from the book, but whatever) are both heading out to board the Philip Alonso.\n\nBefore they get on the ship, Brianna takes a look back and imagines Frank standing there and nodding fondly at her. Then she turns around and heads into her next adventure.\n\nNow it\u2019s your turn. What did you think of the episode?

Check out the previous\u00a0Outlander\u00a0recap here.\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nBoth Brianna and Roger make the leap through time in this week's Outlander, thank goodness. It's been fun watching Jamie and Claire channel Bob Vila and all, but I'm ready for the Frasers and Rog all to be in one place (and century) so that the joyful reunions, tearful misunderstandings and 18th-century game of telephone* can get underway!\r\n\r\nOn a related note, this week's episode brings back two characters we haven't seen in a while: Frank and Laoghaire. For the first time, particularly in Laoghaire's case, we see aspects of both that don't come to light when the story is told from Claire's perspective. Also: Nell Hudson doesn't get nearly enough credit for how masterfully she plays Jamie's ex-wife.\r\n\r\nBut wait, before I forget: Did Frank\u00a0know Claire was destined to go back in time again?\r\n\r\nRead on for the highlights of \"Down the Rabbit Hole.\"\r\n\r\n*Don't know what I'm talking about? You will, and soon!\r\n\r\nBRIANNA ARRIVES | Brianna, who definitely made it back to old-timey Scotland, walks through the Highlands in the snow. She occasionally consults an old map, but she's a long way from anything even slightly resembling civilization. At one point, she falls and severely hurts her ankle; when she soaks it in an icy stream to stem the swelling, we see that it's badly sprained. But she pushes on, limping along a road and sleeping under the stars. She's able to start a fire using a box of matches she wisely brought with her from the future, and she dines on a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, though, she's in a lot of pain and looks rather ashen. As she lurches through the forest, she notices smoke from a house's chimney in the distance. But before she can do anything about it, she passes out.\r\n\r\nBE LEERY, IT'S LAOGHAIRE! | Bree dreams/remembers herself as young girl, with Frank (hi, Tobias Menzies!) gently lifting her out of a car she'd fallen asleep in. When she actually wakes, she's tucked into a bed in a cozy home, and Laoghaire \u2014 !!! \u2014\u00a0was her savior.\r\n\r\nThe wenchiest wench who ever wenched Laoghaire and Joanie were walking home, it turns out, when they found Bree near a tree. \"We had no choice but to bring you home with us,\" the older woman explains, introducing herself and her younger daughter and telling Bree she can stay as long as she needs to. Brianna tells them she's from England but her parents are in North Carolina, and that she's going to meet them there. \"Marsali's in North Carolina!\" Joanie pipes up.\r\n\r\nA note before we move on: In Drums of Autumn, Brianna shows up at Lallybroch first. That's where she meets Ian and Jenny, and her first interaction with Laoghaire is decidedly different (read: Bree knows who she is right away, and she shocks everyone by announcing that Laoghaire was behind the business at Cranesmuir. In short, they yell at each other a lot). \"We had plans to go to Lallybroch and do certain things,\" executive producer Matthew B. Roberts told me, \"and then through actor availability we were unable to tell the story exactly the way that we wanted to. So we had to revamp.\"\r\n\r\nSHIPPIN' OUT | Back in 1969, Roger and Fiona drive to Craig na Dun. He's shaved his beard and dressed in period garb in preparation for his trip, and he's got money, a compass, a knife and some gemstones to see him safely into the past. As they walk toward the circle, he hears a buzzing, but Fiona can't. \"The stones dinna call to me,\" she reminds him. They hug, then he walks toward the stone and puts his palms on it. Later, Fi!\r\n\r\nWe don't see him again until he's in the 1700s, seeking passage to the Carolinas. Oh look, Roger has found himself another knit cap. Joy. The captain of the Gloriana \u2014\u00a0wait a minute, it's Stephen Bonnet! \u2014\u00a0says he's going to Wilmington but isn't accepting any more passengers. So Roger hoists a barrel over his shoulder to prove that he's hale and hearty enough to join the crew. Bonnet looks amused, so he flips a coin to decide whether or not Rog can come aboard. When the toss comes out in Roger's favor, Bonnet snarks, \"There's four ports before Wilmington. I hope she's worth it.\"\r\n\r\nA VERRA INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT | Her first night at Laoghaire's, Ian comes to give Laoghaire some money. But it's not the full amount of monthly alimony Jamie owes her, and she's verra testy about that. The next morning, Bree dons one of Marsali's dresses and comes to help Laoghaire and Joanie in the garden. That's where the little girl tells her about her \"Da,\" who raised her but wasn't her biological father. The two redheads bond over being brought up by good men who weren't in love with their mothers.\r\n\r\nAnd that leads us to a very intriguing flashback set right around the time of Brianna's high school graduation. The teen finds her father in his office at Harvard, drunk-ish and despondent. He won't say precisely why, but when Bree asks what some papers on his desk are, we can see that he had a copy of Claire and Jamie's death notice \u2014 the same one Roger and Bree found independently of each other \u2014\u00a0way back then. He brushes it off as \"research from a colleague in Scotland,\" and when she presses, only adding that it's \"complicated.\" He eventually sends her home, and she leaves in a huff.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS INTERESTING, NO, OLDLANDERS? In the books, we learn that Frank knew Jamie survived the Battle of Culloden, but it's unclear how much more research he did after that. But this slight change indicates that Frank not only knew Jamie eventually died in North Carolina\u2026 but that Claire was with him when it happened. So you can look at this scene as Frank realizing that no matter what he does, Claire is destined to leave him again and go back through the stones. It also might explain why \u2014 in Season 3 and in another flashback in this episode \u2014 he pushes so hard for Brianna to move to England with him: If Claire is going to leave them, they might as well make that break on their own terms, possibly sparing Bree a little of the pain? Or maybe he's doing it to make things easier for Claire, to tie up some loose ends ahead of time?\r\n\r\nOf course, he doesn\u2019t tell Brianna any of this. And when he announces the divorce and pitches the move, she soundly rejects both. \"Sometimes, life takes unexpected turns. And when it does, you know what we do? We soldier on,\" he tells her, but she's very upset and leaves so they can't discuss it further. Sadly, we know that this is just before he gets into the car accident, meaning that their last conversation was an angry one. Much later, at his graveside, Brianna cries as she promises him she'll \"soldier on.\"\r\n\r\nTHE TRUTH COMES OUT | Bree's sojourn at Laoghaire's house is going along swimmingly until the blonde mentions Lallybroch. Brianna perks up and says that her relatives live there and her mother spent time there. \"And who might your mother be?\" Laoghaire politely inquires. \"Claire Fraser,\" Bree answers. Hold onto yer stomachers, because it's going to get wild in here! Laoghaire's manner goes from maternal to brittle REAL fast. Without letting on that she knows precisely who Bree's mama is, the blonde besom starts talking smack about how Jamie left Claire when he found out she was pregnant. \"I dinna like to repeat such things myself,\" she adds, airily, which makes me guffaw.\r\n\r\n\"I can prevent their deaths if I go to them now. There's going to be a fire,\" Bree says, which immediately makes Laoghaire suspicious. Um, Brianna? First rule of time-travel club? DON'T TALK ABOUT TIME-TRAVEL CLUB. Ultimately, Laoghaire only wants the money she's owed, and she fears that the Frasers sent Bree there to spy on her. \"Your mother is the thieving whore who stole my husband and left me destitute!\" she yells, and things only get louder from there.\r\n\r\nWhen Bree goes to pack her things, Laoghaire follows her. \"Claire Fraser should have burnt at the stake in Cranesmuir,\" she spits. A penny drops for Brianna: \"Oh my God: You're the one who tried to have my mother killed!\" In Laoghaire's mind, this just cements the notion that Bree is just the latest witch in Claire's coven, and she says as much. \"I'm sure believing that is easier than facing the truth. And the truth is that Jamie Fraser has never loved you,\" Bree shoots back. So Laoghaire locks her in the bedroom and says she'll have her guest arrested for witchcraft.\r\n\r\nBONNET'S A BADDIE | On the Gloriana, Roger is friendly with a female passenger who's traveling with an infant. That night, he's awakened by a woman's scream, and he runs to see what's up. A young girl passenger has smallpox, and her mother is begging Bonnet not to toss her out the window to stem the spread of the disease. Roger begs Bonnet, as well, but the stone-cold captain pushes the child into the icy waters. Her mother dives in after her. They're both doomed. As Roger reels in shock, Bonnet orders the crew to examine everyone and bring him anyone who's ill.\r\n\r\nThe infant's mother, whose name is Morag MacKenzie, freaks out: The baby is teething, which makes him seem like he's poxed, but he's not. So Roger promises to hide her and baby Jemmy and bring them food, a plan that Bonnet eventually realizes and confronts them both. \"Would you say you're a gambling man, MacKenzie?\" Bonnet asks, flipping a coin to see whether Roger lives or dies. It comes out in his favor; Bonnet leaves them alone.\r\n\r\nBREE MEETS HER UNCLE | Bree has just managed to get a window of her new prison open when wee Joanie unlocks the door and drives her over to Lallybroch. \"It's not your fault your mother is a witch,\" the little girl tells her. What a good kid!\r\n\r\nJenny's away helping birth a grandchild, but Ian is at home when Bree arrives. He instantly believes what she says, noting that she has Claire's eyes, and calls her \"an unexpected blessing.\" Then he gives her money to buy passage to the colonies, a trunk full of Claire's old clothes and a tip to find Jocasta at River Run when she arrives in North Carolina. Man, Ian is always, always the best.\r\n\r\nAt the port, just before Bree books passage, she's approached by a man named Joseph Wemyss who begs her to take his daughter on as a servant. Brianna is uninterested, but his story about how another man will buy the girl and keep her as a concubine sways her a bit. So pretty soon Brianna and Lizzie Wemyss (who looks nothing like I pictured her from the book, but whatever) are both heading out to board the Philip Alonso.\r\n\r\nBefore they get on the ship, Brianna takes a look back and imagines Frank standing there and nodding fondly at her. Then she turns around and heads into her next adventure.\r\n\r\nNow it's your turn. What did you think of the episode?
