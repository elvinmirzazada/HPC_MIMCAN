So let\u2019s get straight to that. Annnnnnd of course we have to replay the whole stupid scene again. Andy and Kyle seem to think this is hilarious. Andy just wants to be sure he gets the bunny for the clubhouse. If Kim was so afraid of the bad bunny energy in her house, why did she keep possession (pun intended) of the damn thing for weeks on end?\n\nRinna has one of the best props ever it\u2019s a little blue box that you press like a remote and it says Fuck You! I need this in my life. Rinna says that Kim just wants to be on the show and she is her meal ticket. I have to say that when Kim was IN MY OPINION near death, I set a Google alert on her. It\u2019s the only Google Alert I have. I used to cringe when they would come through because it was always something bad. For the last year or so, I only get one when she in on RHOBH and Rinna\u2019s name is always on it too. Rinna has a lot of other publicity. Kim only has Rinna.\n\nDorit the idiot opens her mouth and I scream at her to shut up louder than Rinna did. Just shut the fuck up Dorit, this has nothing to do with you. Just shut the fuck up.\n\nAndy is going to need to change pants several times he is so orgasmic about all the verbal jabs flying back and forth. Then he joins in with an imaginary question harking back to Kyle saying in the limo at the end of season one that Maurice takes care of Kim like a second wife and she still treats them badly. The question was, \u201cHow is that not enabling?\u201d Kyle is very thrown by the question. Kyle doesn\u2019t really know what an enabler is. She thinks it is just about giving the addict alcohol.\n\nEileen sticks up for Rinna. Kim is overtalking everyone. All of these scenes where Kim is trotted out do not make her look sober. In my opinion.\n\nI think this is Round Four Xanax v. Coke. How the hell do I pick a side here? Can I have some of both? Dorit literally makes no sense when she tried to tell her side. Rinna says the Xanax story was in the press and she has kids. And then Kim says it\u2019s in the press about me too and it hurts my kids. Yes Kim, multiple arrests, fleeing multiple rehabs under cover of darkness, disrupting your kids wedding and appearing to be unhinged in public all while not completing your court appointed sentence is exactly the same as Rinna joking about having a Xanax smoothie. It\u2019s totally the same.\n\nAndy tries to wrap things up and hopefully get Kim off the stage, but Eileen interrupts and wants to know why Kim thinking being on a soap opera is an insult. Kim says that soap operas are more dramatic. Eileen asks Kim, \u201cHave you seen yourself on TV?\u201d Kim is the most overly dramatic person on any franchise and Eileen is frequently called boring because she is not dramatic at all in real life.\n\nIs Eileen only wearing one super long earring on purpose or did she lose one?\n\nLVP hasn\u2019t said twenty words this entire reunion. Why should she when Dorit will say it all? She really had no storyline other than animals and kids. The found Max\u2019s mother through a PI. Max says he wants to meet his birth mother to than her for giving him up. LVP is fine with it. It sort of sounds like LVP wants to have him communicate through an intermediary. A viewer tried to give LVP shit for giving Max his own place. If you listen closely to the recording you hear her say he still has to pay the mortgage on the place. I don\u2019t have a problem with her doing that at all, if she can afford it. It\u2019s also a good way to hide assets by selling the property at a loss to your child for tax purposes. Or putting it in a family trust. She also got grief for not consoling Ken when he was crying about dogs. LVP and Eileen seem good. Maybe not really good. But good.\n\nAndy ribs Rinna (SWIDT?) about posting a nude on Instagram. She says she loves the attention but the girls made her take it down. Harry didn\u2019t know about it. We go right into another segment about Rinna. Because RINNA IS THE DAMN SHOW. Andy seems impressed that both her girls are high fashion models. Erika recently had dinner with Yolanda.\n\nEveryone loves Harry. And his meat. And his pies. Harry watches all the shows and often tells Rinna, \u201cYou just can\u2019t help yourself, can you?\u201d\n\nIt seems that with the exception of Rinna and Kim, and perhaps Rinna and Eden and also Rinna and Dorit \u2026 everyone gets along well enough.\n\nAndy takes the bunny for the clubhouse whether they want him to or not.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n", "images":
