It was too heavy a burden to carry and I simply couldn\u2019t do that anymore\u2026 I sought and received treatment, I put positive people around me and I got back to doing what I love \u2014 writing songs and making music. As hard as this is, I also knew it was time to finally share my story.\u201d\n\nCarey says she\u2019s in therapy and on medication for bipolar II disorder, which involves periods of depression as well as hypomania (less severe than the mania associated with bipolar I, but can still cause irritability, sleeplessness and hyperactivity)\n\nRELATED VIDEO: PEOPLE Exclusive: Mariah Carey Is Managing Her Bipolar Disorder With Medication & Therapy\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually taking medication that seems to be pretty good. It\u2019s not making me feel too tired or sluggish or anything like that.
