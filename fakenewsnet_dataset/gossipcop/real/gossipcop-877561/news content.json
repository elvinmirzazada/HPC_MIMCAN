Just a few days before Justin Bieber announced his own hurricane donation, the Red Cross Los Angeles confirmed that the \u201cWhat About Us\u201d singer gave $500,000 to its charity.\n\nOn Friday, the organization shouted out Pink\u2019s incredible gift on Twitter, expressing gratitude at the singer\u2019s show of support towards those who have been displaced or otherwise affected by the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, which produced historic flooding in Houston and the surrounding areas when it made landfall on August 25.\n\n\u201cThank you @Pink from the bottom of our \u2764\ufe0f for your donation of a half million dollars to @RedCross #HurricaneHarvey relief efforts!\u201d the organization tweeted.\n\nThank you @Pink from the bottom of our \u2764\ufe0f for your donation of a half million dollars to @RedCross #HurricaneHarvey relief efforts! \u2014 Red Cross LosAngeles (@RedCrossLA) September 2, 2017\n\nThe organization also posted a video of its staff members thanking Pink for her generous gesture.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re partial to red, but pink is great, too.

It absolutely warms our hearts to see celebrities continue to step up and show compassion to the victims of Hurricane Harvey during following has to be one of the most traumatic experiences ever, and what will surely be a very long and arduous recovery process.\n\nSince the storm tore through the Texas coast and forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes, we\u2019ve witnessed a non-stop outpouring of support from celebs like Drake, Sandra Bullock, Kevin Hart, and Zendaya, who have all made sizable donations and rallied for others to make contributions as well.\n\nWe can only hope that the flood victims are as encouraged by these efforts as we are.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/04011448/pink-700x525.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/04011448/pink.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852im_/http://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hg/images/xoxo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/03041850/prince-e1504462781453-350x350.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/03232954/duke-and-duchess-of-cambridge-350x350.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852im_/http://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hg/images/illustrations/3.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852im_/http://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hg/images/newsletter-illustration.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/30105653/toast-350x350.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/04011448/pink.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kenya Foy"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852/http://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/pink-donated-huge-amount-money-harvey-relief/", "title": "Pink just donated a *huge* amount of money to Harvey relief", "meta_data": {"fb": {"admins": 100001889240714, "pages": 209123339112078}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@hellogiggles", "creator": "@kgedits", "title": "Pink just donated a *huge* amount of money to Harvey relief", "description": "She joins a growing list of celebs who have been opening their checkbooks to help out.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/04011448/pink-376x283.jpg"}, "description": "The \"What About Us\" singer is the latest celebrity to lend a huge helping hand to the people impacted by Hurricane Harvey.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pink just donated a *huge* amount of money to Harvey relief", "description": "She joins a growing list of celebs who have been opening their checkbooks to help out.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852/http://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/pink-donated-huge-amount-money-harvey-relief/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170905113852im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/09/04011448/pink.jpg", "width": 3000, "height": 2309}}, "article": {"tag": "donations", "section": "Celeb", "published_time": "2017-09-04T08:50:34-07:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.8.1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504540234.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
