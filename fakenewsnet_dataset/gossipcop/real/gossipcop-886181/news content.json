Lets go get em,\u201d the mother of three wrote, paraphrasing her husband\u2019s words that kick off the track.\n\nThe star also posted GIFs from the single\u2019s music video as part of three consecutive posts in regular Beyonc\u00e9 fashion.\n\nIn the music video, Beyonc\u00e9 appeared as JAY-Z\u2019s girlfriend and it fueled speculation about their then-secret relationship. Nearly six years later, in April 2008, the pair married in a secret wedding ceremony.\n\nI can\u2019t believe its been 15years since Bonnie and Clyde \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd You ready \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe?

The footage also featured cameos from Jake Gyllenhaal, Blake Lively and Rashida Jones.\n\nFast forward to the present, Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z are parents to three children: 5-year-old daughter Blue Ivy and 3-month-old twins Rumi and Sir. And the superstar duo has been spending most of their time in Los Angeles, after moving to the West Coast from New York City in 2015.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screen-shot-2017-10-10-at-11-10-22-am.png?crop=68px%2C0px%2C686px%2C458.96666666667px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/janet-jackson4.jpg?crop=0px%2C570px%2C2000px%2C1339px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/richie-sambora.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C1500px%2C1003px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eminem.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1332.7428571429px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/deliliah-zack-1-2000a.jpg?crop=0px%2C165px%2C2000px%2C1338px&resize=420%2C281", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/big-sean.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1373px%2C918.60238095238px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/beyonce-jay-z.jpg?crop=287px%2C31px%2C1594px%2C836px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/416418724_5604130090001_5604103598001-vs.jpg?crop=102px%2C0px%2C1076px%2C719.89523809524px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/tom-petty-41.jpg?crop=219px%2C76px%2C1209px%2C809px&resize=420%2C281"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/beyonce-jay-z.jpg?crop=287px%2C31px%2C1594px%2C836px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519/http://people.com/music/beyonce-jay-z-bonnie-clyde-15-year-anniversary/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 \u2018Can\u2019t Believe\u2019 It\u2019s Been 15 Years Since She and Husband JAY-Z Released \u2018Bonnie & Clyde\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1143086910", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9's first solo recording was a feature on husband Jay-Z's \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002", "keywords": "jay-z, beyonce, bonnie and clyde, beyonce husband, jay-z wife,", "news_keywords": "jay-z, beyonce, bonnie and clyde, beyonce husband, jay-z wife,", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 \u2018Can\u2019t Believe\u2019 It\u2019s Been 15 Years Since She and Husband JAY-Z Released \u2018Bonnie & Clyde\u2019", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519/http://people.com/music/beyonce-jay-z-bonnie-clyde-15-year-anniversary/", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first solo recording was a feature on husband Jay-Z\u2019s \u201c\u201903 Bonnie & Clyde\u201d that was released in October 2002", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171011055519im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/beyonce-jay-z.jpg?crop=287px%2C31px%2C1594px%2C836px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-11T00:47:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-11T00:50:45+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@people", "creator": "@people"}, "application-name": "PEOPLE.com", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://people.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/a39c9d87d3ee529a684f7a5b3b557adc?s=16"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507682876.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
