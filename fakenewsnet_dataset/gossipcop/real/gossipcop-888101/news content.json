Harding went on to win the U.S. championship, but finished eighth at the Olympics in Lillehammer, while Kerrigan recovered from a bruised knee to win the silver medal behind Oksana Baiul.\n\nAlamy Stock Harding wore several memorable costumes during her career in the 1990s, which came to an end after an attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan.\n\nGillooly, Stant and Eckhardt all served prison time for the attack, while Harding was given three years probation. She also was banned for life by the U.S. Figure Skating Association.\n\nThose troubles appeared to be in the distant past on Tuesday, when she received a loud ovation from the audience at the premiere at the Egyptian Theatre.\n\nFollow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302183/tonya-harding-today-inline-004-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.today-inline-large.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302184/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-inline-003-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.today-inline-large.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302185/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-inline-002-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.today-inline-large.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540im_/https://nodeassets.today.com/cdnassets/today-images/tdy-header-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540im_/https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201701/2017-01-17T13-15-43-9Z--1280x720.today-inline-vid-featured-desktop.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302186/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-inline-001-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.today-inline-large.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540im_/https://c.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2017_49/1302187/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-tease-001-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540im_/https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_06/403986/1c6848557-stump-photo-2_b8b89d87c3973798d4c7d50ecd76e3b2.today-byline.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2017_49/1302187/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-tease-001-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Scott Stump"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540/https://www.today.com/popculture/tonya-harding-walks-red-carpet-margot-robbie-i-tonya-premiere-t119749", "title": "Tonya Harding walks the red carpet with Margot Robbie at 'I, Tonya' premiere", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width initial-scale=1 maximum-scale=1 user-scalable=no", "msvalidate.01": "43434ADDF3F60D7897F819F388E2FADF", "author": "Scott Stump", "og": {"description": "The former U.S. Olympic figure skater mingled with Margot Robbie, Allison Janney and the rest of the cast of \"I, Tonya,'' a movie about her life.", "title": "Tonya Harding walks the red carpet at 'I, Tonya' premiere", "site_name": "TODAY.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540im_/https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/i/newscms/2017_49/1302187/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-tease-001-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.jpg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171208013540/https://www.today.com/popculture/tonya-harding-walks-red-carpet-margot-robbie-i-tonya-premiere-t119749"}, "description": "The former U.S. Olympic figure skater mingled with Margot Robbie, Allison Janney and the rest of the cast of \"I, Tonya,'' a movie about her life.", "twitter": {"title": "Tonya Harding walks the red carpet at 'I, Tonya' premiere", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TodayShow", "description": "The former U.S. Olympic figure skater mingled with Margot Robbie, Allison Janney and the rest of the cast of \"I, Tonya,'' a movie about her life.", "creator": "@TodayShow", "domain": "TODAY.com", "image": {"src": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302187/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-tease-001-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.today-inline-vid-featured-desktop.jpg"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "parsely-post-id": 119749, "news_keywords": "Pop Culture,Movies", "google-site-verification": "uDRXhvw8LRHhorJhIUmXCkUPjqGebM6KFh9jZGwH6VA", "DC.date.issued": "2017-12-07T13:04:54.000Z", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699, affiliate-data=ct=todaycom_sb&pt=211554, app-argument=https://www.today.com/popculture/tonya-harding-walks-red-carpet-margot-robbie-i-tonya-premiere-t119749"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
