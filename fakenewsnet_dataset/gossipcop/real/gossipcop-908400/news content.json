She said that she enjoys hearing the reactions from \"Lady Bird\" fans who relate to the relationship between her character Marion and her free-spirited daughter Lady Bird, played by Saoirse Ronan.\n\n\"That\u2019s been wonderful to have mothers and daughters come up and say they've seen the movie together and they've had an epiphany throughout it, you know, seeing each other through different eyes,\" she said.\n\nThe movie also resonated in Metcalf's own household when she watched the film with her teenage daughter.\n\n\"My older daughter and I had the side-eye glances at each other throughout the movie because she's heard me say and she has said [things], if not verbatim, but very close to some of the lines that are in the movie,\" she said with a laugh.\n\n\"Lady Bird\" scored five Oscar nominations in total, including best picture, best actress for Saoirse Ronan and best director for Greta Gerwig.\n\nSara Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf and Roseanne Barr appear in a scene from \"Roseanne.\"\n\nMetcalf will back on the small screen when \"Roseanne\" returns to ABC on March 27.\n\nThe 90th Annual Academy Awards airs live on ABC Sunday night starting at 8 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/random/svg/gma_logo.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/laurie-metcalf-gty-jpo-180228_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/rosalynn-carter-funeral-14-gty-jef-231129_1701284648791_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/israel-gaza-9-gty-gmh-231128_1701184678034_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/laurie-metcalf-ht-jpo-180228_23x13_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/pence-trump3-file-gty-ml-231127_1701110318739_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/roseanne-gty-001-jpo-180228_3x2_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/deutsche-bank-logo-gty-ps-231012_1697114884556_hpMain_3_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/images/hulu.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/rockefeller-tree-ap-jef-231128_1701183464711_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/laurie-metcalf-gty-jpo-180228_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/laurie-metcalf-lady-bird-oscar-nom-hadnt-planned/story?id=53413916", "title": "'Lady Bird' actress Laurie Metcalf on Oscar nomination: 'I just hadn\u2019t planned on it ever happening to me'", "meta_data": {"description": "\"Lady Bird\" star Laurie Metcalf never planned on getting an Oscar nomination.", "keywords": "Oscars, Academy Awards, Lady Bird, Laurie Metcalf, Oscar nomination , Article, 53413916", "copyright": "2023 ABC News", "author": "ABC News", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "'Lady Bird' actress Laurie Metcalf on Oscar nomination: 'I just hadn\u2019t planned on it ever happening to me'", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/laurie-metcalf-lady-bird-oscar-nom-hadnt-planned/story?id=53413916", "title": "'Lady Bird' actress Laurie Metcalf on Oscar nomination: 'I just hadn\u2019t planned on it ever happening to me'", "description": "\"Lady Bird\" star Laurie Metcalf never planned on getting an Oscar nomination.", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/laurie-metcalf-gty-jpo-180228_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "lastPublishedDate": "2018-02-28T19:11:26Z", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,53413916", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,53413916", "googleplay": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/laurie-metcalf-lady-bird-oscar-nom-hadnt-planned/story?id=53413916"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "ABC News", "title": "'Lady Bird' actress Laurie Metcalf on Oscar nomination: 'I just hadn\u2019t planned on it ever happening to me'", "description": "\"Lady Bird\" star Laurie Metcalf never planned on getting an Oscar nomination.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/laurie-metcalf-lady-bird-oscar-nom-hadnt-planned/story?id=53413916", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/laurie-metcalf-gty-jpo-180228_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,53413916", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News -
