Yeah, me too. Those tracksuits were so fetch during most of the 2000s, but like all trends, people eventually moved on to other, less match-y things. By 2014, the original Juicy Couture owners had peaced out and Juicy closed all of the U.S. boutiques, which would explain why you haven't seen Kim K wearing a set in recent years.\n\nAccording to WWD though, Juicy Couture is teaming up with to relaunch the low-rise velour pants with matching fitted zip-up jackets for a limited designer capsule collection. The campaign is called #TrackIsBack, and it's giving me all the nostalgia feels.\n\nGetty\n\nIn the article, Bloomingdale's vice chairman Frank Doroff says, \"Juicy was the originator of ath-leisure, a trend that resonates with our customers and has a strong presence in our fall 2016 assortment.\" Although Juicy Couture wasn't the first brand to make tracksuits a thing, the fact that they had every celebrity in 2004 wearing velour pants with sequins and foil-printed catchphrases emblazoned on the butt definitely proves its influence in the fashion world.\n\nGetty\n\nCome July, you'll be able to purchase a new set in seven different colors at Bloomingdale's stores and online. The pants will be available in a slim or flare style for $88, and you can choose a hoodie or collar jacket for $108. Just like the good ol' days.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nGet non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed.
