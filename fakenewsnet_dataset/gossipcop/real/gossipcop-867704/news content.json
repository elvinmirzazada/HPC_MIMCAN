We were, however, surprised to see her boys, Nelson and Eddy, looking all grown up!\n\nThe boys were dressed casual-cool as they stopped to pose for photographers with their famous mom.\n\nCeline Dion went shopping in Paris with her 6-year-old twins and they're all grown up! https://t.co/V9kDtstO0w pic.twitter.com/HRNUZZEiTa \u2014 EntertainmentTonight (@etnow) July 19, 2017\n\nAlthough the twins are fraternal, they have always looked pretty identical to us. But now that they're older, we can see that Nelson (left) is looking more and more like mom, while Eddy (right) looks like his papa, the late Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil.\n\nDion has been enjoying her time in Paris this summer. Not only has she been spending time with her kids in the City of Love, but she's also posed for a number of high-fashion photo shoots, including a stunning nude photo for Vogue.\n\nA post shared by Vogue (@voguemagazine) on Jul 3, 2017 at 10:25pm PDT\n\nThe 49-year-old mom always includes her kids in everything she does. Last month, the \"My Heart Will Go On\" singer shared photos from her European tour revealing snaps of her three children \u2014 16-year-old Ren\u00e9-Charles and twins Eddy and Nelson \u2014 displayed proudly behind her while she performed.\n\n\"Music is a family affair,\" she wrote. \"So proud that my boys are in on the action!\"\n\nA post shared by C\u00e9line Dion (@celinedion) on Jun 27, 2017 at 7:14am PDT\n\nSince Dion's husband Ang\u00e9lil passed away last year, the singer has been adamant that her kids come first.\n\n\"What makes me most proud is to be a mother,\" she told Extra earlier this year. \"I have three magnificent kids, that through them, I see my husband and I have the strength today to keep dressing up.\"", "images":
