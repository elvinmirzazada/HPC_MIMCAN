I read the song and I go, \u2018Babe, it sounds like they\u2019re talking about us.\u2019 And she goes, \u2018Yeah! They made it for me.\u2019 I heard it for the first time and I knew it was going to be a smash the first time I heard it.\u201d\n\nFallon then pressed, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a giant hit, but now everyone\u2019s probably going to ask you, 'Where\u2019s the ring?' Where is it? Are you thinking about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about it,\u201d Rodriguez said, coyly adding, \u201cWhen it happens, Jimmy, you\u2019ll be the first to know!\u201d\n\nLopez hammed it up for Rodriguez on Wednesday\u2019s Tonight Show, talking about the new song.\n\n\u201cNo pressure!\u201d she said. \u201cThe song is definitely about that, it is, but I felt like it was kind of something that all women get to a point where they say, \u2018OK, what\u2019s up?\u2019 [points to ring finger] Like, we\u2019re good, everything\u2019s great, what\u2019s going on? Am I staying or am I [going]?\u2019\u201d\n\nLopez and Rodriguez recently sizzled at their second Met Gala as a couple.
