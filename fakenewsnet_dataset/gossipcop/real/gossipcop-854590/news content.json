Bear is our world and we ask that you respect his privacy as we navigate our way through this together.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Cheryl, 35, posted a similar announcement on Twitter.\n\nPayne and Cheryl\u2019s romance owes its origins to the X Factor U.K. The pair first met while Cheryl was a judge on the show, and Payne a contestant, in 2008. The \u201cStrip That Down\u201d singer was paired with Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik on the reality competition series to create former boy band One Direction.\n\nNews that Payne and the former Girls Aloud member were expecting their first child was confirmed by PEOPLE in November 2016, with Cheryl officially announcing her pregnancy in February 2017.\n\nThe same month that Bear arrived, Payne opened up about his lady love for the first time.\n\n\u201cShe is a wonderful, wonderful person and it\u2019s amazing to have someone who can relate to so much of things \u2014 someone who\u2019s taken greater steps than me,\u201d Payne told U.K.\u2019s Rollacoaster magazine of Cheryl.\n\nHe added, \u201cShe\u2019s been my dream girl since I was younger. She\u2019s so ace.\u201d\n\nHewitt/SilverHub/Startraks\n\nLiam Payne and Cheryl\n\nIn an interview with The Sun in May 2017, Payne seemed to insinuate that the couple had no plans to wed, telling the outlet, \u201cI see marriage as more of a religious thing and I\u2019m not really a religious person.\u201d\n\nHe further told The Sun, \u201cWe have a baby together \u2014 you know, our love for each other can\u2019t be more serious, so it is what it is I guess.\u201d\n\nAs breakup speculation amped up earlier this year, it appeared the duo still supported each other. After Cheryl posted a photo of herself posing with a sign for the Prince\u2019s Trust \u201cYouth Can Do It\u201d campaign on Feb. 20, Payne commented, \u201cVery proud of you! How you find the time to do this [I\u2019ll] never know.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cOver many years you\u2019ve put all this together and put your heart into such a great cause! I hope one day I can do the same.\u201d\n\nIn March, Payne shut down rumors that the relationship was on the rocks, but admitted to ES Magazine that the couple faced \u201cstruggles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe funniest thing was a week before we were getting married. The next week we\u2019re splitting up,\u201d he said of reports that the pair were putting on a \u201cloved-up display\u201d at the 2018 BRIT Awards in February.\n\nMatt Baron/REX/Shutterstock\n\nCheryl and Liam Payne\n\n\u201cAnd the thing for me is, I just like to think we\u2019re somewhere in the middle. You know, we have our struggles \u2014 like of course I\u2019m not gonna sit here and say that everything\u2019s absolutely fine and dandy, because of course you go through different things, and that\u2019s what a relationship is,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut we go through them together as a family and that\u2019s the most important thing for me.\u201d\n\nPayne said he wasn\u2019t threatened by a rough patch in his relationship, arguing, \u201ctell me a relationship in the world that doesn\u2019t go through a spot like that?\u201d\n\nMike Marsland/WireImage\n\nCheryl and Liam Payne\n\nCheryl previously addressed gossip that they put on an act for the cameras during their recent appearance together on Twitter.\n\n\u201cYour \u2018stunt\u2019 theories are just ludicrous and a bit weird,\u201d she said in February.\n\nCheryl was previously married to Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini for 19 months. Payne split up with longtime girlfriend Sophia Smith in October 2015.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/iVVVtZEzpOBor-PNrKOPn-TAbYo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x479:1001x481)/lana-del-rey-1-72c42843e4644ffc8e25af0271966bf7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/dN0KowtuA1Wo6QldVoDmb6CFkxg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x359:706x361)/em-rata-10123-0c860b1126f04562af3eed599d6e8f32.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/XEhLpONbbN6vJBEcD0UYgmD5Buw=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/299205911_10221228251043561_3802947305789546517_n-6308b9dca19248448d77186d46cd19c9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/PjwLl_xv8DuFC6L9XEKyX7m4grc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x494:961x496)/liam-payne-1dfcb40b06b44e71b38e76d21f0ef682.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/DMzF_zmnH0R6hhHDWaLKvT9agIY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(686x0:688x2)/liam-payne-1-1-2000-5997b21f71b04f908a60e0c30402603c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/dofUIX9kS-l0I86LAEoH2reHFuw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/louis-tomlinson-liam-payne-031723-1-f226541be0ae429385733dc423cf1ac0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3QyR5_V6oLpq9An6-bc84ZUEfCU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x494:981x496)/madonna-5f7328b842d74e379f0b4ae584c01fc3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/6BLLG5Qn_YTOy1pYclvU4KtfTUY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x614:981x616)/tiger-woods-elin-erica-split-84f045240cdb45218a7d20c0ab515e69.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/mXF7WS5rk3xTDw-8h3FO4aOtdQ0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x569:1021x571)/shakira-gerard-pique-1-4d71ef8091cf4e86ab45b1b4fbe79015.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/aHoatYPuJRQCMtqHdmttTDi5fPg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x249:676x251)/Phoebe-Dynevor-Pete-Davidson-1-2c80f3195ccf495c977a7c5307acb0b8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/DTYLokgjA1OLhUBbOlGxWI2F3r0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/liam-payne-4-2000-3e9555cf330d4cccbc40af324be96b95.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/st4OuBsEHJAIcWlyKeT29O1EC6k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x349:721x351)/zayn-malik-grammys-032423-7ed19864859f40caa61ec08458090a14.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/aEK2S8hcAzjn5USwTZq39E6epwA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/common-dating-history-031423-8601a2e91a584b1a8372f2c08213be88.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jfIiDghRFU5E-_4qyWl8IiNWZAc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x252:1021x254)/shawn-mendes-031523-578f51eab6c64391987d5c8f75daa60a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/CmpYJbK9R2LKv276_6v9btL1kmU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(784x0:786x2)/cheryl-cole-1-bd47384a67d34c16b1e1765710ba1d2c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/PROz7pfJZjxSgAqC7ywl85qxZI0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x252:1001x254)/Matthew-Lawrence-and-Cheryl-Burke-030723-e49ebb1edaee44caae5e7610a0646d60.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZtnVVL2n2gFX8W7U7H0kWG8Gf1A=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1039x449:1041x451)/avril-lavigne-dating-history-tout-1-694023b5a74c4269b352b847b15147e9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8cJmVZc7Ok6w5_4Wwxc14qmMsU4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_generic-1885945d8bd544778fbbf4be88a63f00.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1pYNjVPMA_12WgXvg9MjM1k9CA0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(496x379:498x381)/Selena-Gomez-and-Hailey-Bieber-101622-02-2000-53669c9a2cb54f04a8ba0fd2cd45481f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/bolGpFwIeN4NKKGMYtbHJQt7Qy8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/louis-tomlinson-all-of-those-voices-uk-premiere-032223-1-868fef35477f44528f895d4dc8364540.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/DTYLokgjA1OLhUBbOlGxWI2F3r0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/liam-payne-4-2000-3e9555cf330d4cccbc40af324be96b95.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Kimble", "Lindsay Kimble Is The Director Of Newsroom Operations At People.
