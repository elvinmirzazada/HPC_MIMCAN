At the Coach show (she\u2019s an ambassador for the brand), the actress and singer sported a set of long, wispy, Brigitte Bardot-inspired bangs and what looks like some extensions to lengthen her ends. She teamed her new hair with a floral handkerchief hem dress, leather jacket and lace-up boots from the label.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty\n\nAlthough Gomez has been spotted out in L.A. since news broke that she\u2019d be seeking treatment for her ongoing battle with anxiety and depression, this is the 25-year-old\u2019s first time attending an event.\n\nLooking for more style content?

She wants to go again later this year. She feels and looks great. She\u2019s still working on new music and is excited about it.\u201d\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: UPDATED!
