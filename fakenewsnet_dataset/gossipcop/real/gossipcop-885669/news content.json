{"url": "https://people.com/style/ariana-grande-beauty-evolution/", "text": "01 of 15 2008 Jim Spellman/WireImage Who's that girl? A 15-year-old Grande first stepped into the spotlight with dark brown, naturally curly hair -- a look she seemingly hasn't sported in public since this photo was taken. But what has stayed the same is her love of black eyeliner, which she'd continue to wear on the regular.\n\n02 of 15 2009 Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic Soon after her debut, Grande was already making major beauty moves. Her eyeliner evolved from her waterline to a sleek cat eye, and her brown ringlets transformed into a straight red lob for her role as Cat on Nickelodeon's Victorious.\n\n03 of 15 2010 Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage Grande's bright red hair kept getting longer -- and, it turns out, more damaged. The star shared that the constant coloring of her strands changed her hair for good. \"I had to bleach my hair and dye it red every other week for the first 4 years of playing Cat... as one would assume, that completely destroyed my hair. I now wear a wig on Sam & Cat,\" she wrote in a 2014 Facebook post.\n\n04 of 15 2011 Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic Eventually, she discovered what would become her all-time favorite hairstyle: the ponytail, which hid damage and made her feel confident. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a thousand different ways to do a ponytail,\" she said in a 2016 interview with Byrdie. \"A million!\u2026It brings me so much joy, honestly. Every time I put my hair up, it\u2019s like a surprise.\u201d\n\n05 of 15 2012 Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty Next came her second-most-worn style in her arsenal, the half-up ponytail. Here, she wore her strands parted to the side with loose curls, which she paired with a berry lip.\n\n06 of 15 2012 Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic When Grande's hair became too damaged from dying it red, she dyed it back to brown and began wearing a red wig to film her Nickelodeon shows. \"My real hair is back to brown and I wear extensions,\" Grande said on Facebook. \"But I wear it in a ponytail because my actual hair is so broken that it looks absolutely ratchet and absurd when I let it down.\"\n\n07 of 15 2013 Jason Merritt/Getty Images This year brought her lightest hair color yet, a golden blonde hue (the half-up hair was here to stay, however).\n\n08 of 15 2014 Frazer Harrison/Getty Images We hardly recognize Grande with her hair down! The star briefly broke up with her ponytail, but the split didn't last very long.\n\n09 of 15 2014 Mindy Small/FilmMagic She quickly returned to her old half-up ways, this time introducing a cat-ear headband, which would eventually become a staple in her wardrobe.\n\n10 of 15 2015 Lester Cohen/WireImage No matter how much she wears a half-up hairstyle, Grande has proved her devotion to the full ponytail time and time again. And at the 2015 Grammys, she did so with a darker shade of brown.\n\n11 of 15 2016 Jason Merritt/Getty A year later, she strayed away from her go-to cat eye, opting for a deep black smoky look and her usual nude lip.\n\n12 of 15 2016 Allen Berezovsky/Getty As the star herself said, every ponytail has the potential to be different. She proved this philosophy at the American Music Awards, where she went for a butt-grazing pony perched at the top of her head \u2014 her longest length ever, thanks to extensions.\n\n13 of 15 2016 Jamie McCarthy/Getty The ponytail remained, but the color changed. Grande debuted lighter tips at the MTV VMAs, continuing her hair's \"evolution.\" \u201cThe pony has also gone through an evolution, and I\u2019m proud of that,\u201d Grande, 24, said in her 2018 Fader cover story. \u201cOld pony? I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s that girl. But new pony? I like her. I mean, it\u2019s like a Victoria Secret angel without angel wings. It\u2019s still her without them, but when she\u2019s with them it\u2019s like, Ohh, I get it, she\u2019s an angel.\u201d\n\n14 of 15 2018 Kevin Mazur/Getty Alas, her lightest color ever. Grande bleached her hair a bright platinum shade, which she wore sans ponytail and paired with uncharacteristically minimal makeup on the covers of Elle and British Vogue.", "images":
