{"url": "https://www.self.com/story/brie-bella-milk-production-breastfeeding", "text": "Brie Bella, WWE wrestler and star of both Total Divas and Total Bellas, shared last year that she produced more breast milk than she needed after having her daughter, Birdie\u2014so much so, that she donated her extra milk to help babies at her local hospital. But now, Bella revealed that she eventually struggled to produce as much milk as she used to.\n\n\u201cMy breast milk\u2019s taken a huge dip,\u201d she said at a breastfeeding support group, as seen in a sneak peek from Wednesday\u2019s episode of Total Divas.\n\n\u201cI used to have enough where I donate. And now I\u2019ve realized in the last month that I can\u2019t even keep up with her during the day so I\u2019ve had to introduce one bottle of formula a day,\" she continued. \"I\u2019m trying to pump and do all this stuff, but it\u2019s the stress\u2014I hate pumping, to the point it makes me feel bad when I\u2019m doing it because I\u2019m so miserable.\u201d\n\nBella also said in the clip that she struggled with \u201cmom guilt\u201d over her milk production, adding that it\u2019s \u201cthe worst feeling in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought pumping could balance Birdie and my job but it\u2019s not working,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird how you just constantly feel like you\u2019re failing.\u201d\n\nYour breast milk usually works on a \"supply and demand\" schedule. So if there's less demand, the supply will go down as well.\n\nFor instance, \"if the baby starts sleeping through the night or if mom is back to work and not breastfeeding or pumping as much as she was, milk supply can drop,\" Diane L. Spatz, Ph.D., a professor of perinatal nursing at the University of Pennsylvania and nurse researcher at The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, tells SELF.\n\nOr, \u201cif the baby drinks less milk, or formula is introduced instead of breast milk, the supply can dwindle,\u201d Joan Younger Meek, M.D., R.D., chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding and associate dean for Graduate Medical Education at Florida State University College of Medicine, tells SELF.\n\nCertain medications, like hormonal birth control, can also affect your milk supply, as can fatigue or stress, Joanne Goldbort, Ph.D., R.N., a breastfeeding researcher and assistant professor in the College of Nursing at Michigan State University, tells SELF. And if you get your period when you're nursing, you may also see a drop in your milk supply during that time, Spatz says.", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/654d0657899bfa063ef8275a/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/654e6f0b8f31fcccb2b39505/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/653abb8ed09bbeb5796b4961/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/653fcf83e43f6329ccc4a12a/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/65661078c71c253cf3f8ed57/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/654185665c8b3e46b57a9684/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/656641b2de473ca8fe56c5de/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5b881cac9134316166c7782c/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/654bbcf4f394cde6d8a6906c/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Korin Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/brie-bella-milk-production-breastfeeding", "title": "'Total Divas' Star Brie Bella's Milk Production Took 'a Huge Dip' While Breastfeeding Her Daughter", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "WWE wrestler and \"Total Divas\" star Brie Bella explained in an upcoming episode that her milk supply dropped, which gave her \"mom guilt.\"", "id": "5bbce5473f15b979ec036a5c", "keywords": "breastfeeding,news", "news_keywords": "breastfeeding,news", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5bbce5473f15b979ec036a5c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"WWE wrestler and \\\"Total Divas\\\" star Brie Bella explained in an upcoming episode that her milk supply dropped, which gave her \\\"mom guilt.\\\"\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The experience gave her \"mom guilt.\"", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "'Total Divas' Star Brie Bella's Milk Production Took 'a Huge Dip' While Breastfeeding Her Daughter", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/brie-bella-milk-production-breastfeeding"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-10-09T22:45:28.089Z", "modified_time": "2018-10-09T22:45:28.089Z", "author": "Korin Miller"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "The experience gave her \"mom guilt.\"", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@SELFmagazine", "title": "'Total Divas' Star Brie Bella's Milk Production Took 'a Huge Dip' While Breastfeeding Her Daughter"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169640983205651, "pages": 8908243810}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1539125128.089, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
