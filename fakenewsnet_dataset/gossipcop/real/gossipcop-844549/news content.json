I also have a fat wallet & will no longer be using your services. Ever,\u201d she continued. \u201c#putmymoneywheremymouthis.\u201d\n\nWhen reached for comment, an Uber spokesperson told PEOPLE: \u201cWe expect all riders and drivers to treat each other with respect as laid out in our Community Guidelines.\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Real Cost of Going to Coachella\n\nLater, Holliday added to the caption \u2014 defending her use of the word \u201cfat\u201d to label her driver.\n\n\u201cSaying my driver is fat was obviously being used as a descriptor & not to insult him,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAlso I did not show his face or use his name when filming, it was to be able to show what I deal with daily & why this behavior is unacceptable from anyone.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Tess Holliday Has a Message for Her Haters!\n\nHolliday recently talked about how she\u2019s had trouble accepting her post-baby body.\n\n\u201cEach day feels like a battle to learn how to love my body postpartum,\u201d Holliday shared alongside photos of herself in a bra and underwear. \u201cIt\u2019s been six months, and my stomach is lower, my breasts are a different shape, [I have] new stretch marks, and I feel like a stranger in my body more than ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t anticipating this at all,\u201d she writes. \u201cI\u2019m not used to looking in the mirror and feeling like I don\u2019t recognize myself, but sadly that\u2019s my reality some days.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/christina-el-moussa.jpg?crop=156px%2C12px%2C1224px%2C818px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/tess-holliday-2000.jpg?w=1131&h=2000", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/irina-shayk1.jpg?crop=459px%2C311px%2C1071px%2C717px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/tess-holliday-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1131px%2C848.25px&resize=660%2C495&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/lesley-murphy.jpg?crop=0px%2C191px%2C2000px%2C1339px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/dirty-dancing-havana-nights.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C802.85714285714px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kim-kardashian4.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C1500px%2C1004px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kelly-diane-howland.jpg?crop=0px%2C186px%2C2000px%2C1337px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://people.com/bodies/tess-holliday-uber-boycott-body-shame/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/julia-wmb-cover.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C945px%2C632.25px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/richard-simmons.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C480px%2C321.14285714286px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/richard-simmons-31.jpg?crop=162px%2C20px%2C1706px%2C1142px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/tess-holliday-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1131px%2C848.25px&resize=660%2C495&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170420041312/http://people.com/bodies/tess-holliday-uber-boycott-body-shame/", "title": "Tess Holliday Boycotts Uber After Driver Body-Shames Her: \u2018I\u2019m Fat But I Also Have a Fat Wallet\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1143086910", "description": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BTC5CtgB9hY/?hl=en Model\u00a0Tess Holliday\u00a0is boycotting Uber after one if its drivers allegedly body-shamed her.
