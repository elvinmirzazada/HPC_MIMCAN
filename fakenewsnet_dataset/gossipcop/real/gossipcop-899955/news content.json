I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m finally getting to tell this story.\u201d\n\nStamos, 55, said he was taken into a private room and offered materials.\n\n\u201cI went into this little room and they said, \u2018If you need any stimulation or whatever, there\u2019s videos and there\u2019s a TV here,\u2019 \u201d he recalled. \u201cSo I turn the TV on \u2014 and it\u2019s on Fuller House. My hand to God!\u201d\n\n\u201cI go, \u2018If I\u2019m going to masturbate to myself, it\u2019s going to be my old self \u2014 not the new one!\u2019 \u201d he quipped as Philipps, 39, burst out laughing.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: New Dad John Stamos Opens Up About Fatherhood & Reveals Which Parent His Son Looks Like\n\nThe actor revealed that he and his then-fianc\u00e9e McHugh were expecting exclusively to PEOPLE in December 2017, explaining that the couple had \u201ctalked about\u201d having a baby in the past \u2014 and everything just fell into place.\n\n\u201cWe have the same morals and the same values, that all clicked nicely. So we said, \u2018Oh, well, maybe we should have a family,\u2019 \u201d Stamos said.\n\nMcHugh suggested, \u201d \u2018Maybe we should have a kid [before we get married]\u2019 and I said, \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018 he continued, revealing his fianc\u00e9e jokingly responded, \u201cBecause you\u2019re old.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe [pregnancy] happened. Then I said, I better have a ring on her finger, because it\u2019s the right thing to do, and I wanted to marry her anyway,\u201d Stamos added.\n\nAccording to McHugh, the look on Stamos\u2019 face when he found out she was pregnant was \u201cpriceless.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the look of a man who has wanted a family of his own but wasn\u2019t sure it was going to happen for him,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it is!\u201d\n\nBusy Tonight airs Sunday through Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET on E!, Fuller House season 4 hits Netflix on Dec. 14.", "images":
