One of the questions was whether or not Jimmy had appeared on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" while donning an Olympic figure skater costume. \"That sounds like he would for sure do that,\" Ellen said.\n\nShe was wrong though, as Jimmy didn't do that in the past. Instead, the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" host dressed as Olympic figure skater in that episode. After much struggles, Jimmy managed to sit down and said, \"I am so happy to be here and so honored to be a part of your 50th...50th birthday?\" to which Ellen replied, \"60th.\"\n\n\"You've been so generous to everyone, all your audience, to all of us, to me, personally,\" Jimmy continued. \"I have something for you,\" he added, before putting his hand inside his outfit and pulling out a banana from his crotch.\n\n\"So important. Bone density is really something you have to look out for,\" Jimmy told Ellen who was laughing.\n\nIn addition to Jimmy, Ellen got the \"best\" birthday present from her wife Portia de Rossi which made her burst into tears. \"So, for your birthday, Ellen, I am bringing you and your hero, Dian, together by building The Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund,\" Porita said in a video in which she talked about Ellen's hero. \"Ellen, you will carry on Dian's legacy by giving them a permanent home in Rwanda. Now, you will join Dian as a protector and champion of these amazing animals, the mountain gorillas. Happy birthday!\"\n\nThe birthday gift was not stopping there as Portia continued, \"I have also set up a foundation in your name called The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund. So, this is the first initiative for the fund that you can take this and do whatever you want with it. You've done amazing work for elephants and you can just continue and support whatever you want to do.\"\n\nYou can share this post!", "images": ["https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/jimmy-kimmel-has-ellen-degeneres-60th-birthday-gift-on-his-crotch.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2023/01/26/00199619.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x400/2023/11/28/00215716.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/28/00215726.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/11/29/00215804.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2022/12/15/00197331.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/28/00215706.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2022/05/27/00186751.jpg", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/29/00215771.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/11/29/00215797.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/11/29/00215796e1.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/29/00215774.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/11/29/00215799.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/29/00215784.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/119x83/2023/11/29/00215759.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/11/29/00215803.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/assets/img/logo.png", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/300x188/2023/11/29/00215795.webp", "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/display/images/90x60/2023/01/28/00199750.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/jimmy-kimmel-has-ellen-degeneres-60th-birthday-gift-on-his-crotch.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aceshowbiz Team"], "canonical_link": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00117223.html", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Has Ellen DeGeneres' 60th Birthday Gift on His Crotch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The 'Ellen DeGeneres Show' host also bursts into tears after receiving the 'best' birthday gift from her wife Portia de Rossi.", "author": "AceShowbiz Team", "fb": {"app_id": 320088948016615}, "og": {"title": "Jimmy Kimmel Has Ellen DeGeneres' 60th Birthday Gift on His Crotch", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00117223.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/jimmy-kimmel-has-ellen-degeneres-60th-birthday-gift-on-his-crotch.jpg", "alt": "Jimmy Kimmel Has Ellen DeGeneres' 60th Birthday Gift on His Crotch"}, "site_name": "AceShowbiz", "description": "The 'Ellen DeGeneres Show' host also bursts into tears after receiving the 'best' birthday gift from her wife Portia de Rossi."}, "twitter": {"title": "Jimmy Kimmel Has Ellen DeGeneres' 60th Birthday Gift on His Crotch", "description": "The 'Ellen DeGeneres Show' host also bursts into tears after receiving the 'best' birthday gift from her wife Portia de Rossi.", "image": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/news/jimmy-kimmel-has-ellen-degeneres-60th-birthday-gift-on-his-crotch.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@aceshowbiz", "creator": "@aceshowbiz", "domain": "aceshowbiz.com"}, "googlebot-news": "index,follow", "googlebot": "index,follow", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "language": "en", "geo.country": "US", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "theme-color": "#5F256F", "facebook-domain-verification": "w1cnp2fiw07juij7ioh13nr1t76oqf"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/XmtlKfssi2M", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/XrTDwpLECtA"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.aceshowbiz.com", "summary": ""}
