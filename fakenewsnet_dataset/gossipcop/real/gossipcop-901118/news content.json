Everyone has a story.\u201d\n\nDave Allocca/Starpix/REX/Shutterstock\n\nSo what\u2019s the Australian actress\u2019 story?\n\n\u201cI once found \u2014 and no one guessed that this was me \u2014 I found a human foot on the beach in Nicaragua,\u201d she said much to the surprise of the others, later adding, \u201cJust a little souvenir.\u201d\n\nRobbie visited Nicaragua in 2014.\n\n\u201cOh, wow, death!\u201d said Spencer, 47, while Kruger, 41, responded: \u201cJust the bones?\u201d Cranston, 61, added some humor by joking, \u201cAnd she uses it as a doorstop.\u201d\n\nOddly, finding a severed food is not as unusual as it sounds, with more than a dozen detached human feet washing up on beaches in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington state in the last decade.\n\nThe latest of the mysterious floating feet washed ashore near the Jordan River on Vancouver Island earlier this month, according to the New York Times. This time a dog found a left foot along with an attached tibia and fibula which was still wearing a white sock and black running shoe.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115834im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/margot-robbie-00.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115834im_/http://people.com/img/sign-up-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115834im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/margot-robbie-00.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115834im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115834im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/article-covers/3313_106804645_2016_05_02_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115834im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115834im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/margot-robbie-00.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115834/http://people.com/movies/margot-robbie-found-severed-human-foot-on-nicaragua-beach/", "title": "Margot Robbie Recalls Finding Severed Human Foot on Beach", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "margot robbie, i, tonya, severed foot, the hollywood reporter, thr roundtable", "news_keywords": "margot robbie, i, tonya, severed foot, the hollywood reporter, thr roundtable", "description": "Margot Robbie\u00a0once found a severed human foot at a beach \u2013 no big deal.
