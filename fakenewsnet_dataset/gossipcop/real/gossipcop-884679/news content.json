This isn\u2019t the first time the two have made fans wonder about their relationship; the IRL Nancy and Jonathan, who had crushes on each other in the show, have been rumored to be dating since early 2017, but still haven\u2019t confirmed it.\n\nOver the weekend, photographers snapped Charlie and Natalia holding hands on a leisurely stroll together in Paris. They shared a pair of earbuds and were also spotted with Charlie\u2019s arm comfortably around Natalia\u2019s shoulders. A cozy autumn walk around Paris is looking pretty good right now.\n\nHolding hands obviously does not equal relationship, but fans are still thrilled about a possible pairing between the two stars.\n\nX content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/65550be21ea5e88ee16a9de1/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a01dfdea61c46262fc68aba/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/E005_C001_0117JE_001.025810.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6536d44046fe26d69a0f2d5c/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a01f1c904c1421ac8c7d1d0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6543b5a44ad6e92cdbd14d1e/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/65550546c2847afa29b86602/1:1/pass/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a01f1c904c1421ac8c7d1d0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Kara K.
