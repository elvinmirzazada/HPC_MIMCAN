The clause can be added to contracts for actors and others working on a movie, requiring that the movie\u2019s producers hire a diverse cast and crew. If the movie wasn\u2019t diverse, it would give the actor a legal reason to back out of the contract \u2014 meaning the rider could have a serious effect on all the hiring practices on a film.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Cord-Jefferson-.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JodieFosterOscars.jpg?fit=618%2C412&ssl=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JodieFosterOscars.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1499337779.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/past-lives-a24.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CMS-Asteroid-City.jpg?resize=320%2C180&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/race-begins-scaled.jpg?fit=250%2C300&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JodieFosterOscars.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Steve Pond", "Mike Roe", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/jodie-foster-actual-reason-crutches-oscars-and-it-wasnt-meryls-fault/", "title": "Jodie Foster's Oscar-Night Crutches Explained", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jodie Foster's Oscar-Night Crutches Explained - No, It Wasn't Meryl's Fault - TheWrap", "description": "On Sunday night, Foster joked she was on crutches because Streep \"I, Tonya'ed\" her", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/jodie-foster-actual-reason-crutches-oscars-and-it-wasnt-meryls-fault/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JodieFosterOscars.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-03-05T15:46:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-05T16:05:48+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "site": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.2.3", "parsely-title": "Jodie Foster\u2019s Oscar-Night Crutches Explained \u2013 No, It Wasn\u2019t Meryl\u2019s Fault", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/jodie-foster-actual-reason-crutches-oscars-and-it-wasnt-meryls-fault/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-03-05T07:46:13-08:00", "parsely-section": "awards", "parsely-author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "parsely-tags": "academy_awards, casey_affleck, frances_mcdormand, jennifer_lawrence, jodie_foster, meryl_streep, oscars", "article-tags": "academy_awards, casey_affleck, frances_mcdormand, jennifer_lawrence, jodie_foster, meryl_streep, oscars}", "article-section": "awards", "article-categories": "awards", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/thewrap-site-icon-1.png?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520264773.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
