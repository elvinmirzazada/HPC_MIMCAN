It's the first time I've been back since Bobby died. I didn't expect to be emotional when I walked in the door. He would have been 72 two weeks ago... it's surreal. But he's here.\u201d\n\nDoes she still have a relationship with Bobby's family?\u201cPeople want to know, I still have a relationship with Bobby's family. I love his kids, I love his family. I promised him I would take care, especially his daughter, Jennifer.\u201d\n\nWas she surprised her \u201cfrenemy\u201d Bethenny Frankel attended Bobby's funeral?\u201cI didn't expect her there. I hoped she'd come. In a sad way, Bobby would have liked to have seen us make up. But I think that his death, in a weird way, he knew that would bring us back somehow together. At least to make peace with each other, which was great.\u201d\n\nHow did she react when she saw her at Bobby's funeral?\"We embraced. She was crying and she said she didn't expect to cry, but the service was too overwhelming for her.\"\n\nDid she know \"The Real Housewives of New York\" production would be filming outside her husband's funeral?\u201cThe show had asked me if they could cover it in some way, because they wanted to make a memorial for Bobby during the season\u2026 I said, 'If that's what you want to do, I would be honored.'\u201d", "images": ["https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/ae/4by3/2023/11/22/aea06554dd094d1fa8e90c45f0b65cab_sm.jpg",
