{"url": "https://www.self.com/story/gina-rodriguez-february-2018", "text": "Five months ago, Rodriguez started working with \u201ca great new nutritionist,\u201d who identified a bunch of common foods that were getting in the way of her health. When she stays away from them, she says, \u201cso many of my ailments are gone. It feels like freedom. This is new. I'm 33. It's taken me a while.\"\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m on point, always on it, because, man, I\u2019m flawed.\u201d\n\nShe qualifies: \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m on point, always on it, because, man, I\u2019m flawed.\u201d A raft of most-craved foods rolls off her tongue with ease. \u201cI want the burger and the ice cream and the red velvet cupcakes. I want the croissant with my coffee, even though gluten doesn\u2019t do me justice.\u201d But it helps to remember it\u2019s all about baby steps, about making healthy living a daily, or even hourly, decision. \u201cWhen you say, just today, I\u2019m going to choose this because I know it\u2019s going to make me feel better, that\u2019s not such a crazy Mount Everest.\u201d\n\nHer boyfriend of one and a half years, Joe LoCicero, has been a cornerstone of the network of friends and family supporting her as she navigates the choppy waters of chronic illness. An actor and martial artist who practices Muay Thai (Thai boxing), LoCicero traveled to Thailand with Rodriguez in late 2016 so they could train in the sport together.\n\n\u201c[He] has really helped me have a healthier perspective on [weight], that stupid number that can destroy us and feel like it\u2019s equivalent to our self-worth,\u201d she says. \u201cThis love is so easy,\u201d she adds, describing her relationship with LoCicero as one of \u201crespect and kindness, and generosity, and compromise, and sacrifice.\u201d\n\nIt bothers her that another symptom of Hashimoto's\u2014memory troubles\u2014can make it seem like she doesn't always appreciate the little details that make their relationship so great. While she says that her forgetfulness hasn't interfered with memorizing lines, an important part of her job, \"I can't remember maybe a sweet thing my boyfriend has said to me a week ago. Or what we ate yesterday,\" she laments. \"It makes me feel shame. I don't want him to think that I'm not remembering our special moments together. And that stinks.\"\n\nRodriguez rose to fame in 2014 on Jane the Virgin (where she and LoCicero met). The show introduced enthusiastic swaths of America to the delicious drama of Latin American soap operas known as telenovelas. It has everything: murder, romance, and Jane\u2019s accidental artificial insemination as a virgin, to boot. After its first season, the series won a People\u2019s Choice Award and a Peabody, and Rodriguez took home a Golden Globe for best actress in a TV comedy or musical.", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/5a7dfbbea2e4610403db1d80/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gina_Rodriguez_2.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a7dfbbde1c59b0841326f99/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gina_Rodriguez_1.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/653abb8ed09bbeb5796b4961/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a7dfbc3a2e4610403db1d84/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gina_Rodriguez_4.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/65661078c71c253cf3f8ed57/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/653fbcf64991ce915398cab5/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ed8128f0c60d44a5699bea6/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6543f0dc16d1566ed34ff402/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/61f2b0cd898b9838f51324f7/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6557dafaa76d764356679808/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/6543f7f3576c8f715932c03c/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a7dfbc5a2e4610403db1d86/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gina_Rodriguez_6.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/653ff7f9673a3159f9e2dd68/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a85e2bee1c59b0841327607/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/gina-rodriguez-alexander-wang.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/656641b2de473ca8fe56c5de/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a85e2bee1c59b0841327607/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/gina-rodriguez-alexander-wang.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/65662a25de473ca8fe56c5dc/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6542c2406277e8152d0dd807/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5a85e2bee1c59b0841327607/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/gina-rodriguez-alexander-wang.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Zahra Barnes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/gina-rodriguez-february-2018", "title": "Gina Rodriguez on Hashimoto's, Equal Pay, and Learning to Fight For Herself", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Actor and director Gina Rodriguez is taking on Hollywood, and dealing with Hashimoto's disease.
