I also understand that the instant plea to the aggravated misdemeanor will resolve any and all criminal matters, investigations, etc. arising from the accident on April 24, 2017 and no further prosecution or charges will be brought against me. \u2026 I understand the court may accept or reject the agreement or defer its decision as to acceptance or rejection until receipt of a PSI.\u201d\n\nHis sentencing is set for Jan. 8 at 1:30 p.m.\n\nOn April 25, 2017, Soules was arrested and charged with leaving the scene of a car accident that resulted in the death of 66-year-old Vietnam veteran Kenneth E. Mosher.\n\nGeilenfeld Funeral Home\n\nHe was arrested in Iowa after he allegedly crashed his truck into a tractor, running it off the road into a ditch. His vehicle was later found at a home that he was present at, and Soules allegedly refused to leave until officers obtained a search warrant several hours later.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Andi Dorfman on Former \u2018Bachelor\u2019 Star Chris Soules After Deadly Car Crash: \u2018He\u2019s Hanging in There\u2019\n\nIn his written conditional guilty plea, Soules detailed the crash and admitted his wrongdoing to not providing his vehicle\u2019s registration number to police.\n\n\u201cBy way of factual basis, I hereby state that on or about April 24, 2017 in Buchanan County, Iowa, I was driving a vehicle that was involved in an accident resulting in serious injury to another person. I knew the accident occurred and knew it resulted in an injury to another person,\u201d wrote Soules. \u201cThough I immediately stopped, called 911 and identified myself, and rendered reasonable aid to the injured person \u2014 including requesting an ambulance and administering CPR while the ambulance was en route \u2014 I acknowledge I did not provide the registration number of the vehicle I was driving to 911 dispatch or law enforcement as required by Iowa Code 321.263.\u201d\n\nIowa State Patrol alleged that he fled the scene, violating the Iowa code that states: \u201cIf the accident causes the death of a person, all surviving drivers shall remain at the scene of the accident except to seek necessary aid or to report the accident to law enforcement authorities.\u201d\n\nAfter entering a not guilty plea in May 2017 to the charge, Soules\u2019 legal team filed a motion to dismiss the \u201cfailure to remain\u201d charge on constitutional grounds, refuting the last sentence of the Iowa state code.\n\nThe attorneys said in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that \u201cbecause Mr. Soules indisputably stopped his vehicle, returned to the injured driver, contacted law enforcement, provided aid to the injured driver, arranged for medical treatment for the injured driver, remained until emergency personnel responded to the injured party, and provided identification data, the State\u2019s charge must be dismissed.\u201d\n\nTheir request to dismiss was denied in January before being brought to the Iowa Supreme Court. In February, multiple outlets reported that an Iowa Supreme Court denied an appeal.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/znXAX7Ai0u16WCavKwXjbQsa6pg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x608:961x610)/alec-baldwin-1-011923-74b41f8671874468a28e7ca8924d905b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/geYE6XWFUd44o3aIfa11gaO5jTo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/chris-soules-2000-1-1c759858e3284871a7f697288d842a75.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/uQcVqq9cfD6KH8-kul5q_3VGbes=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x0:961x2)/chrisley_wp-1-957d1105bcbd4df6acbda60d7de35099.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hbfpW-oC_83TSOKdJVIGK0dlM6Y=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/angelo-colon-ortiz-6aee78e8086a4a6abf1343e6fe5bf5b4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/izzAwXRfEwKwinuSP2ytQBJ1Bfg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x479:751x481)/katie-layne-quackenbush-110722-0bbced314b9f44ae82d42d993319eaa9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/r1nfKp4gr03-1lpgdUregiVBbRw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/ezra-miller-controversy-timeline-061323-tout-efd37266930e4c9b868a917d4080e0a1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1dwtJiLx1vT2hPW3WwGiZCgO894=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x212:921x214)/Bryan-Kohberger-010323-2000-0db71987429c49f8b954c119bbdb8afc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/2ePGp9Xd3pV7D5bIgJ0xnDxm-fQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x9:766x11)/Golden-State-Killer-Victims-73744fa8688c46c48638ce2b213d00f1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/UmbToUl16j8OFPMg4QY4z8vFKjU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/paul-pelosi-1-81cd34ad386f47cea9e71b82b2b54b22.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/dPFfWeVl7bgN-RiimMy-ZG3BN4M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x431:721x433)/libbie-allan-0020c767acbc405da1007c67939aa012.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/J5G2gMBKqnIjRbaIf58ngKSoiD4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(939x252:941x254)/Jennifer-Shah-121722-01-2000-500f874d4f114cf9a949a75e460123ba.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ynhAAPlBB8gD-fbz3B8A9lVbh3Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/ronald-greene-121622-1-69444230bcfc4b69bfee0f93f05b195c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/wLn8VNmeC8tBaSpDktz1H06oT2Q=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(868x0:870x2)/kenny-mosher-2000-15816187713344b1b09f06da533f1c2d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/x5fOXYitrAQxa1-Nrhqp4q5Fct4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(648x239:650x241)/lisa-banes-978f5b1693b74b1eba61a6b2b94b4a33.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/VrW5IWqyafCs9h89aQFSG_6ujzk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(704x379:706x381)/Ramon-Najera-022723-c1342897fe044d6db68ccab1853f65e2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8I34LW1pTlVG457ukqTz8ngo0cc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/tyre-nichols20230127_60-d4876b6971ec404d9ab989c5231ad39d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2AWgsPmEaYQDSGxUHoy7AFmSLHg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/chris-soules-113ec11b9f6344588f68d28c37f05f81.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/vEfEIKHrdQ1UseHlLT-0IdCC8NM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x529:766x531)/Journee-Carroll-010623-bc00ff5e9a384116a589bb3a3ede5c60.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/TYNwK6KnD_r0GKW-APCt1_5e0Jg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x374:1001x376)/alexia-echevarria-kids-1-5ac5411f14ce4000adb0d8fdcc93e58b.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/2AWgsPmEaYQDSGxUHoy7AFmSLHg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/chris-soules-113ec11b9f6344588f68d28c37f05f81.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/chris-soules-enters-conditional-guilty-plea-car-crash/", "title": "The Bachelor's Chris Soules Enters Conditional Guilty Plea", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "On April 25, 2017, Chris Soules was arrested and charged with leaving the scene of a car accident that resulted in the death of 66-year-old Vietnam veteran Kenneth E.
