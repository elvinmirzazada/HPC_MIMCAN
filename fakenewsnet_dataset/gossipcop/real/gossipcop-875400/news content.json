The Wednesday telecast earned a 2.9 in the main demo and 14.7 million total viewers. All of those Nielsen numbers include a week of delayed viewing, and made Season 12 the most-watched \u201cAGT\u201d to-date.\n\nThe Tuesday episodes were the season\u2019s No. 1 show and the Wednesday ones were No. 2. Furthermore, \u201cAGT\u201d served as the lead-in to the third-biggest series of the summer, \u201cWorld of Dance.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d was created by Cowell and is co-produced by FremantleMedia North America and Syco Entertainment.
