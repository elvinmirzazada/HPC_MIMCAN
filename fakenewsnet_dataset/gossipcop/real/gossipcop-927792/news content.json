The model/bartender had been fired from SUR by Lisa Vanderpump \u2014 and also his relationship with Brittany Cartwright ended as well. Their breakup, a decision he made (or, as Shep Rose recently called it, the \"reverse projection\"), came after a pretty tumultuous season as Brittany grappled with Jax's infidelity. And this is how Brittany dealt with the split: \"I was trying to do my own thing, but he crept his way back into my heart again,\" she shared with E!'s Daily Pop this week about the aftermath of that split (clip above).\n\nHow to Watch Watch Vanderpump Rules on Peacock and the Bravo app.\n\nRelated\n\nSo, how did Jax win his longtime love back? \"He was very persistent and did not give up,\" Brittany explained to E! this week. \"There [were] some times, sorry to say this Jax, but I would have like 30 missed calls from him. He just wasn't going to give up on me. And I knew that I loved him still. I was trying to act like I didn't, but in the end, I'm just so glad that we are where we are now. We are so much better than we ever have been. I don't know, maybe we should have broke up sooner so that we could have gotten to this point sooner.\"\n\nAnother pivotal moment in their relationship and Jax's growth came as he was dealing with his dad's illness. His father died in December after battling cancer. Brittany added, \"That opened Jax's eyes as well.\"\n\nJax will open up more about losing his dad during the Vanderpump Rules reunion, which kicks off on Monday at 9/8c.
