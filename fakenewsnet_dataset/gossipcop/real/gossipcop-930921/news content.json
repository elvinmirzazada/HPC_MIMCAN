If anyone is going to end my career, okay, it\u2019s going to be me,\u201d he added. He then launched into a 10-minute segment in which he and his friends pick up his $150,000-plus custom Mercedes SUV.\n\nThe move comes after widespread criticism of Paul for his insensitivity and poor behavior in multiple incidents, including a vlog from late December where he filmed the body of an apparent suicide victim in a Japanese forest. During the same trip to Japan, Paul had earlier released vlogs where he \u201cwav[ed] raw fish in Japanese people\u2019s faces, dress[ed] up like Pikachu and [threw] a plush Pokeball at random people in the street, including a police officer.\u201d\n\nAlthough he later apologized, YouTube temporarily suspended ad revenue on his channels and put his YouTube Red projects on hold, citing a \u201crecent pattern of behavior.\u201d After taking several weeks away from vlogging to \u201creflect,\u201d Paul returned in late January with a video titled \u201cSuicide: Be Here Tomorrow,\u201d where he spoke with the director of the National Suicide Prevention Hotline and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to start a new chapter in my life.\u201d\n\nThis new chapter soon included jokes about swallowing Tide Pods and a vlog in which he pulled a koi fish out of a pond and pretended to give it CPR and tased a dead rat, indicating that he had learned very little. Once again, YouTube temporarily suspended ads on his channel.", "images": ["https://www.theverge.com/icons/native-ad-placeholder.png", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2950x1962/2400x2400/filters:focal(1241x557:1242x558):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25015564/BYSO_S1_UT_102_220503_PALBRO_00043RC_f_3000.jpeg", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3600x2397/2400x2400/filters:focal(1800x1199:1801x1200):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25016291/1175377257.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pk7JZzGd7Utk9-CXiMDsO7b-ef4=/0x118:3360x1994/1200x628/filters:focal(1344x301:1345x302)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10752423/Screen_Shot_2018_04_30_at_11.56.49_AM.png", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:4236x2824/2400x2400/filters:focal(2118x1412:2119x1413):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25014894/Image.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x2400/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23318439/akrales_220309_4977_0324.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pk7JZzGd7Utk9-CXiMDsO7b-ef4=/0x118:3360x1994/1200x628/filters:focal(1344x301:1345x302)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10752423/Screen_Shot_2018_04_30_at_11.56.49_AM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devon Maloney", "Laura Hudson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/30/17303330/logan-paul-daily-vlog-ending", "title": "YouTube star Logan Paul is ending his daily vlogs", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@verge"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "og": {"site_name": "The Verge", "title": "YouTube star Logan Paul is ending his daily vlogs", "description": "The YouTube star wants to \u201cdiversify, bro\u201d", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/30/17303330/logan-paul-daily-vlog-ending", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pk7JZzGd7Utk9-CXiMDsO7b-ef4=/0x118:3360x1994/1200x628/filters:focal(1344x301:1345x302)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10752423/Screen_Shot_2018_04_30_at_11.56.49_AM.png", "type": "image/png", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Verge", "google-site-verification": "IucFf_TKtbFFH8_YeFyEteQIwYPdANM1R46_U9DpAr4", "robots": "nocache", "description": "After a series of incidents where he was criticized for insensitivity and bad behavior, the popular vlogger is stepping back from regular content.", "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-30T19:15:19.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-30T19:15:19.000Z"}, "author": "Laura Hudson", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-title": "Logan Paul is ending his daily vlogs", "parsely-link": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/30/17303330/logan-paul-daily-vlog-ending", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pk7JZzGd7Utk9-CXiMDsO7b-ef4=/0x118:3360x1994/1200x628/filters:focal(1344x301:1345x302)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10752423/Screen_Shot_2018_04_30_at_11.56.49_AM.png", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-04-30T19:15:19.000Z", "parsely-section": "front-page", "parsely-tags": "verge,front-page,tech,youtube", "parsely-author": "Laura Hudson", "next-head-count": 34}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525035600.0, "source": "https://www.theverge.com", "summary": ""}
