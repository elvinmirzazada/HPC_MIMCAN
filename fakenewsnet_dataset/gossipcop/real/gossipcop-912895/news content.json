Now go home!\n\nAfter only nine days in the house \u2014 but only three nights on CBS \u2014 Big Brother\u2018s special celebrity edition evicted its first houseguest. But first, a spoiler! Don\u2019t read any further if you haven\u2019t watched the show.\n\nAt first it seemed as if James Maslow was the target of everyone\u2019s ire, but ultimately the majority of the house voted to boot Chuck Liddell. After saying his goodbyes to Julie Chen, we grabbed the mixed martial artist for a couple of burning questions.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What was your reaction when you heard your name?\n\nCHUCK LIDDELL: I was pretty sure I was gonna be gone. The day before everybody was saying I was fine. Today, they would look away every time I asked, \u2018Am I okay?\u2019 It was pretty easy to read that I was in trouble.\n\nDo you think you were more likable in the house than James?\n\nHe rubbed a few people the wrong way a couple of times. I like James. Him and Keshia [Knight Pulliam] didn\u2019t get along, really, and him and Brandi [Glanville] didn\u2019t get along. But it is what it is.\n\nFriday was your ninth day in the house. What was it like for you?\n\nIt was a long time but it was fun. I was ready for it to start ramping up so I could actually start to do something every day. I had to sit through the long part and now I\u2019m missing the short run.\n\nDid you get bored?\n\nWe were keeping ourselves entertained. Everyone was making me laugh. We had a lot of great discussions. I wasn\u2019t that bored. I would have liked to be a little more active and do more things. I was also worried about when they were going to do the challenges so I wasn\u2019t working out as hard as I would have liked. And the food was amazing! Keshia\u2019s kitchen was amazing. She was cooking some really good food, not to mention Omarosa. Shannon [Elizabeth] made some great stuff, too.\n\nCliff Lipson/CBS\n\nSo who you were the most surprised to see when you came into the house?\n\nJames, just because he\u2019s a friend of mine and I know him outside the house. I met him through a mutual friend and we hung out quite a few times. I have his number in my phone. I\u2019ve known him for a while.\n\nWhat do James and Chuck do when they hang out?\n\nI might plead the fifth on that. We go out and have a good time. We\u2019ve been to quite a few places, quite a few parties.\n\nDo you think the fact that you knew each other helped the both of you to get into the house? Did one refer the other?\n\nNeither one of us had any idea we were going to be in the house. He and I have been busy and haven\u2019t talked in a long time. It had probably been a year. It was nice to reconnect with him.\n\nYou came into this game with a tough-guy image. Did you have any fear of someday having to dress up like, say, a baby?\n\nI was less worried about that than James. That\u2019s why it was so funny that James had to wear it. I don\u2019t care. Doing something like that to be funny is awesome. I would have worn it. That\u2019s one of the reasons Mark [McGrath] and James wouldn\u2019t grab the bags. They were worried about getting the BB swag and having to walk around in a Borat costume. I\u2019m like, \u2018And? What\u2019s wrong with that?\u2019 Who cares!\n\nWhat did you think of Omarosa?\n\nEveryone said her reputation was being a source of trouble. I met her before at a UFC event and we were cool. I thought she was great. I had nothing but great conversations with her.\n\nDid you just view this as a stepping stone to The Amazing Race?\n\nYes. I\u2019m hoping they get me into The Amazing Race now. I\u2019ve been trying to get in that for a long time. My wife loves that show. Maybe it will work.\n\nCelebrity Big Brother airs Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.
