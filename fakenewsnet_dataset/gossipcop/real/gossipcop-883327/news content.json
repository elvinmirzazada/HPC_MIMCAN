[MUSIC] Francis is the character that you played in Divorce. It's a very different character than the last character you played Kelly Brancheau. Is that means Vin is being described as the anti Kelly Brancheau which I'm not sure is is exactly accurate, but- Right. This is a completely different sort of situation. Different character for you. Yeah, that's why it's compelling to me. That's why I wanted to, when I first started developing this show, I didn't know who the woman would be, and I wasn't developing it for me. It was just something among many things that we were working on. I think the reason I couldn't say no to playing her, when HBO made it clear that they assumed I was, was that she is wonderfully different than Carrie Bradshaw, in every way different from me. The three of us look alike, that's basically it. But All the things that made Carrie interesting, in terms of her being different, I finally found in somebody else. They aren't the same differences than me but they are equally as challenging and exciting and daunting and thrilling to try to sort out. So I finally found a character Then I was like, yeah. I want to come home again. How is she different from you? Everything. I mean, her life choices have been really different. What's asked of her has been different.

She has a lot of real Financial worries that I think keep her up at night and confuse her in terms of the meeting her own needs verses meeting those of people around her. She lives outside the city because it's necessary and been asked of her. So there there is a huge amount of a What might have been and still can be. That I haven't been asked those choices. I've been able to make choices in my life. And I've not had those same worries.
