The director spoke only Japanese, so we communicated through an interpreter. We talked briefly about how well the camera tests had gone and how excited we were about the project. Then he told me there was something specific he had come to discuss: the issue of my weight. He said the film studio would provide a trainer and a meal plan for me and it would be great if I could lose roughly five pounds before we began shooting.\n\nIt took me years to find the humor in being asked to lose such a relatively minimal number of pounds through an interpreter. I was 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed just 120 pounds. I remember this number precisely because five pounds lighter would make me 115 pounds, which is the number I ended up achieving after I spent two weeks eating only the deli meat off Subway sandwiches and skipping dinners altogether.\n\nWomen have always had to carry the burden of molding the shapes and sizes of our bodies to the trends and tastes of others, at any cost. We are assigned a look. We don\u2019t get to choose.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/07/opinion/07tamblynWeb/07tamblynWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f8505ab69bb94d8f8921a2abadab092bd4d5d5f9a49ccba29b8f5ad6ef2b724f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/07/opinion/07tamblynWeb/merlin_131903573_3eda0a47-aef2-443c-b3e4-6d5b75fe2fea-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/07/opinion/07tamblynWeb/07tamblynWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f8505ab69bb94d8f8921a2abadab092bd4d5d5f9a49ccba29b8f5ad6ef2b724f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amber Tamblyn"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/sunday/amber-tamblyn-golden-globes-metoo.html", "title": "Amber Tamblyn: Redefining the Red Carpet - The New York Times", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "At the Golden Globes, my fellow actresses aren\u2019t just wearing black.
