I should have risen above it,\u201d she continued. \u201cI personally will no longer engage with you on social media and perpetuate the hate. I am asking you to do the same. We are grown women with families. Enough is enough. I want us to move on.\u201d\n\nShe concluded: \u201cIf you continue this, it will be because you are attempting to stay on the show and stay relevant and that\u2019s on you.\u201d\n\nShortly after posting, the reality star received support from her daughter Ariana Biermann.\n\n\u201cI love you!\u201d Ariana, 16, wrote in the comments section. \u201cEveryone knows the truth and knows the amazing women and mom you are!\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Zolciak Biermann \u2018Is Done\u2019 on RHOA, Says Andy Cohen\n\nZolciak-Biermann and Leakes butted heads throughout the latest season, with their fights often spilling over to social media.
