Starring John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Sara Gilbert, Lecy Goranson and Michael Fishman, \u201cThe Conners\u201d will air in \u201cRoseanne\u2019s\u201d vacated Tuesdays from 8 p.m.-8:30 p.m. time slot.\n\nABC said that the former star will not have any creative or financial participation in the new series.\n\n\u201cI regret the circumstances that have caused me to be removed from Roseanne. I agreed to the settlement in order that 200 jobs of beloved cast and crew could be saved, and I wish the best for everyone involved,\u201d Barr said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to have reached this agreement to keep our team working as we continue to explore stories of the Conner family,\u201d executive producer Tom Werner added.\n\nThe cast released a joint statement at the same time, expressing their happiness at being able to continue the show without Barr.\n\n\u201cWe have received a tremendous amount of support from fans of our show, and it\u2019s clear that these characters not only have a place in our hearts, but in the hearts and homes of our audience,\u201d their statement said. \u201cWe all came back last season because we wanted to tell stories about the challenges facing a working-class family today. We are so happy to have the opportunity to return with the cast and crew to continue to share those stories through love and laughter.\u201d\n\nFans, however, were slower to express happiness at the Conner family\u2019s big return.\n\n\u201cYuck. This is really stupid,\u201d one Twitter user said after the news broke. \u201cSo are they just gonna pretend the loudmouth matriarch of the clan just doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has to be one of the most shameless moves in TV history,\u201d another user said.\n\nBut others were excited.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what I said they should have done,\u201d another Twitter user wrote. \u201cSo happy everyone who should be involved will be.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is how we should deal with every racist, homophobe, anti-immigrant, conspiracy-spewer, and miscellaneous deplorable: move on without them,\u201d someone else tweeted.\n\nSee more reactions below.\n\nBlacklisted! But Peter Fonda can threaten a child with rape? Really America? Are we going to stand for this? How can you have Roseanne without Roseanne?? https://t.co/kGvlR9oU8e \u2014 Stacey DASH (@staceydash) June 22, 2018\n\nAn early look at the opening scene of THE CONNERS pic.twitter.com/ZfInAQPCCG \u2014 Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) June 22, 2018\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Diane_7A/status/1009960045357031424\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GerrickKennedy/status/1009958591325863936\n\nIMO: The stars of \"The Conners\" deserve to work and they deserve better than having to deal with the questions and ramifications and ripples and associations that this puts them in line to deal with. Shrug. \u2014 Daniel Fienberg (@TheFienPrint) June 22, 2018\n\nThe Roseanne free 'Roseanne' is now called 'The Conners' & gets a season order, this has to be one of the most shameless moves in TV history https://t.co/DvbFXQxYkY \u2014 Cameron Williams (@MrCamW) June 22, 2018\n\nWho said they wanted a Roseanne spinoff called \"The Conners\". Just give it up. Roseanne is a disgusting, rabid Trump supporter and no matter what you call the show her footprint will be all over it.
