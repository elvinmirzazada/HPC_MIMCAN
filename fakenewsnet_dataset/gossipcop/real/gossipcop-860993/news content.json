Teresa has been visiting her husband, Joe, on a weekly basis, yet sources claim that she\u2019s already moved on to another man.\n\nAccording to Us Magazine, Teresa\u2019s prison visits have gotten less frequent over the past month. While the couple\u2019s kids continue to talk to their dad on the phone, Teresa has started dating a businessman from New Jersey and hasn\u2019t seen Joe in months. In fact, Teresa\u2019s former friend, Kim DePaola, claims that she\u2019s been dating the man for almost half a year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been pretty cozy I\u2019m going to say in the last five months,\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile Teresa is getting a little side action while her husband is in prison, DePaola doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s doing anything wrong. After all, Joe has allegedly cheated on Teresa on multiple occasions, though they have both denied it.\n\n\u201cI think Teresa has every right to go out and find somebody else. She should leave Joe,\u201d DePaola added.\n\nIn light of the cheating rumors, The Hollywood Gossip reports that Teresa\u2019s lawyer, James J. Leonard Jr., revealed that Teresa is not having an affair while Joe is behind bars. Not only does she deny the reports, but Leonard slammed the people who started the rumors, calling them \u201cattention-seeking lowlifes.\u201d\n\nDePaola, on the other hand, is sticking by her story. In fact, she says that two different people told her about Teresa Giudice\u2019s affair. At the end of the day, DePaola, who is currently involved in a feud with Teresa, believes she should leave Joe and start a new life with somebody else.\n\nTo make matters worse, OK Magazine reports that Joe is on the list for deportation. The Italian-born business man is not a U.S. citizen and is serving a three-year sentence for fraud. Unless Teresa can get the government to wave Joe\u2019s deportation status, then it\u2019s only a matter of time before he is sent back to Italy.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling if Teresa can keep Joe in the U.S. Joe\u2019s fate will be determined by how he obtained a green card. If the reality star applied for a green card while in the U.S. then Teresa could win her case. If not, then Joe will likely be deported.\n\nTell us!
