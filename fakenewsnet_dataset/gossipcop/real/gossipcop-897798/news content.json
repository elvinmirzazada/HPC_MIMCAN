{"url": "https://people.com/music/lil-peep-memorial-service-family-friends/", "text": "Friends, fans and family gathered to pay tribute to late rapper Lil Peep during a memorial service on Saturday.\n\nLil Peep (whose real name was Gustav \u00c5hr) died on Nov. 15 from a suspected drug overdose, although a definitive cause of death will not be determined until full toxicology results are published. He was 21.\n\nThe service, which took place in the rapper\u2019s hometown of Long Beach, New York, was announced on the late rapper\u2019s official Instagram account, and promised to be a celebration of his \u201cfascinating colorful life.\u201d\n\nPeep\u2019s grandmother Jenny Kastner began the memorial \u2014 which you can watch in the video above \u2014 by commenting on the number of fan letters she\u2019d read since his passing, and how touched she was by how many of the rapper\u2019s fans seemed to \u201creally get him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any famous person that\u2019s let the outside regular people like me, that aren\u2019t famous, into their lives,\u201d wrote one fan. \u201cHe was completely unique, a gift from God that was handed to us for a short period of time to change the world for the better.\u201d\n\nWhile another fan wrote that: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the modern-day Kurt Cobain, by the way. He is the first and only Lil Peep, and arguably left behind a legacy that will have a far greater impact. His kindness will live on through lots of people.\u201d\n\nLater in the service, Peep\u2019s mother, Liza Womack, pointed out that despite appearances, her son was vulnerable too.\n\n\u201cHe hurt terribly when his friends said he was no longer welcome in their homes. Once he had stopped performing well in school and had stopped playing sports,\u201d she said. \u201cLong before that though, Gus understood that many good people suffered injustice because of what they looked like or how much money they had.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saw how the cool kids who lived in the fancy neighborhoods looked down on his friends \u2014 and looked down on his own family who lived in an apartment and drove an old Nissan. Gus got fed up with that world. He rejected it and he rejected being molded into a box,\u201d she continued. \u201c[And] when he locked himself in the garage and got his first tattoo, he began to make his rejection of the box public.\u201d\n\nSwan Gallet/WWD/REX/Shutterstock\n\nHis mother implored his fans not to \u201cmake assumptions about people or events in ignorance.\u201d Womack added, \u201cAsk yourself these questions: \u2018Do I really know this person? Have I sat down face to face and asked him to tell me about himself? \u2026 Am I dismissing this person because he does not match my definition of a \u201cgood kid\u201d ?\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe also shared a detail about her son that even his most loyal fans might find surprising. \u201cGus and his housemates had a weekly Frank Sinatra night,\u201d she added. \u201cHis favorite song to sing was \u2018Fly Me to the Moon,\u2019 and he was f\u2014ing good at singing it.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Lil Peep Dead At 21: Emotional Bella Thorne Mourns Rapper Ex as Celebs Pay Tribute\n\nVenturelli/WireImage\n\nEmma Harris, a longtime friend \u2014 and former girlfriend \u2014 of the deceased rapper, talked about how she started falling in love with him in the fifth grade because she had \u201cnever met anyone who colored his hair more than me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d make me laugh until I cried,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s physically possible to shed more tears for anyone.\u201d\n\nShe also added that before his career took off, Peep \u201calways knew he\u2019d be something more. And I can truly say that I don\u2019t think anybody who knew him doubted that.\u201d\n\nScott Dudelson/Getty\n\nIt was recently reported that police are investigating whether the powerful opioid drug fentanyl may have played a role in Peep\u2019s death.\n\nPolice are said to have received \u201cmultiple tips\u201d that Peep was in possession of \u201cincredibly toxic drugs laced with the potent opioid.\u201d The Tucson Police Department have not yet confirmed the reports.", "images":
