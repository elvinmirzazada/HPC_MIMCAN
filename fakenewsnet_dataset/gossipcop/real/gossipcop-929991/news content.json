Oswalt, 49, recalled, \u201cShe always said, \u2018I don\u2019t care about credit. I want to know that he\u2019s in jail.\u2019 And now he\u2019s caught, the bracelets are on and it feels like this thing that she wanted so badly is now done. It just feels amazing.\u201d\n\nThe Golden State Killer \u2014 dubbed as such by McNamara \u2014 was allegedly linked by DNA and method to 12 murders, 45 sexual assaults and more than 120 burglaries from Sacramento to southern California\u2019s Orange County between 1976 and 1986 in California.\n\n\u2022 Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Sacramento County Sheriff's Office\n\nSuspect Joseph James DeAngelo was arrested on April 24. He is currently charged with capital murder in four killings: the February 2, 1978 slayings of Brian and Katie Maggiore in the Sacramento area, and the March 1980 slayings of Lyman and Charlene Smith in Ventura County.\n\nPolice say, however, that they believe he killed many more people.\n\nGregg DeGuire/FilmMagic\n\nMcNamara died in her sleep in 2016 at 46. At the time of her death, she had been working on the book. Oswalt promised he would finish the book for her, and earlier this year, the star \u2014 who writes the afterword \u2014 released I\u2019ll Be Gone in the Dark with the help of other contributors.\n\n\u201cI was still neck deep in grief and suddenly a single father and not sleeping, but I knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to live and go on with life if this was left undone,\u201d he told Meyers of finishing I\u2019ll Be Gone in the Dark. \u201cI basically begged [the co-authors] and the publishers to find a way and they were the ones to find a way and finish it.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Oswalt reacted to the arrest in a video he shared on Instagram and Twitter.\n\n\u201cOne of the more surreal days of my life,\u201d he said. He added while sharing a series of tweets and videos on Twitter and Instagram, \u201cShe would be beyond excited about this. I think this is the definition of \u2018bittersweet.'\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/kyfi0nKJOzmnUG-tlxISi_-3PHQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(794x199:796x201)/stockton-serial-killer-victims-122922-ef7c3ecdb62546f7a526dce982f6c419.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/XEhLpONbbN6vJBEcD0UYgmD5Buw=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/299205911_10221228251043561_3802947305789546517_n-6308b9dca19248448d77186d46cd19c9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/aJ8tABUHbAL8XXSBD6-d5b-qXIg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/joseph-james-deangelo-1-8de5d34210a246589ab343b57c41c245.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/wDImujlkB2E4oV9PwuU8D3SsMaQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x389:766x391)/Alana-Sims-01-020123-1b2a137fd9ad40a2b0baa3f9d63ab899.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/yAUouhuJcZfh6ZuK6GGpv2-jEBw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(689x279:691x281)/Saraiah-Acosta-020623-f97142e0e9e248d9bb00f74d6cbad3d8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/uROWJCVo4TB7526pNK_Js-6116A=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/1122-king-road-house-moscow-bryan-kohberger-010623-1aa-2f70d66f3c114c26aaf3f8406984f7bd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ESElLeJ-dwwpEvV5v_kJ2sWD844=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x239:721x241)/Joseph-DeAngelo-9a8add6e5e2a442fb72d664bcfb39dc0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1dwtJiLx1vT2hPW3WwGiZCgO894=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x212:921x214)/Bryan-Kohberger-010323-2000-0db71987429c49f8b954c119bbdb8afc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/2ePGp9Xd3pV7D5bIgJ0xnDxm-fQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x9:766x11)/Golden-State-Killer-Victims-73744fa8688c46c48638ce2b213d00f1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8JaqN6psUz06ImFghfRidLNnesA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/patton-oswalt-1-2000-b059ec2f5ba242ceba03e33911b9babd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4jTfPwDwCx2GgI7mIukK2HXbVsU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Sheila-Keen-Warren-killer-clown-042623-85610603f9454ee385f235f37be492b4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qgR_en5VppLc59qft6SJ_r1KU9E=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Michelle-McNamara-patton-oswalt-32943887e4fe4750ad441a3ca02b196e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/RlOaElgI1a5s8bV0hVNjg2hu9wE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(713x0:715x2)/patton-oswalt-b-2000-08aef0e5172442e39d410ad8e35c64fd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2xy75NySzomMSjhSuBRr8khAuqo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x439:721x441)/rita-solis-found-dead-040523-2270bc8334924ba9819416d8c05daecc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0vVkcSC9VTv-VeBcbSEnjvKgeI4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/idaho-murder-victims-Ethan-Chapin-Xana-Kernodle-Madison-Mogen-and-Kaylee-Goncalves-111722-9de2e460a9aa44759bd274fab0d9ae13.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/FsW_TD0RTxa2gkzC7I-WsyNvEgc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x305:981x307)/Bryan-Kohberger-123022-9904fa3165d64abdbc55ac2325aebd3c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZZ4pV_EgJx4ldbBAcvUhyGKsMH4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/doodler-killer-tout-022223-e29e331a24a8400db44451b234e2d1be.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1LmC3-q9TJ91gUji_oUoNALnYKc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/lauren-heike-zion-teasley-050523-4-3ed071a84f5d4edcabc78a252feb83a2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/egKyZqZmxC6aIXVBD7tjeQNS9tQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x29:736x31)/betty-rold-murder-120922-d0163081660242bbb39b1831b54a0f01.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/FRZ_vlIRto0DX2HEymsMzCJWIX8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(944x309:946x311)/muslim-men-murdered-albuquerque-080922-798e999ef14143cfb4633ce9035b6be0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/8JaqN6psUz06ImFghfRidLNnesA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/patton-oswalt-1-2000-b059ec2f5ba242ceba03e33911b9babd.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Kimble", "Lindsay Kimble Is The Director Of Newsroom Operations At People.
