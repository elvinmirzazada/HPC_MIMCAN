After going back and forth, Kourtney decided to go, so Kim booked a private jet for them to fly to NYC. But at the last minute \u2014 literally, Kim was sitting on the plane waiting \u2014 Kourtney called and backed out, infuriating her sister.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m indecisive. It\u2019s debilitating,\u201d Kourtney told Khlo\u00e9 when the pair sat down for lunch.\n\nSo, Khlo\u00e9, 32, decided to play a game to try and get Kourtney to make decisions on a whim.\n\n\u201cThis is such a joke,\u201d Kourtney, 38, told the cameras. \u201cNone of this is helpful. I\u2019m getting a headache.\u201d\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t the only thing Khlo\u00e9 had planned for her older sister. Later in the episode she took Kourtney to a fire station to take part in some rigorous drills. After the intense trip to the station, Kourtney realized she needed to make some changes.\n\n\u201cI feel like Scott [Disick] and I were very co-dependent and I just would always bounce every idea off of him,\u201d she explained to Kim and Khlo\u00e9. \u201cAlso, I\u2019m just like living a different life now where doing more for myself is like an option and now that I am able to make my own decisions, I want to make the best decisions. Tony Robbins taught me to make decisions from the heart and not from your head \u2026 I want to start listening.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Scott Disick: I Proposed to Kourtney Kardashian With a Ring \u2014 but We \u2018Never Spoke About It Again\u2019\n\nAlso during the episode, Rob and Blac Chyna are navigating their new relationship of being separated.\n\n\u201cI know that Rob really wants to keep his family together, but I do think this is a good path for them,\u201d Kim, 36, said during her sit-down about her brother and Chyna separating.\n\nIn the episode, Rob went to see Chyna during her photoshoot after not seeing her for quite some time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really nervous. I don\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d he told the cameras.\n\nOnce in there, Rob didn\u2019t stay long, as Chyna was giving him the cold shoulder.\n\n\u201cChyna is acting super weird to me,\u201d he told the cameras. \u201cThere is so much awkward tension between Chyna and I. I don\u2019t know how to act around her.\u201d\n\nWhen he went to go see his mom, Rob, 30, opened up about the issues he had with Chyna.\n\n\u201cEverything is fine. I\u2019m trying to be peaceful,\u201d he told Kris Jenner. \u201cWe just communicate really poorly. It\u2019s all dumb. Fights \u2026 I want to have the type of relationship that you and my dad had \u2026 It would just kill me if we didn\u2019t have that friendship for Dream.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the episode, Rob and Chyna take their baby to a doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\n\u201cI hate that our relationship is a bit uncomfortable, but I\u2019m very committed to building that friendship between Chyna and I, because the type of relationship I had with my dad, I want to have that with my daughter,\u201d he told the cameras. \u201cEverything I\u2019m doing is for her.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/Kajp39w23tgUNsV0HQvfv0e_NuE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x369:721x371)/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-4d71677c05f04e82a2f970f88ef78234.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/PCJUNkz8uU9jm0UU24_ByDh2jxs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(739x157:741x159)/kris-jenner-scott-disick-052623-1-d8981d7b51b1493ca735a65ab1656958.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/F8NJmiJN3eywPrH014TFoY6xuPw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/kourtney-k1-2000-35dbf082d46e46f79b51ea1a6d804b12.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KzwPKmM4z-FV3QJ7KuyTdUCIZMM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(989x309:991x311)/The-Kardashians-Recap-208-01-110222-c56e0b242ea14c0e8f211bb5ff2ba2cb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/R9ZKpbfZrVBmla0hJMOk80tepdY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(359x389:361x391)/kourtney-scott-225b7e2a170c474daaef883e2dae4568.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/b3mER0Fz3D-M_B3QA6ITz5nZ27w=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x449:766x451)/kris-caitlyn-jenner-42ed0eb9a4f9422987dec748a957595c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/a78BVxkIQMI6GEtBC-I9KkWaPgk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x611:961x613)/scott-disick-cca86b3d21f0487b9228ddf9021debb0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/_eybvdKGowLiFnCVBsvWqiZE788=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Kardashians-Joke-Blac-Chyna-Ruined-Kourtneys-Wedding-Fitting-20191125_50-a6b05264ae514e548e413c167407e3d3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/5a3dG05RqKReYLCsJhm_YIVTO_s=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Kourtney-Kardashian-707b360ecea6423f92f4b2e0b33d6aba.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KRbJXmqGUkmBzxQQ0MmAMaSXEgk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Kourtney-Kardashian-e45e493a1deb4b12854c9bf69aa31021.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NqMrHTwL421L8IbjFL7lmn67LrA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(569x0:571x2)/gettyimages-120624831-1-3b582610fcb5426580ee80d8daf7d7bd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tAF6r4MmNGKuVUmq-G-DjF-GCWw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(585x0:587x2)/kim-khloe-kourtney-1-2000-386c911007b04cd3ba117b190ee06ea4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8eQUdsC57s36Op_a6poU8sKagnA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(879x14:881x16)/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-2000-f032f18bee6e4e6b9c4289e8962cc0b5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/abhXjL_iaEEwax8ZwWOhNM-6tX4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x369:766x371)/sofia-richie-scott-disick-kourney-kardashian-ca1fd018e937424bb8e875b4c00a8c17.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/dD7ZYtHvqgBftW42YraYpR4-6Go=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(794x369:796x371)/kendall-kylie-corey-504a3f0160424a68979210e50a678f0e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/dCxtCxKmKGa8cOZsDY-JR7xpm-k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(594x0:596x2)/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-ff4b9c0db0154652b059be3019dec921.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HVFfH25NJm2S5sHMRQKTpG7aKe4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x599:961x601)/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-tout-efe2a8aec78943228831d11be4e9ae25.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/F8NJmiJN3eywPrH014TFoY6xuPw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/kourtney-k1-2000-35dbf082d46e46f79b51ea1a6d804b12.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brittany King", "Brittany King Is A Former Entertainment Senior Editor-Reporter At People.
