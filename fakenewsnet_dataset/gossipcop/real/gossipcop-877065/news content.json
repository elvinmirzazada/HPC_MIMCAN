Enter her longtime trainer, Anna Kaiser. \"I train her at a low-impact, sustained-cardio level to up her endurance and stamina,\" says Kaiser. \"We also train with high intensity intervals to boost recovery time for those moments when she goes crazy onstage, then has to recover and keep singing!\" Kaiser gave us a few insider secrets about how she trains Shakira that you can use the next time you need a little bit of an endurance boost (or the next time you embark on a multicity world tour, if that's your thing).\n\nShakira with Kaiser's baby and Kaiser in the studio Anna Kaiser\n\nPlay around with your heart rate.\n\nYou don't need a heart rate monitor or anything to do this\u2014 just keep some variation in the type of workouts you do. Shakira does two days a week of interval work on the treadmill, using Kaiser's AKTread system, dance-based interval training three days a week, and then two sessions per week of low-impact sustained cardio, like walking or swimming. \"In the interval training workouts, the focus is spiking her heart rate and recovering quickly, and in the low-impact sustained, the focus is [keeping] her heart rate [steady] for a long period of time,\" explains Kaiser. Both help you build stamina and boost energy!", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6542a69931f3911a9964c919/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78ac0f20bee472a343e6e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/shakira-exclusive-sociak.jpeg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78a550c5e4e0d3695984c/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/shakira-lede.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/65426a0b31f3911a9964c8c5/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/654a50012f36622017ca5c09/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_800%2Cq_80%2Cw_800/v1509031078/glamour_p-nk-watches-fan-covers-on-youtube.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78ac0f20bee472a343e6e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shakira-exclusive-sociak.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78ac0f20bee472a343e6e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shakira-exclusive-sociak.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Sara Gaynes Levy", "October"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/how-shakira-is-prepping-for-her-el-dorado-world-tour", "title": "The Secrets Behind Shakira's 'El Dorado' World Tour Prep", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Shakira is working with longtime trainer Anna Kaiser to prep for her upcoming El Dorado World Tour, doing two-a-day workouts and focusing on her endurance so she can perform at her best.", "id": "59f756e65b645f2e900dd9c1", "keywords": "shakira,celebrity fitness,workouts", "news_keywords": "shakira,celebrity fitness,workouts", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59f756e65b645f2e900dd9c1", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Shakira is working with longtime trainer Anna Kaiser to prep for her upcoming El Dorado World Tour, doing two-a-day workouts and focusing on her endurance so she can perform at her best.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78a4a3eead34abcacd6fb/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/shakira-performing-river.jpeg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78a4a3eead34abcacd6fb/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/shakira-performing-river.jpeg\"}", "og": {"description": "She's doing two-a-day workouts to get ready!", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78ac0f20bee472a343e6e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shakira-exclusive-sociak.jpeg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "The Secrets of Shakira's 'El Dorado' World Tour Prep", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/how-shakira-is-prepping-for-her-el-dorado-world-tour"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-11-03T15:14:31.151Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-03T15:14:31.151Z", "author": "Sara Gaynes Levy"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "She's doing two-a-day workouts to get ready!", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78ac0f20bee472a343e6e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shakira-exclusive-sociak.jpeg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "The Secrets of Shakira's 'El Dorado' World Tour Prep"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78ac0f20bee472a343e6e/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/shakira-exclusive-sociak.jpeg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509722071.151, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
