Just make sure they don\u2019t touch my two-egg scramble. I seem crazy, no? Clearly I\u2019m not having a good week. Adam, of three years, announces he went on a date, and that takes me by surprise. But it\u2019s not as surprising as the passive-aggressive digs my friend continues to make about me. I see you\u2026\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of New York City on Peacock and catch up on the Bravo app.\n\nBethenny can invite whomever the hell she wants to Puerto Rico, but could it be that I didn\u2019t express any interest in going because she didn\u2019t express any interest in having me go? I didn\u2019t know she and Dorinda were going until they were already there. While she talks smack about me on the show, I\u2019m saying how proud I am of her. Wow\u2026at this point, I'm just sitting back with popcorn like the rest of you, watching this TV character (who I thought was a good friend) continue to take cheap shots. It\u2019s strange that she would say I have no interest in what is going on in Puerto Rico. I was writing checks. I\u2019d asked her many times how things were going. A good friend of mine works with Michael Capponi, and I connected her and Bethenny.\n\nOn the other hand, I really don\u2019t give a damn, because my actions speak for themselves. I won\u2019t bore you here recounting the endless places I\u2019ve been to or the stories I\u2019ve brought back exposing neglect, destruction, and people\u2019s sufferings. I did a story once on the landmine crisis, and the head of the campaign went on to win a Noble Peace prize. I\u2019m not bragging \u2014 it wasn\u2019t my prize \u2014 but I brought attention to a horrible atrocity, and a good thing happened as a result. It may not be private planes, cargo ships, and cash cards, but it\u2019s something.\n\nI am socially aware and politically active. Even when it is uncomfortable, as you saw last season, when I was part of a large \u201cget out the vote\u201d campaign for Hillary Clinton. I know, I know \u2014 I was wrong. Trump won. Sure, it didn\u2019t end as I would have liked (understatement), but I remain committed to the idea that good government will bring about good change. I am also grateful to private citizens like Bethenny who step up to fill in the gaping holes. I just don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s fully committed this season to talking about me as though I\u2019m a Miss America contestant who banged her prom date. Haahaahaaa.\n\nMaybe we\u2019ll find out next week. Pass the popcorn!", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2021/05/luann-delesseps-carole-radziwill-update.jpg?itok=5XgHCwXU", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2022/08/carole-radziwill-coronavirus-quarantine-rhony.jpg?itok=0p3r2akx", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/08/rhony-carole-radziwill-adam-kenworthy.jpg?itok=8TEf9u7_", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/07/robyn-dixon-skincare-business.jpg?itok=HYmaLIBv", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/04/alexia-nepola-frankie-rosello-wwhl.jpg?itok=PvjMMiiN", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/bravo_video_thumbnails/NBCU_Bravo/577/678/180501_3714402_Bethenny_Chooses_Dorinda_Over_Carole.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2021/11/daily-dish-dolores-catania-bedtime-by-bravo.jpeg?itok=VCDTb7Dd", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/06/bethenny-frankel-rhony-history-promote.jpg?itok=DhFMFV1z", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/themes/custom/reality/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2021/06/yolanda-hadid-life-update.jpeg?itok=oI8R2tRW", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2022/05/style-living-rhony-bethenny-frankel-carole-tinsley-makeup-looks.jpg?itok=jbDjH6j0", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/Erika-Jayne.jpg?itok=Y2WJV_vf", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2022/10/carole_radziwell_promote.jpg?itok=Y_Jya_vZ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2022/10/carole_promote.jpg?itok=CQYX4Osw", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/577/678/180501_3714402_Bethenny_Chooses_Dorinda_Over_Carole.jpg?itok=XSaJrOsB", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2022/01/style-living-rhony-carole-radziwill-health.jpg?itok=VvACeVcL", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2022/08/style-living-ig-rhony-carole-radziwill-bikinis.jpg?itok=diRknB8T", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2021/06/carole-radziwill-breakfast.jpg?itok=Jy5X2j-E"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/bravo_video_thumbnails/NBCU_Bravo/577/678/180501_3714402_Bethenny_Chooses_Dorinda_Over_Carole.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-real-housewives-of-new-york-city/season-10/blogs/carole-radziwill/carole-radziwill-my-actions", "title": "Carole Radziwill: My Actions Speak for Themselves", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1136856, "parsely-section": "Show Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Carole Radziwill: My Actions Speak for Themselves\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Real Housewives of New York City\"},\"field_tv_shows\":\"The Real Housewives of New York City\",\"field_microsite\":\"1075811\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075811\",\"site_section\":\"The Real Housewives of New York City\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/bravo_video_thumbnails\\/NBCU_Bravo\\/577\\/678\\/180501_3714402_Bethenny_Chooses_Dorinda_Over_Carole.jpg?itok=fksOVP0y\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/bravo_video_thumbnails\\/NBCU_Bravo\\/577\\/678\\/180501_3714402_Bethenny_Chooses_Dorinda_Over_Carole.jpg?itok=O3ayNMAz\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/bravo_video_thumbnails\\/NBCU_Bravo\\/577\\/678\\/180501_3714402_Bethenny_Chooses_Dorinda_Over_Carole.jpg?itok=Z6iXJ89e\",\"70x70\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/fp_scale_crop_70x70\\/public\\/bravo_video_thumbnails\\/NBCU_Bravo\\/577\\/678\\/180501_3714402_Bethenny_Chooses_Dorinda_Over_Carole.jpg?itok=7rTDhc23\"}}", "description": "Well, maybe I\u2019m not into Bethenny this week, but I\u2019m obviously into hard boiled eggs!
