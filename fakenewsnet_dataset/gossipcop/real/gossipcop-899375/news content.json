The collection acquired a Greatest TV Comedy or Musical nomination, as did Eric McCormack, however what about Sean Hayes? Sean Hayes has not missed a beat and nonetheless stays an professional at bodily comedy. Youthful actors take observe!\n\nVictoria Will/Invision/AP SURPRISE: Kevin Bacon\n\nGolden Globes are all the time good to offer out a nomination to someone in a streaming collection you in all probability by no means heard of.
