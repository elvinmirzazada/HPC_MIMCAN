It's called \"Gorgeous,\" and the beginning of the song starts out with a baby\u2014like, an actual baby\u2014cooing the word gorgeous. Swift teased this detail about the track hours before she released it, but that's not stopping fans from obsessing to the max. Why did she make this call? And, more important, who the hell is the baby?\n\nTwitter might have the answer to that second question. The dominant fan theory with Swifties on social media right now is that Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' daughter, James, is the one saying \"gorgeous.\"\n\n\"It is rumoured that the child\u2019s voice at the start of Taylor\u2019s Swift\u2019s new song, #Gorgeous is Blake and Ryan\u2019s daughter James,\" a tweet from a Lively news Twitter handle reads. See it for yourself, below:\n\nX content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAnd then there's this message from Swift herself on Tumblr. When a fan asked her the identity of the mystery baby, she said, \"300 people know,\" referring to the fans who've heard the album ahead of time during her Reputation secret sessions. A mysterious answer like this must mean something juicy, right?", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e9e2c353fea83fa7e0215b/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/TAYLOR-SWIFT.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/65301f1f11f0058449706172/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_800%2Cq_80%2Cw_800/v1507849003/glamour_senator-cory-booker-talks-about-the-importance-of-doing-good-for-others.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/654d40a1d067bc4e09d989dd/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6557ba3c5248f9740d03ad6a/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e9e2c353fea83fa7e0215b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/TAYLOR-SWIFT.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e9e2c353fea83fa7e0215b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/TAYLOR-SWIFT.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christopher Rosa", "October"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/blake-lively-daughter-says-gorgeous-in-new-taylor-swift-song", "title": "Fans Think Blake Lively's Daughter Is the One Saying 'Gorgeous' in Taylor Swift's New Song", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "This celebrity baby is reportedly the one saying 'Gorgeous' in Taylor Swift's new song.
