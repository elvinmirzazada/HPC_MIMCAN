Then, the funny reaction tweets inevitably roll in summing up the show like this.\n\nBut model Tabria Majors recently took it a step further by recreating several Victoria's Secret advertisements, and the results are inspiring. The side-by-side pictures show her in the same poses as Victoria's Secret models.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been wanting to recreate a few VS looks for a while now, primarily to showcase a different body type in their lingerie,\" Majors says of her inspiration to shoot the images. \"So many women are relating to those photos, and that\u2019s the message I want to convey.\"\n\nThe response has been overwhelmingly positive. Fans have been posting comments like, \"This is so inspiring to women around the world! Everybody is beautiful.\"\n\n\"They ALL look amazing,\" another commenter writes. \"Curvy, slim etc. We need to stop the distinctions and comparison of women to women... and just appreciate that all women are beautiful in their own unique way.\"\n\nCommenters are pointing out how her gorgeous reimagining of the ads emphasize how lingerie companies could be more diverse and size-inclusive. \"I feel sexy and confident in lingerie, and I think that\u2019s a great message VS conveys,\" Majors says. \"However, they should show that ALL women can be confident.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Majors, a Brooklyn, New York-based model, has been outspoken on Instagram. In 2016, she called out Urban Outfitters in a post because they stopped carrying a size 12 and detailed how some photographers have said they don't want to work with her due to her size.\n\n\n\nMajors is a rising star in the modeling world. In October, she was selected as an open-casting-call finalist for Sport\u2019s Illustrated's 2018 Swimsuit Issue, and she'll appear in that issue next year.\n\nAnd who knows? She could very well be on her way to a Victoria's Secret fashion show soon. \"I would love to see any curvy model walk in a VS fashion show,\" Majors says, \"and I would be honored to have the opportunity to do so.\"\n\nGet non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed.
