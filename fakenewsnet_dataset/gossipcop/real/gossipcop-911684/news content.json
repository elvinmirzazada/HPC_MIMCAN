He earned a reputation as a \"kissing bandit\" on The Bachelorette and, at age 36, E News! noted that he's one of the oldest Bachelor contestants ever.\n\nRight now, though, he's being eclipsed for attention by one of the ladies competing to become his bride: Bekah Martinez, who turned up on a Humboldt County, California missing persons list after she told her mother that she was going to work on a marijuana farm \u2014 and hadn't been heard from since Nov. 12, 2017. She joked about it, tweeting, \"MOM. how many times do I have to tell you I don't get cell service on The Bachelor??\"\n\nMOM. how many times do I have to tell you I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get cell service on The Bachelor?? https://t.co/iYnxQCIZBt \u2014 bekah martinez \u00e2\u0099\u00a1 (@whats_ur_sign_) February 2, 2018\n\nShe was the main topic of conversation in Luyendyk Jr.'s interview with LIVE with Kelly and Ryan (via E! News), in which he said that it's a \"PSA to call your mother.\"\n\nKelly Ripa is convinced that Martinez is the chosen one, because not even her mother knew where she was and the winners go into lockdown before the final rose is revealed.\n\nThat would sure be an, um, uplifting ending to Season 22.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/07/robyn-dixon-skincare-business.jpg?itok=HYmaLIBv", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-020518-bekah-martinez.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/Erika-Jayne.jpg?itok=Y2WJV_vf", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/themes/custom/reality/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/04/alexia-nepola-frankie-rosello-wwhl.jpg?itok=PvjMMiiN", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/217/67/170426_3508865_Parker_Young_s_Roommate_Was_on_The_Bachelor.jpg?itok=xRMTaZMD"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-020518-bekah-martinez.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/the-bachelor-arie-luyendyk-jr-jokes-about-bekah-martinezs-disappearance", "title": "'Bachelor' Arie Luyendyk Jr. on Bekah Martinez's Disappearance", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1133306, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"'Bachelor' Arie Luyendyk Jr. on Bekah's \\\"Disappearance\\\"\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/02\\/dish-020518-bekah-martinez.jpg?itok=kGWo1BZc\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/02\\/dish-020518-bekah-martinez.jpg?itok=gjYtiVff\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/02\\/dish-020518-bekah-martinez.jpg?itok=RtGieyY3\",\"70x70\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/fp_scale_crop_70x70\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/02\\/dish-020518-bekah-martinez.jpg?itok=2YJua39S\"}}", "description": "Arie\u00a0Luyendyk Jr.\u00a0was named\u00a0The Bachelor\u00a0for Season 22 after appearing on Season 8 of\u00a0The Bachelorette\u00a0with Emily Maynard in 2012.", "og": {"site_name": "Bravo TV Official Site", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/the-bachelor-arie-luyendyk-jr-jokes-about-bekah-martinezs-disappearance", "title": "The Bachelor's Arie Luyendyk Jr. Jokes About Bekah Martinez's \"Disappearance\" | Bravo TV Official Site", "description": "Arie\u00a0Luyendyk Jr.\u00a0was named\u00a0The Bachelor\u00a0for Season 22 after appearing on Season 8 of\u00a0The Bachelorette\u00a0with Emily Maynard in 2012.", "image": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-020518-bekah-martinez.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-05T15:35:35-05:00", "modified_time": "2023-09-28T21:49:02-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1592250694320227}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Arie\u00a0Luyendyk Jr.\u00a0was named\u00a0The Bachelor\u00a0for Season 22 after appearing on Season 8 of\u00a0The Bachelorette\u00a0with Emily Maynard in 2012.", "site": "@bravotv", "title": "The Bachelor's Arie Luyendyk Jr. Jokes About Bekah Martinez's \"Disappearance\" | Bravo TV Official Site", "url": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/the-bachelor-arie-luyendyk-jr-jokes-about-bekah-martinezs-disappearance", "image": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-020518-bekah-martinez.jpg"}, "Generator": "Drupal 9 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "vertical_name": "The Daily Dish"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517862935.0, "source": "http://www.bravotv.com", "summary": ""}
