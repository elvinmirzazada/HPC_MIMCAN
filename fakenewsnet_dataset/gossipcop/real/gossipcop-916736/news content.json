All the billboards feature the couple's newborn daughter, Alexis.\n\n\"These just went up on alongside I-10 into Palm Springs. @olympiaohanian & I wanted to welcome her back to tennis. Designed them myself, with some help from Jr.,\" he captioned the photo stream, along with the hashtag \"#GMOAT,\" which stands for Greatest Mother of All Time.\n\nInstagram\n\nWilliams, 36, responded to the photos in the comments section, writing: \"Literally am crying. This is so sweet. I love you.\"\n\nOhanian responded, \"See you soon, GMOAT.\"\n\nIn the August issue of Vanity Fair, the power couple shared their love story, which began at a hotel in Rome, Italy. Ohanian was seated at a table nearby Williams for breakfast, which displeased the athlete, so she joked with him that there was a rat in the restaurant in an effort to get him to move.\n\n\"I\u2019m from Brooklyn. I see rats all the time,\" he responded. That's when Williams asked him to join her party, and the rest is history.\n\nCheck out more of Williams and Ohanian's love story:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/serena_alexis_675654210.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-11%2Fserena_alexis_675654210.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2020-03/gettyimages-462328115_0.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-01%2Fcrop_serena_williams_vogue.jpg%3Fh%3D76edb349&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fserenawilliams_1280.jpg%3Fh%3Df9009a10&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/serena_alexis_675654210.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/serena-williams-cries-over-husband-alexis-ohanian-surprising-her-with-billboards-of-their-baby", "title": "Serena Williams Cries Over Husband Alexis Ohanian Surprising Her With Billboards of Their Baby", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/serena_alexis_675654210.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The Reddit co-founder welcomed his wife back to tennis in a big way.", "title": "Serena Williams Cries Over Husband Alexis Ohanian Surprising Her With Billboards of Their Baby", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/serena-williams-cries-over-husband-alexis-ohanian-surprising-her-with-billboards-of-their-baby", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The Reddit co-founder welcomed his wife back to tennis in a big way.", "twitter": {"description": "The Reddit co-founder welcomed his wife back to tennis in a big way.", "title": "Serena Williams Cries Over Husband Alexis Ohanian Surprising Her With Billboards of Their Baby", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/serena-williams-cries-over-husband-alexis-ohanian-surprising-her-with-billboards-of-their-baby", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/serena_alexis_675654210.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Serena Williams Cries Over Husband Alexis Ohanian Surprising Her With Billboards of Their Baby  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Serena Williams, Alexis Ohanian", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
