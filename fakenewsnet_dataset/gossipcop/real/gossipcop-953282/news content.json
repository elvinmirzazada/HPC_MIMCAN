It is not to be confused with Ateez , a South Korean boy band, or A-Teen , a South Korean internet drama series.\n\nA-Teens (stylized as A\u2605TEENS or A*Teens) were a Swedish pop music group[1] from Stockholm. The group was formed by Niklas Berg in 1998 as an ABBA tribute group called ABBA-Teens which was later renamed A-Teens. The band members were Marie Serneholt, Amit Paul, Dhani Lennevald, and Sara Lumholdt. The group is best known for the singles \"Mamma Mia\" (1999) and \"Upside Down\" (2000), both of which were hits worldwide. The group was particularly successful in their home country where they amassed ten top 10 hit singles on the Swedish charts.\n\nAfter six years together, the group disbanded following the release of their Greatest Hits album in May 2004.[2]\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\n1998\u20132000: The ABBA Generation [ edit ]\n\nThe original logo that the band used for their first releases under the original name, ABBA-Teens\n\nIn 1998, Marie, Sara, Dhani, and Amit came together to form the ABBA-Teens and began recording their debut album which would consist entirely of covers of ABBA songs. Their first single, \"Mamma Mia\", was first released in April 1999 in their native Sweden where it stayed at number one for eight consecutive weeks. Following this release, the group's name was changed to the A-Teens to avoid litigation.[3][4] \"Mamma Mia\" was released internationally following their name change and topped the charts in over ten countries.[citation needed]\n\nThe official A-Teens logo\n\nIn August 1999, the group released their debut album The ABBA Generation, consisting entirely of ABBA covers reinterpreted with a modern pop and electronic sound. The album reached number one in Sweden and Argentina. In the United States, the album peaked at seventy-one on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart and was certified Gold.[5] The album sold more than 2 million copies worldwide and was certified Gold or Platinum in over 22 countries.[citation needed] Further singles from the album were hits in Sweden: \"Super Trouper\" peaked at number two and \"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) peaked at number ten; both songs charted moderately worldwide. \"Happy New Year\" was released as a standalone single in Sweden at the end of 1999 and peaked at number four.\n\nIn March 2000, the group released the single \"Dancing Queen\". The single reached ninety-five on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone, being certified Gold.[citation needed] Coinciding with this release, the band embarked on a promotional tour of the United States and was an opening act for the Britney Spears tour later that summer.[6] The group made several appearances on Disney and Nickelodeon. In September 2000, the A-Teens won a Viva Music Award for Best International Newcomer.[7]\n\n2001: Teen Spirit [ edit ]\n\nOn 26 February 2001, the group released their second studio album Teen Spirit, which consists entirely of original tracks. It debuted at number two in the Swedish Charts. The album peaked at number thirteen on the European Albums Chart.[8] In the United States, the album peaked at number fifty and was certified gold.[9][10]\n\nThe album was preceded by the single \"Upside Down\" in October 2000; this was their first single that was not an ABBA cover song.[11] It peaked at number two in Sweden and was certified 2\u00d7 Platinum.[12] The song reached the top ten in several countries. In the United States, the song was released with the alternate title \"Bouncing Off the Ceiling (Upside Down)\". The song peaked at 93 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the physical single peaked at number six on the Billboard Dance Single Sales component chart.[13][14] The single peaked at number ten in the United Kingdom, becoming their only top ten hit in the country.[15] Later singles from the album were hits in Sweden: \"Halfway Around the World\" peaked at number 7 and \"Sugar Rush\" peaked at number 15, however, these releases were not as successful worldwide.\n\nThe group promoted the album with a forty-three-date tour with Aaron Carter in the U.S.; the group later toured with No Angels in Germany.[6][16][17] The A-Teens also performed on the Radio Disney Live! 2001 World Tour. The same year, Coca-Cola signed the group to become the face of the brand in Thailand.[18] By the end of 2001, Teen Spirit sold over 1 million copies worldwide.\n\nIn December 2001, the group released the Cathy Dennis-penned track \"Heartbreak Lullaby\". The song was recorded for the European soundtrack of the movie \"The Princess Diaries\". The single became another top ten hit for the band in their home country.[19]\n\n2002\u20132003: Pop 'til You Drop! and New Arrival [ edit ]\n\nIn June 2002, the group released their third studio album Pop 'til You Drop!. The album was released exclusively in North America and Argentina.[20] The album debuted and peaked at number forty-five on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart.[21] The album was preceded by the single \"Can't Help Falling In Love\", a cover of the Elvis Presley song, in May 2002. The song was also featured on the soundtrack of the Disney movie Lilo & Stitch.[22] In July 2002, \"Floorfiller\" was released as the second and final single from the album. In the summer of 2002, the group embarked on the Pop 'til You Drop! Tour, a thirty-date tour of the United States and Canada.[23][24] In November 2002, the group performed at the 2002 Swedish Hit Music Awards.[25]\n\nIn January 2003, the group released a reissue of Pop 'til You Drop! titled New Arrival exclusively in markets outside of North America.[26] The album contains seven tracks from Pop 'til You Drop! alongside six new tracks. The album debuted at number four in Sweden and was certified Gold a few weeks after its release.[27] Despite this, sales for New Arrival were lower than expected and the record sold fewer than 350,000 copies worldwide.[28] To promote the release, the band embarked on the New Arrival Tour that March, performing shows in Sweden, Denmark, Russia, and Slovakia.[29][30][31]\n\nThe album was preceded by the European release of \"Floorfiller\". The song served as the album's first single and became a top five hit in their home country.[32] The second single taken from the album was \"A Perfect Match\" which peaked at number two in Sweden.[33] \"Let Your Heart Do All the Talking\" was planned as the third single from New Arrival, but its commercial release was later canceled.[34] In May 2003, the group partnered with the brand Popdrinks for a promotional-only release of the song \"Bounce With Me\" in Sweden.[35]\n\n2004: Greatest Hits and disbandment [ edit ]\n\nIn May 2004, the group released Greatest Hits, a compilation of three new songs and thirteen singles.[36] The album was preceded by the single \"I Promised Myself\", a cover of the Nick Kamen song.[37] The single became another top two hit for the group in Sweden.[38]\n\nFollowing the release of Greatest Hits, the group disbanded; their disbandment was not publicly announced until April 2006.[39]\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nFor a complete list of all the songs, see List of songs recorded by A-Teens\n\nTours [ edit ]\n\nPop 'Til You Drop!
