(Avengers 4 \u2014 the follow-up to Avengers: Infinity War, the end of which would seem to have significant implications for the characters on TV\u2019s S.H.I.E.L.D. \u2014 hits theaters next May.) \u201cWhatever they [at Marvel Studios] have planned, I cannot say,\u201d she hedged.\n\nAs for speculation that Season 6, being S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2018s first-ever shortened run, will serve as the show\u2019s swan song, Dungey told me, \u201cI feel like Season 5 was their creatively strongest yet, so I don\u2019t at the moment have any plans to think of Season 6 as the last season.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the summertime schedule could extend the show\u2019s life span.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve discovered is that we have a very loyal and passionate fan base for S.H.I.E.L.D. The show does incredibly well for us in delayed viewing,\u201d Dungey explained. \u201cBy putting it in the summer, we\u2019re going to be able to \u2018super-serve\u2019 the fan base that loves that show and hopefully give it an opportunity to continue on longer than we would if it was [scheduled] in-season.\u201d\n\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. airs its Season 5 finale this Friday at 9/8c.", "images":
