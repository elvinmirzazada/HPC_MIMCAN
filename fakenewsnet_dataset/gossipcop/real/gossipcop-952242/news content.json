Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\nNeilson starred alongside full-time cast members Caroline Stanbury, Marissa Hermer, Juliet Angus, Caprice Bourret and Noelle Reno for the first season of Ladies of London, which aired in 2014. Julie Montagu and Caroline Fleming joined the cast for season 2. In May 2017, Montagu confirmed the show would not be returning for a fourth season.\n\nIn addition to her time on reality TV, Neilson worked as model and was friendly with fellow models Moss and Naomi Campbell and the late fashion designer Alexander McQueen. She reflected on her relationship with the designer, who died by suicide in 2010, during an interview with the Daily Mail in 2015.\n\n\u201cHe was my brother, my boyfriend, my soulmate. Most of the time people called me Mrs McQueen. Quite often we were sharing a bed,\u201d Neilson said at the time. \u201c\u2018Lee had been through similar pain. He understood me; we understood each other \u2026 The truth is I was happier with Lee than with anyone else. He asked me to marry him towards the end and I said no. I wish now that I had said yes.\u201d\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.

She told MyBaba in 2015 that her inspiration behind the series was partly based on her experience with dyslexia.\n\n\u201cAngry Me is a character based on me in part as a child with severe dyslexia \u2014 but I think Angry Me evokes the frustrations and feelings for children when they can\u2019t release such a powerful emotion as anger and it can be so many different things that a child can struggle with,\u201d Neilson told the outlet at the time. \u201cOther characters have been based around friends, some family, some godchildren.
