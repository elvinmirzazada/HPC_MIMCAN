Kate Middleton was also full of happy news -- welcoming her third child, Prince Louis, in April.\n\nSee what the Duchesses donned in 2018 as we round up the standout looks from each.\n\nHere Comes the Bride\n\nJane Barlow - WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nWe can't kick this list off without talking about Markle's wedding looks. The former actress from L.A. officially became a British royal when she tied the knot with Prince Harry in May at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in Berkshire, England. The bride wore an elegant, bespoke bateau neckline dress, designed by Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy.\n\nChange of Dress\n\nSteve Parsons - WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe newly married Duchess of Sussex swapped her Givenchy number for a second wedding dress for the reception party later in the day. The stunning halter gown by Stella McCartney suited Markle's modern take on classic style perfectly. A version of this covetable look became available in the designer's first bridal collection in November.\n\nBlushing Beauty\n\nDominic Lipinski - Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe newly minted royal looked romantic and feminine in a sheer blush pink dress by Ghost and dome hat by Philip Treacy for Prince Charles' 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration at Buckingham Palace in May.\n\nPretty in Pink\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nMarkle opted for a light pink hue again the following month via an off-the-shoulder Carolina Herrera buttoned dress and matching Philip Treacy hat, similar to the one she wore previously, at the Trooping the Colour -- making the shade her unofficial go-to color.\n\nOut With the Queen\n\nNeil Mockford/GC Images\n\nThe former Suits star had her first royal engagement with Queen Elizabeth in June. She chose Givenchy again for the occasion -- this time, an ivory caped dress, cinched with a thin leather black belt, styled with matching pointed-toe pumps -- when the duo visited Chester, England.\n\nChic in Stripes\n\nKarwai Tang/WireImage\n\nMiddleton and Markle enjoyed a girls' day out at Wimbledon in July. Middleton wore a white polka-dotted dress, while Markle opted for a trouser look via a white wide-leg pant and striped shirt by Ralph Lauren, Altuzarra handbag and Maison Michel fedora.\n\nBright in Yellow\n\nYui Mok - WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe Duchess was simply stylish in a sleek canary yellow midi by Brandon Maxwell while attending the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge reception in London in July. She completed the ensemble with nude pumps and a tight low bun.\n\nDarling in Dior\n\nAnwar Hussein/WireImage\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex was exquisite in a timeless, flawlessly tailored navy blue A-line dress by Dior, featuring her favorite collar-baring bateau neckline at Westminster Abbey to mark the centenary of the Royal Air Force in July. She accessorized with cream-colored pumps and coordinating Stephen Jones fascinator.\n\nSuit Up\n\nSamir Hussein/Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nThe newlyweds visited Dublin, Ireland, in July, and the brunette channeled her inner boss lady in a cropped suit jacket and straight-leg pants from Givenchy and her go-to Sarah Flint leather pumps. The best part? She styled it with a simple white tee underneath.\n\nIn the Trenches\n\nNeil Mockford/GC Images\n\nWe told you she loves blush pink! The royal donned the pale hue again for her visit to the Nelson Mandela Centenary Exhibition at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London in July, rocking a sleeveless trench coat dress by Canadian designer Nonie, finished off with a rose-nude Mulberry bag and Dior pumps.\n\nHello, Legs!\n\nDan Charity - WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nMarkle showed off her toned bare legs in a black, double-breasted tux LBD by Judith & Charles for a gala performance of Hamilton in London in August.\n\nPregnancy Glow\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nThe mom-to-be, who announced her pregnancy upon embarking on a 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Tonga and Fiji in October with Prince Harry, was glowing in the Aussie sunshine. The expectant Duchess wore a striped tied linen dress with a flirty thigh-high slit by Reformation and Sarah Flint brown leather sandals.\n\nIsland Fever\n\nSamir Hussein/Samir Hussein / WireImage\n\nThe Duchess dressed for tropical weather in a red-and-blue printed Figue maxi with playful pom-pom details during a morning tea reception in Suva, Fiji.\n\nA Vision in White\n\nPaul Edwards - Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe couple arrived at a state dinner in Nuku'alofa, Tonga, as Markle stunned in a white custom Theia column gown that hugged her growing baby bump, while Prince Harry looked dapper in a classic black suit and bowtie.\n\nSeeing Blue\n\nIan Vogler - Pool/Getty Images\n\nPool/Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nThe Duchess was especially beautiful in blue during the tour. She took our breath away in a caped gown by SAFiYAA at the state dinner in Suva, Fiji, and in a Veronica Beard shirt dress in Nuku'alofa, Tonga.\n\nBirds of Paradise\n\nPool/Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nMarkle's fashion took flight thanks to her dreamy Oscar de la Renta tulle dress with bird motifs. All eyes were on the Duchess as she attended the Australian Geographic Society Awards in Sydney.\n\nBundled Up in Sweden\n\nChris Jackson - Pool/Getty Images\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton, who was pregnant with her third child, Prince Louis, at the time, started the year with a trip to Sweden and Norway in January and February. The Duchess of Cambridge looked ready for cold weather as she walked with her husband and Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel, wearing a long buttoned forest green coat with furry black cuffs and collar, topped off with a matching hat.\n\nPrincess Diana Vibes\n\nKarwai Tang/WireImage\n\nMiddleton sported a red houndstooth print double-breasted coat from Catherine Walker while visiting the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden. The bright piece resembled her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana's, Moschino jacket, which she wore in 1990.\n\nA Royal Angel\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe brunette radiated in an angelic, cream-colored pleated cape gown with embellished neckline by her go-to designer, Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen, as she was escorted to a dinner by King Harald V at Norway's Royal Palace in Oslo.\n\nRed Carpet Princess\n\nWPA Pool/Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nThe Duchess wowed in dark green again at the British Academy Film Awards, two months before giving birth. She arrived in a V-neck, empire-waist dress by Jenny Packham, adorned with glittering emerald jewelry at the Royal Albert Hall in London.\n\nMint Green Mum\n\nWireImage\n\nMiddleton was all smiles as she headed to the Royal Society of Medicine in London, showing off her growing belly in an adorable mint green bow coat and matching dress by Jenny Packham and Jimmy Choo nude suede pumps, one month before the arrival of Prince Louis.\n\nMom of Three\n\nJack Taylor/Getty Images\n\nThe 36-year-old royal and Prince William welcomed their baby boy on April 23. The now-mother of three waved to the crowd outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in London, donning a red dress with lace Peter Pan collar -- another creation by Jenny Packham.\n\nWedding Guest\n\nAndrew Matthews - WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge was gorgeous in a pale yellow (at first glance, it looks white!) Alexander McQueen coat dress and matching floral hat by Philip Treacy at Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding in May.\n\nSummer Style\n\nKarwai Tang/WireImage\n\nIn July, Middleton turned heads in a vibrant yellow Dolce & Gabbana frock (similar to Markle's Brandon Maxwell number), complete with romantic fluttery cap sleeves, to watch the Wimbledon matches in London.\n\nRe-Wear Realness\n\nMax Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images\n\nNever one to shy away from re-wearing her designer duds, the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out in the same long-sleeve lilac Emilia Wickstead dress she wore in July 2017 while attending the Global Ministerial Mental Health Summit in London in October.\n\nChecked Out\n\nSamir Hussein/Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nFor the opening of the V&A Photography Centre at the Victoria & Albert Museum in October, Middleton was super chic in a gray plaid tweed dress with asymmetric neckline by Erdem, finished off with matching maroon belt, Jimmy Choo velvet pumps and clutch.\n\nFierce in Fuchsia\n\nMax Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images\n\nIt was the year of royal weddings! Her Royal Highness donned a fuchsia pink Alexander McQueen knee-length dress, featuring puffed shoulders and a gathered skirt, and a matching veiled Philip Treacy hat for Princess Eugenie's nuptials in October.\n\nCinderella IRL\n\nJohn Stillwell - WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe Duchess looked like a fairy tale princess in an icy blue ruched Alexander McQueen gown, further elevated by the Lover's Knot pearl tiara -- the exact one Princess Diana wore -- with teardrop earrings and a pearl and diamond necklace at a state dinner in Buckingham Palace in October.\n\nShe Recycles Again!\n\nMark Cuthbert/UK Press via Getty Images\n\nThe Duchess of shopping her closet re-wore a turquoise blue, pleated, square-neck dress by Emilia Wickstead in November on her way to the BBC with Prince William to raise awareness about cyberbullying. She previously wore the frock with a matching hat during her 2014 Australia and New Zealand royal tour.\n\nMatching in Burgundy\n\nGC Images\n\nWireImage\n\nThe royal sisters-in-law coincidentally both chose burgundy on the same day in November! Middleton visited the UCL Developmental Neuroscience Lab in a Paule Ka skirt suit with a black turtleneck sweater and ribbon in her hair.
