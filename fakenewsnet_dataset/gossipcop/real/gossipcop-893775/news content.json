Guys are jackasses \u2014 we will buy them mansions and houses...all because of sex.\"\n\nHoda and Kathie Lee asked him to explain that notion.\n\n\"Here's the reality,'' he told them. \"I am aware of the rules. I didn't create them, so you can try this yourself. I'm not saying life is fair. What I'm saying is the male of the species is visually stimulated.\n\n\"That's life, and so you have power, the power of being a female, and you can access that power to make more money.\"\n\nSimmons, 68, writes in his new book, \"On Power,\" that the best route to influence for women is using their appearance, which Hoda and Kathie Lee disputed.\n\nClosed Captioning ON OFF apply | reset x Text Display\n\nBackground\n\nEnhancements font\n\nTimes New Roman Arial Comic Sans\n\nT T T T size\n\n\n\ncolor share link Gene Simmons of KISS talks about new box set of unreleased songs Play Video - 3:02 Gene Simmons of KISS talks about new box set of unreleased songs Play Video - 3:02\n\n\"What I'm pointing out is your looks, how you dress, how you present yourself is an outreach, an extension of the power you have,'' he said. \"We can't do that. Men can't do that. We have to build skyscrapers and thereby try be more attractive to you.\n\n\"Your actual female self is your power, so you have a choice of implementing that power, that's up to you.\"\n\nSimmons also told the New York Post that women need to \"get over your biological urges\" and choose between having a family and a career because trying to do both is too difficult.\n\nThe KISS guitarist also gave his take on the allegations of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment against prominent figures like Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.\n\nClosed Captioning ON OFF apply | reset x Text Display\n\nBackground\n\nEnhancements font\n\nTimes New Roman Arial Comic Sans\n\nT T T T size\n\n\n\ncolor share link KISS controversy: Can Gene Simmons trademark a hand gesture?

It's time for women to stand up, take charge.
