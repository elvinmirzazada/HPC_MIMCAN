The children of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge played their pageboy and bridesmaid roles perfectly, photographed at the entrance to St Mark\u2019s church in Englefield, Berkshire. In total there were eight children in Pippa\u2019s bridal party and the sweet group complimented the bride\u2019s stunning Giles Deacon dress beautifully, dressed in their cute cream outfits. Accompanying Prince George, three, and Charlotte, two, were fellow flower girls Countess Philippa Hoyos, Lily French and Avia Horner. The pageboys were Casimir Tatos, Edward Sebire William and Ward, who along with Prince George, made a very smart group.\n\nClick here to view gallery\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Getty Images\n\nNewlyweds Pippa Middleton and James Matthews with their young bridal party\n\nThe bridesmaids and pageboys outfits were bespoke commissions by Pepa & Co. The girls' cream dresses featured pretty collars and puffed sleeves, and the youngsters wore gorgeous flower garlands in their hair. The boys wore cream tops and gold breeches. The happy party looked to be enjoying the occasion, tottering around at the front of the church with their confetti baskets in hand. Duchess Kate did a wonderful job keeping the little ones in line as they waited patiently. One photograph showed Kate crouching down to chat to her children George and Charlotte, while an older page boy was said to have larked around a little. One guest was later seen telling guests that she had picked up Charlotte\u2019s heart shaped floral garland, which she had mislaid.\n\nREAD: Newlyweds Pippa Middleton and James Matthews celebrate with a kiss\n\nDuchess Kate helps the bridesmaids and pageboys at the wedding\n\nThe royal family traditionally have a large bridal party of young bridesmaids and pageboys at weddings. When Duchess Kate married Prince William in 2011, Kate was joined by a charming group of four bridesmaids and two pageboys. The Duchess\u2019s bridesmaids, like Pippa\u2019s, also wore pretty flower crowns on their heads for the wedding ceremony. Although not a royal wedding, Pippa seems to be following in her sister\u2019s footsteps. All the children in the bridal party behaved beautifully at the wedding of Pippa and James, all be it with a gentle \u2018shhh\u2019 signal from Kate as they entered the church. The Duchess was photographed placing her finger on her mouth to show the young bridal party it was time to quieten down.\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Rex\n\nPrincess Charlotte and Prince George with their mother Kate\n\nThe Duchess had previously expressed concern about her children George and Charlotte, who had starring roles on the big day. At the Queen's garden party earlier this week, Kate told one guest that she was \"a bit worried\" about how they would behave at the ceremony. Partygoer Andrew Bates said: \"[Kate] said that they were all really looking forward to her sister's wedding at the weekend but she was a bit worried about how her children might behave. She said she was hopeful that they would be good but you never know at that age.\" For all the best photos and coverage of Pippa's big day, stay tuned to hellomagazine.com and pick up the souvenir edition of HELLO! magazine out on Monday.", "images": ["https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/bb531becac40-royals-sporting-events-photos.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/6d2d3f81247f-george-charlotte-louis-lambrook.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/e058f15bb1a7-prince-george-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9c618110537d-gettyimages-1243027415.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aadd691a9ac6-pippa-a.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d47541a6ca08-gettyimages-1245816721-2.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5f7a06383b5f-royals-sporting-events-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/bfc5eb7969c9-gettyimages-1401932624.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/399979f0abb3-kate-middleton-family-nieces-and-nephews.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a8d1222e70d8-kate-middleton-z.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/65bcd053cace-william-kate-george-charlotte.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2c9f11209389-sophiehamilton.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/e058f15bb1a7-prince-george-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sophie Hamilton", "Parenting Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2017052039113/prince-george-princess-charlotte-children-bridal-party-whos-who/", "title": "Who\u2019s who in Pippa Middleton's young bridal party", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "title": "Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Pippa\u2019s bridal party of bridesmaids and pageboys | HELLO!", "description": "Pippa Middleton was given a helping hand on her wedding day by an adorable group of bridesmaids and pageboys, including Prince George and Princess Charlotte who played their roles perfectly", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "plantilla": "Plantilla de noticias (plantilla-noticias.html)", "og": {"url": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2017052039113/prince-george-princess-charlotte-children-bridal-party-whos-who/", "title": "Who\u2019s who in Pippa Middleton's young bridal party", "description": "Your guide to newlyweds Pippa and James\u2019 bridesmaids and pageboys", "updated_time": "2017-05-20T16:53:01.000Z", "article": {"author": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/author/sophie-hamilton/"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/e058f15bb1a7-prince-george-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "height": 675, "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "video": "https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/ELVCcLzu-1280.mp4", "site_name": "HELLO!"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2017-05-20T16:53:01.000Z", "published_time": "2017-05-20T16:53:01.000Z", "section": "Royalty", "tag": "Video Article,Princess Charlotte,Prince William,Prince George,Pippa Middleton,Kate Middleton, The Princess of Wales,James Matthews,Royalty", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/hello/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 115281558857295, "pages": 89982930077, "admins": 89982930077}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@hellomag", "title": "Who\u2019s who in Pippa Middleton's young bridal party", "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/e058f15bb1a7-prince-george-t.jpg?tx=c_fill%2Cw_1200", "description": "Your guide to newlyweds Pippa and James\u2019 bridesmaids and pageboys", "creator": "@hellomag", "url": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2017052039113/prince-george-princess-charlotte-children-bridal-party-whos-who/"}, "next-head-count": 37, "msapplication-TileColor": "#cc0000", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495299181.0, "source": "https://us.hellomagazine.com", "summary": ""}
