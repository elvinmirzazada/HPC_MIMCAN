{"url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-bekah-martinez-introduces-new-boyfriend/", "text": "The Bachelor\u2018s Bekah Martinez has a new boyfriend \u2014 and they just became Instagram official!\n\nOn Monday, Martinez, 23, officially shut down speculation that she might appear on the upcoming season of Bachelor in Paradise by posting a flirty photo with her new man on Instagram.\n\nIn the shot, Martinez wraps her arms around Grayston Leonard.\n\n\u201cMy own private paradise,\u201d she captioned the photo.\n\nLeonard, 29, also shared the photo on his own account. He joked that Martinez finally allowed him to post a photo of her.\n\n\u201c@whats_ur_sign has finally lifted the restrictions on my Instagram. The training wheels are off and this lil boy gets to run wild and share my love and affection publicly. This is my lady and I\u2019m proud of it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLeonard is the founder of the rock climbing gym Long Beach Rising, set to open next year.\n\nMartinez, who appeared on Arie Luyendyk\u2018s season of The Bachelor, opened up about her new relationship in an interview with PureWow.\n\n\u201cAt first we decided to take our relationship slow because I didn\u2019t know if I was going to go on Paradise or not and I wasn\u2019t really sure what I wanted. I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to miss out on that opportunity,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut as it got closer to [filming] I just started realizing that it wasn\u2019t worth it for me to put myself in that environment where I could possibly jeopardize what I had with Grayston.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI just decided that the guy that I was with back home was the person that I wanted to be with right now. It was kinda this realization that if I have something right in front of me that\u2019s good, why am I going to go out of my way to look for something else?\u201d\n\nMartinez said she met Leonard at a local rock climbing gym, and after hanging out a few times as friends, their relationship started getting more serious.\n\n\u201cAt first, it was really casual and we were just doing a lot of fun stuff together, and then it just progressed into something deeper,\u201d she said. \u201cGrayston has a curiosity about the world and zest for life. And that\u2019s what\u2019s really important to me. He\u2019s just totally himself and doesn\u2019t give a sh*t about what anybody else thinks, and I really like that about him.\u201d\n\nSeason 5 of Bachelor in Paradise premieres Aug. 7 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.", "images":
