While the 40-year-old actress and Honest Company founder is well-known for her flawless, dewy and blemish-free complexion, she has her share of skin concerns, just like the rest of us.\n\n\u201cOne of them is my dry, flaky skin I can get quite rashy and I have pretty sensitive skin. So I try to avoid anything that will give me that eczema-type rash. And then the other thing is congestion\u2014having underground clogged pores and blackheads.\u201d[1]\n\nDealing with such tricky skin over the years was a key reason why she turned to clean beauty. \u201cAll of the skincare products that I use are clean, and why I\u2019m so passionate about it is because I\u2019ve had such reactive skin literally since I was born. I thought I had chronic cystic acne when I was in my twenties, but what I realized is I\u2019m just allergic to a lot of petroleum-based ingredients, and I\u2019m also allergic to synthetic fragrances.\u201d[2][3]\n\nNow, Jessica\u2019s skincare routine consists of mostly her own Honest Beauty products. (\u201cIt\u2019s the only way that I can ensure that I\u2019m not going to have some kind of reaction.\"[4]) She also swears by an array of skin gadgets, face masks and treatments with her esthetician (and BFF) Shani Darden.\n\nReady to see which products keep Jessica\u2019s complexion calm, clear and glowing? Read on.\n\nJessica Alba\u2019s Skincare Routine (At a Glance)\n\nHer Morning Skincare Routine\n\nHer Nighttime Skincare Routine\n\nHer Skincare Treatments\n\nFacials @jessicaalba Shani Darden: \u201cWhen I became a mom and I stopped acting full-time... they say that your daughters take your beauty away from you. Well, they did! So I cried a lot and I became best friends with my esthetician, \u2018cause I basically saw her every other day. Anytime I leave, it\u2019s weird, with her I look better. Because you know how sometimes you get facials, you look a little busted after? Go to Shani, you look better. She was the first facialist that actually made me look better right after my appointment. You usually look crazy after a facial, and need three days for your skin to calm down. That doesn\u2019t happen with Shani.\u201d\n\nTraci Martyn: \u201cWhen I\u2019m in New York, I\u2019ll see Tracie Martyn for facials. She uses this zappy electric current thing that makes my skin feel really tight after. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nDermatologist\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have a regular dermatologist. I probably should! I feel like I really should. I am not afraid to use a skin tightening laser. Bring it! I am not afraid to use an IPL. Bring it!\u201d\n\nHer Diet, Exercise and Lifestyle\n\nNutritionist @bewellbykelly Kelly LeVeque: \u201cMy go-to nutritional guru is Kelly LeVeque, so I always turn to her for advice.\u201d\n\nDiet\n\n\u201cI really think [clear skin] has to do with nutrition. Staying away from refined sugars as much as you can, and carbohydrates\u2014going for more complex carbohydrates. Having a balanced diet, having as much fresh produce as possible. Not as much processed food. And really eliminating fried foods.\u201d\n\nHydration\n\n\u201cI drink coconut water and I drink a ton of water. It\u2019s not just putting hydration on the [outside], it\u2019s also about the health of your skin inside. I think staying hydrated is really important... for glowing skin and high energy. [Dehydration] shows on the outside. As you get older, you really see it on your face.\u201d\n\nSupplements\n\n\u201cDefinitely consult your doctor, but I do think taking a high-quality DHA is really helpful, and I am an advocate for probiotics and having a good multivitamin on hand. I also love prenatals. They\u2019re packed with all kinds of vitamins to help grow a baby, and any time I\u2019ve taken them, whether I was pregnant or not or trying to get pregnant or not, I\u2019ve found that everything just looks more glowy and vibrant. I also like to put collagen in my coffee in the morning, or I\u2019ll use a protein powder with collagen if I\u2019m making a smoothie. I take a hyaluronic acid supplement as well.\u201d\n\nSleep\n\n\u201cSleeping and eating right is more important than you think. I didn\u2019t sleep at all in my 20s. I worked so much. I [still] don't sleep as much as I\u2019d like, but I don\u2019t know if anybody does. I really want eight hours of sleep at night, but I just don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nExercise @jessicaalba \u201c[After] breakfast... I do try to do some movement, whether it\u2019s yoga or spinning. We converted our garage to a gym, and there\u2019s a bunch of workout apps.\u201d Meditation @jessicaalba Headspace: \u201cI like to listen to meditations. I did TM [transcendental meditation] but I find it\u2019s kind of tough to meditate on your own\u2014for me\u2014so I like Headspace. And you can do five-minute meditations, 10-minute mediations\u2026 and you can go to whatever it is you\u2019re dealing with. It\u2019s pretty dope.\u201d\n\nAttitude\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve really grown to love who I\u2019ve become and who I\u2019ve turned into. I don\u2019t have the same fullness in my face that I had when I was younger, but I\u2019m okay with having more angles. I\u2019m okay with waking up and seeing this person that I am today because it represents the comfort and the confidence and the life experience that comes with aging\u2014there\u2019s just an ease now. When I was younger, I was always in my head, and I was so insecure. I was worried about such silly things that, at the end of the day, mean absolutely nothing. I wasn\u2019t living in the moment. I didn\u2019t have the same quality of life when I was younger as I do now. I had more collagen and fluffier cheeks and no pores, and my cellulite wasn\u2019t as dominant\u2026 I didn\u2019t have stretch marks on my boobs, and yet I was still so insecure about every little thing, you know? I never just enjoyed and lived in the moment, and now, it\u2019s just like whatever! Let me live!\u201d\n\nSources: [1] \u2022 [2] \u2022 [3] \u2022 [4] \u2022 [5] \u2022 [6] \u2022 [7] \u2022 [8] \u2022 [9] \u2022 [10] \u2022 [11] \u2022 [12] \u2022 [13] \u2022 [14] \u2022 [15] \u2022 [16]\n\nIf you buy something through our links, we may earn a commission.
