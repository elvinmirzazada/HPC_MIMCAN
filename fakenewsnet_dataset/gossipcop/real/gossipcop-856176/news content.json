If you don\u2019t, grab one anyway\u2014because this is the most exciting thing you\u2019re going to read all day. It turns out the movie Twitter dreamt up about Rihanna and Lupita Nyong\u2019o playing a pair of genius scammers is actually coming to life.\n\nEntertainment Weekly reported Monday that Netflix has secured a deal for the concept at the Cannes Film Festival after a \u201cdramatic negotiation session.\u201d Rihanna and Nyong\u2019o will star, Ava DuVernay will reportedly direct, and Issa Rae will write the script.

form.\n\nDuVernay also seemed to confirm the news on Twitter, tweeting, \u201cWe deserve nice things,\u201d and sharing a link to the movie news on Twitter Moments.\n\nX content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe prospective movie was inspired by a photo of Rihanna and Nyong\u2019o side by side at a Miu Miu fashion show in 2014.", "images":
