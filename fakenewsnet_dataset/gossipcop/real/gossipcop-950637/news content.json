She would congratulate the singer on his singles reaching the top of the charts, excitedly talk about going to his shows and retweet his musings on naps or cereal.\n\nHowever, it was a post supporting \u201cJelena\u201d that really caught the attention of fans. In a reply to a now-deleted tweet sent out in 2012, Baldwin appears to defend the pop star\u2019s then-relationship with Gomez.\n\n\u201cShe is beyond flawless and he\u2019s ya know he\u2019s Bieber,\u201d Baldwin wrote. \u201cThey are the perfect relationship.. -___- forever alone.\u201d\n\nShe also reportedly wrote in a since-deleted tweet screengrabbed by Elle and other outlets, \u201cI don\u2019t care what anyone says but Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez together is the definition of a teenage dream.\u201d\n\nBaldwin\u2019s tweets also hint to the couple\u2019s shared religious beliefs. She retweeted a Bible verse that Bieber shared in Dec. 2012 and also said it was \u201creally cool of u to [publicly] thank God and Jesus in ur speech!\u201d back in Aug. 2011.\n\nThere was also some room for flirting.\n\n\u201cCan we just talk about your dark hair for a second\u2026\u201d Baldwin tweeted in Jan. 2012, adding the hashtag \u201c#itlooksreallygood.\u201d\n\nBaldwin most recently shared a tweet of Bieber\u2019s in Sept. 2015, when the \u201cSorry\u201d singer wrote, \u201cLive love and laugh. Thanks.\u201d Stephen Baldwin\u2019s daughter shared the post with her own comment: \u201cgenuinely this is cheesy.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cLove Yourself\u201d singer officially announced that he plans to marry model Baldwin with a loving tribute to her on his Instagram Monday.\n\n\u201cWas gonna wait a while to say anything but word travels fast, listen plain and simple Hailey I am soooo in love with everything about you!\u201d Bieber wrote in the caption.\n\n\u201cSo committed to spending my life getting to know every single part of you loving you patiently and kindLY,\u201d he continued. \u201cI promise to lead our family with honor and integrity letting Jesus through his Holy Spirit guide us in everything we do and every decision we make.\u201d\n\nThe model tweeted minutes after her fianc\u00e9\u2019s post, writing, \u201cNot sure what I did in life to deserve such happiness but I am so utterly grateful to God for giving me such an incredible person to share my life with! No words could ever express my gratitude.\u201d\n\nSplash News\n\nIn the past few weeks since reigniting their romance, Bieber and Baldwin have been showing PDA all over the Big Apple. In early July, they were seen locking lips during a stroll through a local Brooklyn garden after grabbing lunch at DUMBO House, according to an onlooker. Bieber was also pictured giving Baldwin a sweet smooch on the forehead.\n\n\u201cRight now, Justin is very happy with Hailey,\u201d a source recently told PEOPLE. \u201cHe always had a lot of love for her.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin Hit Washington State for Church and a Hot Tub Session\n\nBieber and Baldwin previously dated before, splitting in 2016.\n\nAfter calling it quits, \u201cwe went through a long period of time when we weren\u2019t friends,\u201d Baldwin recently told U.K. newspaper The Times.\n\nThat same year, Bieber told GQ that he didn\u2019t want to \u201crush into anything\u201d in case the pair ended up getting married someday.\n\n\u201cWhat if Hailey ends up being the girl I\u2019m gonna marry, right? If I rush into anything, if I damage her, then it\u2019s always gonna be damaged. It\u2019s really hard to fix wounds like that. It\u2019s so hard \u2026 I just don\u2019t want to hurt her,\u201d he told the magazine.\n\nA source told PEOPLE that Bieber \u201cknew a couple of weeks ago that he wanted to propose\u201d to Baldwin. The source added, \u201cHe sees marriage as something very special. He would never propose if he wasn\u2019t crazy about Hailey.\u201d", "images":
