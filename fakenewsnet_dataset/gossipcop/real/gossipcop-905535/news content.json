You were all so wonderful. My extended family (half of Beirut) loved it too. Thank you and have a great run. Love, George and Amal.\u201d\n\nThe sweet gesture was very much appreciated.\n\n\"This is better than fairy dust!\" Bethan wrote. \"A letter and flowers from George and Amal Clooney!

George's Casamigos co-founder, Rande Gerber, also revealed last month that the actor once gave 14 of his friends $1 million each as a surprise gift, and paid their taxes for the year.\n\nHear the incredible story below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2016-04/1280_george_clooney_amal_clooney_GettyImages473029800.jpg?width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fet_102217_ClooneyOnKids720.png%3Fh%3D9db51067&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Fcindy.jpg%3Fh%3D33dcb2d9&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-10%2Fgeorge_clooney_amal_clooney_gettyimages_865229430.jpg%3Fh%3D6abb419f&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/george_clooney_amal_clooney_gettyimages_865229430.jpg?h=6abb419f", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fbrightcove%2Fvideos%2Fimages%2Fposters%2Famalcloons.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/george_clooney_amal_clooney_gettyimages_865229430.jpg?h=6abb419f", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/george-and-amal-clooney-send-sweetest-note-after-theater-date-night-93996", "title": "George and Amal Clooney Send the Sweetest Note After Theater Date Night", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/george_clooney_amal_clooney_gettyimages_865229430.jpg?h=6abb419f", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "George and Amal Clooney are nothing if not thoughtful!", "title": "George and Amal Clooney Send the Sweetest Note After Theater Date Night", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/george-and-amal-clooney-send-sweetest-note-after-theater-date-night-93996", "type": "Article"}, "description": "George and Amal Clooney are nothing if not thoughtful!", "twitter": {"description": "George and Amal Clooney are nothing if not thoughtful!", "title": "George and Amal Clooney Send the Sweetest Note After Theater Date Night", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/george-and-amal-clooney-send-sweetest-note-after-theater-date-night-93996", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/george_clooney_amal_clooney_gettyimages_865229430.jpg?h=6abb419f", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "George and Amal Clooney Send the Sweetest Note After Theater Date Night | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , George Clooney, Amal Clooney", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 44, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
