Relive the Real Housewives' biggest fights ever \u2014 including Teresa Giudice flipping the dinner table and Kyle Richards calling out her sister Kim for being an alcoholic\n\n\u201cWell, I mean, I\u2019ve worn wigs long before I ever met NeNe. I love wigs,\u201d the Don\u2019t Be Tardy star, 40, tells Us. \u201cMy mom\u2019s a hairdresser. I just love hair. I have great hair. I just love to like, play around with different hair and different styles, and I\u2019d rather fry the s\u2014t out of a wig than my own hair. \u2026 I\u2019ve been wearing wigs for 17 years.

It\u2019s like, I actually \u2026 I\u2019m a trendsetter. I feel like, versus you guys mocking me like, her wig, and calling me wig is, I mean, that\u2019s kind of funny in itself, but \u2026 yeah I mean, in essence, I guess it kind of is.\u201d\n\nZolciak also clarified that her lyric \u201cThirsty peachy, peachy / just can\u2019t help it / you\u2019re obsessed\u201c is not about Leakes, but haters in general.\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019m very comfortable with who I am. It\u2019s for all the haters,\u201d Zolciak tells Us. \u201cAnd obviously, yes, Atlanta, Georgia is a peach, but it\u2019s not directed towards anybody, in particular. It\u2019s more along the lines of just whoever the haters \u2026 to all of them. You thirsty peachy peaches.
