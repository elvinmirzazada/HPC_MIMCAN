Leah Remini, who starred alongside James for nine seasons of \u201cThe King of Queens,\u201d has since joined the full-time cast.\n\nThe decision to have Donna, played by Erinn Hayes, die on the show stunned fans, but James says the character\u2019s death was not a reflection of Hayes\u2019 talent or a chemistry issue \u2014 but a way to open up new plot possibilities.\n\n\u201cI get that people are like \u2018Whoa, why would you do this?\u2019 But it really felt like a thing like this was needed for this show to drive forward,\u201d James said.\n\n\u201cNow, I have to deal with my daughter in a different way, and she\u2019s gonna go to college, or one\u2019s getting married, or the holidays. And it deals with things in a different, weightier way.\u201d\n\nJames, 52, explained he was originally supposed to star as a single father on the show but he and the producers ultimately decided to give him a wife along with three kids.\n\nThe show\u2019s makers, however, realized a change was needed after the first season if the series was going to have a lengthy life.\n\nLeah Remini joined the show at the end of Season 1.\n\n\u201cThe plot of the show didn\u2019t have enough drive,\u201d James said. \u201cIf we got through a second season, I wouldn\u2019t see us getting through a third one. We were literally just running out of ideas.\u201d\n\nJames said he\u2019s unsure if the show will address Donna\u2019s death further, considering it\u2019s meant to be a lighthearted sitcom. So far, the series has mostly sidestepped her absence. In the first episode, James\u2019 character received a letter from her gym saying they\u2019ve missed her.\n\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d he says.\n\nThe second season has already brought other major changes. Remini\u2019s full-time role on the show as Vanessa Cellucci \u2014 James\u2019 former partner on the police force \u2014 comes after she made a well-received guest appearance on the two-part Season 1 finale.\n\n\u201cWhen she came on \u2026 it was just the greatest,\u201d James said. \u201cFans loved it, everybody on the crew loved it. We just knew right away, so we thought, \u2018How can we get her here full-time to be on the show?'\u201d\n\nFor Remini, it was a dream come true to work with James again after appearing together in over 200 episodes of \u201cThe King of Queens\u201d from 1998 to 2007.\n\nThe 52-year-old said he was originally supposed to star as a single father on the show, but he and the producers ultimately decided to give his character a wife.\n\n\u201cIt could\u2019ve been next year, 10 years from now. It could\u2019ve been 10 years earlier. I would\u2019ve taken any opportunity to work with Kevin again,\u201d Remini said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with other leading men after Kevin, but there\u2019s something very special that you just can\u2019t kind of explain when something works with somebody.\u201d\n\nThe first few episodes of season two focus on the friendship of their characters, who come to run a small security firm together called Monkey Fist.\n\n\u201cThese were ex-partners,\u201d Remini says of her and James\u2019 characters. \u201cThey worked together, and we haven\u2019t even begun to go into the back story of that in exploring what their relationship was other than a few sentences here and there.\u201d\n\nRemini \u2014 who relocated from Los Angeles to the East Coast for the show\u2019s filming on Long Island \u2014 said it didn\u2019t take any time whatsoever for her and James to recapture the rapport showcased on \u201cThe King of Queens.\u201d Just like old times, they trade witty one-liners and sarcasm as Remini\u2019s character gets frustrated by James\u2019 character\u2019s antics.\n\nRemini, 47, and James say they both are playing characters with personalities that mirror their own \u2014 and fans love it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily they relate to the characters, it\u2019s they relate to the people who we are in a way,\u201d James said. \u201cWhich is great to me.\u201d\n\nJames and Remini starred with Jerry Stiller (l.) in \u201cThe King of Queens\u201d from 1998 to 2007.\n\nNeither James nor Remini is ruling out eventually exploring a romantic plotline for their characters.\n\n\u201cYou have to at some point,\u201d Remini said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a \u2018no,\u2019 it\u2019s just there\u2019s so many episodes to do before that.\u201d\n\nWhatever happens, they\u2019re thrilled to be sharing a studio again.\n\n\u201cIt brings back so many amazing memories,\u201d Remini said. \u201cAnd now, we\u2019re creating new ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cKevin Can Wait\u201d airs Mondays on CBS.", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/10/14/7PXU7A7X54BU3DVUNEXXKSPAPU.jpg?w=1024&h=670"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/10/14/7PXU7A7X54BU3DVUNEXXKSPAPU.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sblendorio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/10/14/kevin-james-explains-why-he-killed-off-kevin-can-wait-wife-and-brought-on-former-tv-wife-leah-remini/", "title": "Kevin James explains why he killed off \u2018Kevin Can Wait\u2019 wife and brought on former TV wife Leah Remini", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Kevin James says the decision was not a reflection of Erinn Hayes' talent or a chemistry issue.", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kevin James explains why he killed off \u2018Kevin Can Wait\u2019 wife and brought on former TV wife Leah Remini", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/10/14/kevin-james-explains-why-he-killed-off-kevin-can-wait-wife-and-brought-on-former-tv-wife-leah-remini/", "description": "Kevin James\u2019 sitcom \u201cKevin Can Wait\u201d killed off a major character to give life to new storylines.
