Just chilling there for the whole thing and you guys have been loud, you\u2019re singing and she\u2019s just kinda like \u2026 I love babies!\u201d\n\nHe dedicated his song \u201cDive\u201d to Cooper, asking the audience to sing along for her.\n\n\u201cI want you to be as loud as you can,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201c\u2018Cause she\u2019s gonna be chill.\u201d\n\nRocky later posted the video to his Facebook account and wrote, \u201cEd Sheeran we didn\u2019t get a picture with you tonight, but you singing to my daughter was pretty amazing. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow!\u201d\n\nSheeran has a concert scheduled Thursday in Orlando, Florida.\n\nRocky, who owns a karaoke company, told The Miami Herald his daughter believes Sheeran is singing her father\u2019s songs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a singer and I sing only Ed Sheeran to her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe hears it on the radio when I\u2019m not around and she\u2019s looking for daddy. She\u2019s been listening to him since before she was born. We had speakers that we could attach to my wife\u2019s stomach where I would play his songs for her.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/benji-madden-cameron-diaz.jpg?crop=0px%2C479px%2C2000px%2C1337px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C802.85714285714px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-834006908.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/kanye-west2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C660px%2C441.57142857143px&resize=420%2C281", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/taylor-3.jpg?crop=2px%2C81px%2C1800px%2C1204px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/kim-kardashian-taylor-swift.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C802.85714285714px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/ashlee-simpson-evan-ross.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C2000px%2C1337px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/prince-favorite-color-not-purple.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-31-at-11-43-29-am.png?crop=66px%2C0px%2C673px%2C450.26904761905px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/chrissy-teigen1.jpg?crop=0px%2C50px%2C859px%2C575px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/miley-cyrus11.jpg?crop=3px%2C0px%2C1994px%2C1334.080952381px&resize=420%2C281"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-834006908.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexia Fernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551/http://people.com/music/ed-sheeran-dedicates-song-baby-named-sheeran/", "title": "Ed Sheeran Dedicates Song to Baby Girl Named After Him: \u2018I Love Babies!\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1143086910", "description": "Ed Sheeran dedicated \"Dive\" to a baby girl named Cooper Sheeran Smith", "keywords": "ed sheeran, news, music news, ed sheeran dedicates song to baby girls named after him, ed sheeran news", "news_keywords": "ed sheeran, news, music news, ed sheeran dedicates song to baby girls named after him, ed sheeran news", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ed Sheeran Dedicates Song to Baby Girl Named After Him: \u2018I Love Babies!\u2019", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551/http://people.com/music/ed-sheeran-dedicates-song-baby-named-sheeran/", "description": "Ed Sheeran dedicated \u201cDive\u201d to a baby girl named Cooper Sheeran Smith", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170901030551im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/gettyimages-834006908.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-31T23:59:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-31T23:59:25+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@people", "creator": "@people"}, "application-name": "PEOPLE.com", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://people.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/a39c9d87d3ee529a684f7a5b3b557adc?s=16"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504223965.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
