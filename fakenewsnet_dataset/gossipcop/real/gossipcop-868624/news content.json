Today the court REJECTED the Kardashian family\u2019s request to strike Chyna\u2019s entire lawsuit. Most importantly, all of Chyna\u2019s legal claims stay in. Chyna will therefore be permitted to have her day in court.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the Kardashians' lawyer shared with ET: \"The Bloom Firm\u2019s tweet is not an accurate statement of what happened in court today. In fact, the Kardashians have successfully chipped away at Ms. White\u2019s outlandish claims since her lawsuit was filed, culminating in today\u2019s hearing \u2014a hearing at which the Court invited counsel for the Kardashians to seek attorney fees against the Bloom Firm for their failure to support Ms. White\u2019s spurious allegations with actual evidence.\"\n\nICYMI, Chyna is seeking unspecified damages following a much-publicized July 2017 incident in which Rob posted nude pictures of her on social media. She also accuses Rob of verbal and physical abuse and blames the entire family for sabotaging what was supposed to be a second season of the E! series Rob and Chyna.\n\nLast month, Rob filed to reduce child support payments to Chyna for their daughter, Dream Kardashian, 2, due to lost income, which prompted Bloom to lash out, telling Page Six he has \"deliberately retreated from social media to reduce his income so that he can pay less child support.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor little rich boy. What kind of father doesn\u2019t want to support his own baby?\u201d she asked rhetorically. \u201cRob and Kris Jenner have also been dodging their depositions. They can run, but they can\u2019t hide. Like all other litigants and witnesses, eventually, they will have to show up and answer questions about where all of Rob\u2019s money has gone. We\u2019ll get a court order requiring them to come to my office and answer questions under oath if necessary.\u201d\n\nThe child support modification request is apparently due to be heard in court in December.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/07/robyn-dixon-skincare-business.jpg?itok=HYmaLIBv", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/48/847/170727_3559065_Blac_Chyna___Rob_Kardashian_s_Relationship_T.jpg?itok=GvLEduck", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/04/alexia-nepola-frankie-rosello-wwhl.jpg?itok=PvjMMiiN", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/11/personal-space-blac-chyna-sue-kardashian.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/themes/custom/reality/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2023/11/Erika-Jayne.jpg?itok=Y2WJV_vf", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/10/season-10-quad-webb.jpg?itok=afX2o0_8", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/lindsay-hubbard-carl-radke.jpg?itok=I8P-QZzg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/winter_house_tom_schwatrz_katie_flood.jpg?itok=wflW9cr2", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/10/vanderpump-rules-jax-taylor-01.jpg?itok=UdTOIKTs", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/Kathy-Hilton-Kyle-Richards-Mauricio-Umansky.jpg?itok=pfDsfn5Z", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/madison-lecroy-craig-conover-paige-desorbo.jpg?itok=sDoU_mGr", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/10/samantha-feher-kory-keefer.jpg?itok=en0Xid7H", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/sutton.jpg?itok=CeHpA_sh", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/mia-thornton-family.jpg?itok=EuiR7Ke7", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2021/05/tinsley-mortimer-earrings.jpg?itok=_PPHOnYZ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/09/winter-house-season-3-tom-schwartz_0.jpg?itok=2jF41LfT", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/3_2_medium/public/2023/11/vanderpump-rules-kristen-doute-luke-broderick.jpg?itok=d0ZuAFzP"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/11/personal-space-blac-chyna-sue-kardashian.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/personal-space/blac-chyna-vs-rob-kardashian-kris-jenner-lawsuit-headed-to-trial", "title": "Blac Chyna's Lawsuit Against Rob Kardashian Kris Jenner Kim Kardashian Explained", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1144313, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Blac Chyna's Big Lawsuit Against the Kardashian Family Is Moving Ahead\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/11\\/personal-space-blac-chyna-sue-kardashian.jpg?itok=VnsivRNT\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/11\\/personal-space-blac-chyna-sue-kardashian.jpg?itok=wbMypgZp\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/11\\/personal-space-blac-chyna-sue-kardashian.jpg?itok=lTklQ3Cu\",\"70x70\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/fp_scale_crop_70x70\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/11\\/personal-space-blac-chyna-sue-kardashian.jpg?itok=s0Q29rjM\"}}", "description": "Blac Chyna's 13-month-old lawsuit\u00a0against her ex\u00a0Rob Kardashian\u00a0as well as his mother,\u00a0Kris Jenner,\u00a0and sisters\u00a0Kourtney Kardashian,", "og": {"site_name": "Bravo TV Official Site", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.bravotv.com/personal-space/blac-chyna-vs-rob-kardashian-kris-jenner-lawsuit-headed-to-trial", "title": "Guess Who's Finally Going to Kourt?
