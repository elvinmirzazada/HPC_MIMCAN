When asked where the actor was, she told Entertainment Tonight he was home with their 4-year-old daughter Everly.\n\n\u201cHe is so happy to have a night off, yes,\u201d she said. Not long after, Tatum, also 37, was spotted dining with a group of friends at Craig\u2019s restaurant without Dewan Tatum.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan \u2018Have Lovingly Chosen to Separate\u2019 After Nearly 9 Years of Marriage\n\nBut the actress\u2019s Oscars date night with BFF Emmanuelle Chriqui also wasn\u2019t the only recent solo outing as of late.\n\nDays after the Oscars, Dewan spent the day practicing her magic with Everly at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Los Angeles.\n\nThe couple \u2014 who often gushed about each other on social media \u2014 were also uncharacteristically mum over the last few months on their accounts.\n\nHowever, as buzz of a split grew louder, they put on a united front and attended the Kids\u2019 Choice Awards together with their daughter and also shared cute snaps of a recent pool and face painting day in March.\n\nIn February, Dewan opened up to Health about the perception that she and Tatum had a \u201cperfect life,\u201d saying instead that they worked hard to keep their relationship going.\n\n\u201cWhen people say you guys have such a perfect life, I want to scream and tell them no one\u2019s perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are such things as great fits. It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we\u2019ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.\u201d\n\nDewan said while they always made sure to make time for one another, they still had days where they didn\u2019t get along.\n\n\u201cBut I think a couple needs to be conscious and to want to do the work and be willing to look at the parts of you that need work. Both of us have been pretty aware and willing to do that,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had the same values. But we\u2019re not perfect! Are you kidding? We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don\u2019t really like each other.\u201d\n\nMusing on the institution of marriage, Dewan said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there should be any expectation, any sort of \u2018You\u2019re bonded to me for the rest of your life,\u2019 thick and thin. I think that\u2019s an older generational thought.\u201d\n\nAnd while the former couple was known for posting countless photos together on social media, Tatum last posted about Dewan in December. He celebrated the actress\u2019 birthday with a heartfelt message.\n\n\u201cThis creature is one more year beautiful. The transformation she invoked this year has been something they only write about in books of fairytale and magic. Your strength and grace ever-evolving,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBy doing so you make everything around you grow- everything. And I am so very grateful for your lessons. Happy life day my love.\u201d\n\nThe two first met on the set of their 2006 movie Step Up, and began dating shortly after. They tied the knot in 2009.", "images":
