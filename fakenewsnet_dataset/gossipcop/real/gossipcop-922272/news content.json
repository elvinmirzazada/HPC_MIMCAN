The former public school teacher died of a heart condition.\n\n\u201c6 Months ago today I said bye for now to the first smile I\u2019d ever seen. I miss you So much Mommy. I know you\u2019re there and I can\u2019t wait to see that smile again. Till then 143\u2026,\u201d Latifah, 48, wrote alongside the smiling photo.\n\nThe actress announced in an emotional statement that Owens had died back in March after struggling with a heart condition for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart that I share the news my mother, Rita Owens passed away today,\u201d said Latifah. \u201cAnyone that has ever met her knows what a bright light she was on this earth. She was gentle, but strong, sweet, but sassy, worldy but pragmatic, a woman of great faith and certainly the love of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had struggled with a heart condition for many years and her battle is now over,\u201d Latifah shared. \u201cI am heartbroken but know she is at peace. Thank you for your kindness, support and respect for our privacy at this time. Much Love, Dana Owens (aka Queen Latif\u200eah), forever Rita Owens\u2019 daughter.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Queen Latifah\u2019s Mother Rita Owens Has Died After Struggling with a Heart Condition\n\nLatifah first revealed to PEOPLE in 2015 that when she\u2019s not in California, she stayed at her mother\u2019s home in New Jersey, sharing caregiving duties with relatives and a nurse.\n\n\u201cAs a caregiver \u2013 it\u2019s just like being a parent, like some things really don\u2019t matter,\u201d Latifah said. \u201cAll the kind of frivolous things sort of fall to the side because there\u2019s something way more important than all that. And when we go through these things together as a family, I realize, these are the important things, these are the important moments.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWhatever some tabloid printed means nothing, money doesn\u2019t mean anything, work is great \u2013 I work so that I can take care of my family \u2013 but the family is the most important thing.\u201d", "images":
