More stories exploring friendship, marriage and parenting it seems, plus - of course - \"the malignancy of lies\".\n\nRelated Story Nicole pays tribute to Reese in Globes speech\n\n\"[Moriarty] came up with a novella, which was key. David took it and thought, 'Is there something I can do with it?'\" Bloys told Vulture. \"Reese and Nicole were involved, and they felt that there was more life in the characters. Everybody approached it from a place of love and care [for] these characters and this property, and again, with a little dose of skepticism along the way.\"\n\nHBO\n\nWitherspoon said in a statement that season 2 provides \"the opportunity to delve deeper into the lives of these intriguing and intricate Monterey families and bring more of their stories back to the audience who embraced and championed them.\"\n\n\u201cThis is inspired by the overwhelming response from audiences around the world,\" added Kidman. \"What a journey this has been. I\u2019m so grateful to have this opportunity to keep exploring these female characters and make this series with my friends.\u201d\n\n\n\nReese Witherspoon and Zoe Kravitz look intense in season 2 HBO\n\nHBO describes the second series like so: \"The subversive, darkly comedic drama Big Little Lies will explore the malignancy of lies, the durability of friendships, the fragility of marriage and, of course, the vicious ferocity of sound parenting. Relationships will fray, loyalties will erode\u2026 the potential for emotional and bodily injury shall loom.\"\n\nThe director\n\nWhile the first season was helmed by Canadian director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e (known for his work on Dallas Buyers Club and alongside Witherspoon in Wild), the second series will be directed by English filmmaker Andrea Arnold. Her work has won several accolades at the Cannes Film Festival, and she recently directed three episodes of the Emmy-winning series Transparent.\n\n\"I\u2019m beyond excited to be working with talented and acclaimed director Andrea Arnold who will be at the helm,\" said Witherspoon. \"Andrea\u2019s unique storytelling style will be a welcome addition to the filmmaking team.\u201d\n\nWitherspoon paid tribute to Vall\u00e9e backstage at the 2018 Golden Globes following Big Little Lies' award win for Best Television Limited Series.\n\nThe \u2019Big Little Lies\u2019 cast at the 2018 Golden Globes Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe are so deeply grateful to Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e,\u201d she said. \u201cHis vision for these characters \u2014 he put his artistry and his heart and soul into it. His musical taste is all over this miniseries. Unfortunately, he was busy.\n\n\u201cWe did try and accommodate, but we wanted to get the second season going soon. We were lucky to have Andrea Arnold sign on to the family. Jean-Marc has welcomed her to the family and we\u2019re thrilled to have her on board.\u201d\n\nThe cast\n\nThe entire main first-season cast has been confirmed to return. When HBO announced the new series, it noted that Witherspoon, Kidman and Woodley would all be starring. It was later confirmed that Shailene Woodley, Zoe Kravitz and Laura Dern would all also be reappearing - as will Kathryn Newton, who plays Madeleine (Witherspoon)'s daughter Abigail. Adam Scott will also be reprising his role as Ed Mackenzie.\n\nAccording to reports, Witherspoon and Kidman have negotiated a pretty substantial pay rise for the second series and will each be taking home $1 million per episode. According to The Hollywood Reporter they both earned around $250,000 per episode for season one. It's believed that Woodley, Dern and Kravitz will also be getting a sizeable bump in pay.\n\nThe big news, of course, centres around a new addition to the cast; Meryl Streep is moving to Monterey. The Oscar-winning actress, who invited herself to join the cast without even having seen the script, is set to shake things up as Celeste's mother-in-law, Mary Louise Wright. Witherspoon confirmed the casting via Instagram.\n\nMary Louise's son, Perry, who was played by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, met his demise at the end of season one and it seems as though his mother has come to town to ask questions. According to on-set pictures which were captured during filming, Mary Louise finds herself on the wrong side of Madeleine, who was seen throwing an ice cream at her.\n\n\n\nIt was later reported that Streep went to great lengths in order to play a realistic mother to Skarsg\u00e5rd's character, wearing prosthetic teeth throughout filming in order to replicate a similar smile to the Swedish actor.\n\nThe rumours were confirmed by her hair and make-up artist, J. Roy Helland, who told Refinery29: \u201cShe needed to be believable as Perry\u2019s mother.\"\n\nMonica Schipper // Getty Images\n\nBut what of Skarsg\u00e5rd's character, Perry? Despite his death being shown in the season one finale, the actor was notably coy when asked about the second series at the Golden Globes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m really dead or not,\u201d he told NBC. \"We'll see.\"\n\nWatch this space...\n\nIn terms of other new characters, Crystal R Fox has been cast as Bonnie Carlson's mother, Elizabeth Howard, Mo McRae will play Michael Perkins, a new teacher at Otter Bay Elementary School and finally, Douglas Smith will be joining the cast as an \"off-beat surfer, aspiring marine biologist and Jane\u2019s co-worker\" Corey Brockfield.\n\nWill there be a third series?\n\nAlthough it seemed unlikely that Big Little Lies would even have a second series given it was initially based on one book, a third series has been ruled out entirely.\n\n\u201cThere's no such plan now (for a season three),\"Big Little Lies executive producer and showrunner David E. Kelly said during the show's appearance at the 2019 TCA winter press tour. \"We like where our closure is at the end of season 2.\u201d", "images":
