The trip was payback for a surprise trip to Utah, which Hough took Laich on for his 35th birthday in June. There, they toured Zion National Park, swam in Lake Powell, hiked in Bryce Canyon National Park and went canyoneering in Canaan Mountain Wilderness, among other adventures.\n\nLike before, both shared photos and videos from their getaway on Instagram.\n\n\u201cTalk about best birthday ever,\u201d she said on Instagram Stories. \u201cThis is unbelievable.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy husband knocked my 30th birthday out of the park\u2026 and all the way to Machu Picchu,\u201d Hough captioned one photo of them, as they snuggled up (in coordinating ponchos and hats, natch) while sitting on a mountain overlooking the 15th-century Inca site.\n\nJulianne Hough/Instagram\n\nJulianne Hough/Instagram\n\nShe went on to explain that coming to Machu Picchu has \u201calways been a dream,\u201d but that it was especially significant because it marked \u201ca monumental closing of a chapter and beginning of a new one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been on such a journey the last few years but especially in the last 7 months,\u201d Hough explained. \u201cBrooks has been there every step of the way supporting me in all of my out of the box, wild ideas and dreams\u2026 discovering new parts of me I didn\u2019t even know existed. I couldn\u2019t be happier turning 30 and feeling so much more of what life truly is about. #unfiltered and totally #unknown \u2014 Life is absolutely remarkable!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you Brooks for completely blowing my mind with your thoughtful and adventurous spirit!\u201d she continued. \u201cI love you so much I can\u2019t even handle myself! #machupicchu #pachamamma #fathersun #bestbirthdayever #dressedtoimpress \ud83d\ude1c #divinefeminine #spire #energyrich.\u201d\n\nLaich was just as sentimental about his wife.\n\n\u201cWords cannot express how much love I have for you babe!\u201d he wrote in a birthday tribute to her. \u201cI love your spirit and your soul, and you bring more joy into my life than I could have ever imagined. You are a powerful young woman capable of anything you want in this world, and I can\u2019t wait to see how you continue to grow, evolve, and change the world!\u201d\n\nIn a video he posted from the mountain cliff, Laich showed his followers the views they experienced while sneaking in a smooch with Hough. \u201cThis is a very spiritual and sacred place. And I\u2019m just happy that I\u2019m able to bring [you] here \u2014 that you love this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have an amazing adventure here in Machu Picchu. Take a look, this is beautiful. Happy birthday, babe.\u201d\n\nHough was so excited she said she couldn\u2019t \u201ceven move right now.\u201d\n\nWhen she did move, Hough made sure to film a video to her followers, asking them to participate in a breathing exercise with her \u201cto send and receive love and gratitude to the world, to humanity and all that keeps us alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I really want for my birthday is to spread more love for the world,\u201d she said in the clip. \u201cThat\u2019s what the world needs, is some giving and some receiving of love. \u2026 I want that to be my birthday present. If you guys are cool to give that to me, I would be forever grateful. But it\u2019s not just for me, it\u2019s for you. It\u2019s for everybody in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s all do it together and spread and receive all the love we can!!!!\u201d she wrote in the video\u2019s caption. \u201cThank you in advance for the incredible birthday presents!!!! \ud83d\ude42 love you all sooooooo much!!!!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u2764\ufe0f.\u201d\n\nVikings star Maude Hirst and Hough\u2019s assistant and \u201cgreat friend\u201d Kristy Sowin were also along for the fun.\n\n\u201cHappy Birthday to my favorite person ever,\u201d wrote Sowin. \u201c\u2018You must be the change you wish to see in the world\u2019 couldn\u2019t describe Jules any better. This girl is filled with more joy, compassion, love, and energy than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. I often say that I don\u2019t feel like I have a job, and that\u2019s because my job is simply supporting this girl in her mission to impact the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me personally, Jules you have believed in me when I didn\u2019t believe in myself and have (patiently) helped me build a foundation of support in myself that I never thought was possible,\u201d she said. \u201cYou make me laugh harder, love deeper, and express myself more freely. Our memories range from hiking Machu Picchu (2 hours ago), watching too many hours of SVU in the back of the tour bus, getting me a puppy, walking on fire, driving each other crazy, endless closet clean outs, 5,000 breakthroughs, obsessing over our dogs, and more. I am so grateful to be your right hand chick, and wouldn\u2019t rather be anywhere else.\u201d\n\nMaude Hirst/Instagram\n\nMaude Hirst/Instagram\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Go Inside the World\u2019s Best Hotel\n\nHirst called Hough an \u201cincredible woman\u201d in a photo of the two doing yoga moves together.\n\n\u201cI love you more and more everyday, and what a way to celebrate you today,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cMachu Picchu, you have our hearts,\u201d she added, calling Hough\u2019s big day the \u201cbest birthday ever.\u201d", "images":
