After premiering her brand new video for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d Taylor Swift gave her backup dancers a present for keeping quiet about their role in the much-anticipated music video.\n\nSwift decided to premiere the video at the MTV VMAs, right after releasing a lyrical video that helped debut the song itself. The video was pretty complex \u2014 Swift is pretty much saying goodbye to her old personas and focusing on a rebrand. She already broke a record for having the most views a day after release \u2014 43.2 million views to be exact. And that number is, obviously, still climbing.\n\nAs we all know, success on projects like this happen when you\u2019ve got a solid team by your side. Which is why we\u2019re glad that Swift made sure to share her appreciation for those who helped out by sending flowers and a really sweet card.\n\n\"Thanks for keeping our secret. \ud83d\ude42 I'm so proud of it and I hope you will be too.\" - Taylor sent the #LWYMMDVideo dancers flowers \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/x08ea8pGBX \u2014 Taylor Swift News (@TSwiftDailyNews) August 29, 2017\n\nThe card read, \u201cThanks for keeping our secret. \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m so proud of it and I hope you will be too. Sending my love and gratitude, Taylor.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Swift has sent a bouquet to share her appreciation. She also sent flowers to those who stood by her during her recent trial. The employees at a company called Craftsy let Swift know that they were on her side by creating Post-It note messages on their windows, with motivational phrases like \u201cFree Tay,\u201d and song lyrics like \u201cPeople throw rocks at things that shine.\u201d\n\nThank you @taylorswift13! We're so happy our messages brightened your day as much as your flowers brightened ours! \ud83e\udd17 pic.twitter.com/Yd0QvdBXQh \u2014 Craftsy (@beCraftsy) August 15, 2017\n\nWe\u2019re all about the sweet gesture. It\u2019s good to know that Swift gives credit where credit\u2019s due.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/01042959/definitive-350x350.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/30000606/taylor-swift-music-video.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410im_/http://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hg/images/xoxo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/31105441/labordaymakeup-350x350.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410im_/http://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hg/images/illustrations/7.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410im_/http://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hg/images/newsletter-illustration.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/31053148/aerie-350x350.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/30000606/taylor-swift-music-video.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410/http://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-gave-her-look-what-you-made-me-do-dancers-a-special-gift/", "title": "Taylor Swift gave her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" dancers a special gift for \"keeping our secret\"", "meta_data": {"fb": {"admins": 100001889240714, "pages": 209123339112078}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@hellogiggles", "creator": "@KarenEBelz", "title": "Taylor Swift gave her \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d dancers a special gift for \u201ckeeping our secret\u201d", "description": "This is super sweet.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/30000606/taylor-swift-music-video-376x283.jpg"}, "description": "It's pretty sweet that Taylor Swift made sure to acknowledge her dancers for keeping her record-breaking video a secret.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift gave her \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d dancers a special gift for \u201ckeeping our secret\u201d", "description": "This is super sweet.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410/http://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-gave-her-look-what-you-made-me-do-dancers-a-special-gift/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "updated_time": "2017-08-30T15:12:10-07:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410im_/http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/08/30000606/taylor-swift-music-video.jpg", "width": 999, "height": 532}}, "article": {"tag": "taylor swift", "section": "Celeb", "published_time": "2017-08-30T07:09:51-07:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-30T15:12:10-07:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.8.1"}, "movies": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170902154410if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/3tmd-ClpJxA?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1504102191.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
