He just couldn\u2019t give up his bachelor kind of lifestyle.\u201d\n\nThe former couple, whose love story became a dramatic plot line on \u201cThe Real Housewives of New York City,\u201d faced rampant rumors of infidelity on his part during their courtship but nonetheless tied the knot in a glamorous wedding.\n\n\u201cIt was a beautiful wedding, it was his birthday, it was one hell of a party and it was New Year\u2019s Eve, so I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d\n\nThe reality star also maintains that the cameras didn\u2019t fully capture their romantic side during their short-lived marriage, which was her second and his first.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t get to see that part, there was love, there was as good times,\u201d the mom of two said. \u201cI want people to know that it wasn\u2019t just all of this scandalous talk in the papers.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if she\u2019ll be deleting the evidence of her time with D\u2019Agastino on social media, the Countess says the proof isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take the pictures down, I\u2019m not that kind of person,\u201d she said.\n\nMoving forward, the reality star-turned-interior designer says she hasn\u2019t been dating much and is \u201cjust chilling.\u201d However, a source told us last month she\u2019s actually \u201cdating tons of people.\u201d", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/08/luann.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/72971091.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/72944522.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/serena-williams-72963750.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/taylor-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/08/luann.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/10/18/luann-de-lesseps-has-no-regrets-after-tom-debacle/", "title": "Luann de Lesseps has no regrets after Tom debacle", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2023 NYP Holdings.
