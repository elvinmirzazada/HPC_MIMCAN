She continues to fight for the rights to her unreleased music, according to a recent tweet.\n\nPink isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s spoken out against Dr. Luke since him and Kesha, 30, found themselves fighting it out in court.\n\nKelly Clarkson slammed him in March 2016, revealing on the Kyle and Jackie O radio show that she was forced by her label to work with him. She said he was notoriously difficult to work with.\n\n\u201cI only worked with him because, literally, I got blackmailed by my label. They were like, \u2018We will not put your album out if you don\u2019t do this,'\u201d she said at the time.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard for me.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/10/06/2LEYNLDYQDRWVHHKACUQ22VDSI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NYDN-LOGO-WHITE-J.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/10/06/2LEYNLDYQDRWVHHKACUQ22VDSI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caitlyn Hitt"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/10/06/pink-slams-dr-luke-as-not-a-good-person-amid-legal-battle-with-kesha/", "title": "Pink slams Dr. Luke as \u2018not a good person\u2019 amid legal battle with Kesha", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "This high flying popstar is taking a stand.", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Pink slams Dr. Luke as \u2018not a good person\u2019 amid legal battle with Kesha", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/10/06/pink-slams-dr-luke-as-not-a-good-person-amid-legal-battle-with-kesha/", "description": "In an interview with The New York Times, Pink shared her thoughts on the turbulent legal battle between controversial music producer Dr. Luke and Kesha.
