The 4:44 rapper called the controversial Commander-in-Chief a \u201csuperbug\u201d and a \u201cjoke,\u201d and purchased one of John Oliver\u2019s \u201cMake Donald Drumpf Again\u201d hats. But, during his interview with David Letterman on the upcoming edition of Netflix\u2019s My Next Guest, he explained why Trump is \u201cactually a great thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that what he\u2019s forcing people to do is have conversations and [forcing] people to band together and work together,\u201d Jay-Z explained. \u201cYou can\u2019t really address something that\u2019s not revealed. He\u2019s bringing out an ugly side of America that we wanted to believe was gone, and it\u2019s still here. We still gotta deal with it.\u201d\n\nHe further encouraged Americans to have the \u201ctough conversations\u201d: \u201cWe have to talk about the N-word and we have to talk about why white men are so privileged in this country.\u201d\n\nLetterman agreed, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t need more evidence\u201d to decide whether Trump himself is a racist. \u201cYou\u2019re having a debate over whether a guy is a racist, chances are that guy\u2019s a racist,\u201d he remarked.\n\nOther topics that will be addressed when the full episode of My Next Guest debuts on Netflix this Friday include the coming out story of Jay-Z\u2019s mother and the hip-hop star\u2019s daughter, Blue Ivy Carter.\n\nJay-Z previously addressed Trump in a lengthy chat with BBC Radio 1 in September. \u201cThis guy, I\u2019m looking at him like, man, this is a joke, with all \u2014 I can\u2019t even say with all due respect \u2014 with all disrespect,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think that, you know, he\u2019s not a very sophisticated man, especially when it comes to the idea of \u2018until everyone is free, no one is free.\u2019 Period. That\u2019s just a fact. We are all linked some kind of way. So if you oppress a certain people, everyone is in danger, karmically and in real life.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the forthcoming tour with wife Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z is also using his passions to fuel television and film projects. The Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story docu-series, executive produced by Jay-Z, will debut at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York before airing on the Paramount Network. This follows his prison reform series, TIME: The Kalief Browder Story, which premiered in March of last year.", "images":
