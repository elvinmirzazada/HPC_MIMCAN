I'll look forward to my return, as you all lift me up so very much! Please pray for my beloved Zacky, and I will pray for all suffering from this debilitating disease called depression.\"\n\nIn a statement to ET, Delilah's rep says, \"Thank you for your thoughts, prayers and understanding during this devastating time for Delilah and her family.\"\n\nSadly, Zack isn't the first child the mother of 13 has lost -- one of her adopted sons, Sammy, died in 2012 from complications from sickle-cell anemia.\n\nDelilah, who has handled thousands of song requests and dedications throughout her radio career, has an extensive fan base in the millions who listen to her nationally syndicated radio show nightly.\n\nLinkin Park's Chester Bennington, who also suffered from depression, died of suicide earlier this year. His wife, Talinda Bennington, shared similar sentiments to Delilah after the singer's passing.
