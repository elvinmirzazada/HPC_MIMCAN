She performed \u201cHollaback Girl,\u201d and, at Shelton\u2019s request, her No Doubt track, \u201cHella Good.\u201d\n\n\"Will you do it with me?\" Stefani is seen asking her beau in a fan video after he asked for the song.\n\n\n\n\u201cI know it's weird that I'm here,\u201d she told the country-loving crowd, \u201cbut we all have one thing in common -- we all love Blake Shelton!\"\n\nShelton then joined Stefani on stage as the band played the song, and the two shared a kiss at the end of Stefani\u2019s set.\n\n\n\n\"I didn't think this was ever gonna happen!\" the No Doubt frontwoman remarked, pointing to Shelton. \"Sexiest man alive!\"\n\nStefani shared some pics from the star-studded after party, which also included performances by Shelton himself, as well as pals Kelly Clarkson, Luke Bryan and more. The 48-year-old singer even posted a boomerang shot of her beau singing, which she decorated with a heart, as well as a clip of Clarkson\u2019s set.\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram\n\nThe sweet impromptu duet wasn\u2019t the only musical moment the couple shared on Sunday, however. Stefani was also spotted singing along to Shelton\u2019s performance of \u201cI Lived It\u201d during the ACM Awards and afterwards gave him a beaming standing ovation.\n\nThough the couple skipped the ACM red carpet, they posed for pics in the audience together, with Shelton rocking a gray blazer, black button-down shirt and jeans, while Stefani stunned in a short crimson dress with black knee-high boots and her long, straight blonde locks cascading over her shoulders\n\nSee more on their sweet and stylish date night in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-08%2Fblake_shelton_gwen_stefani_gettyimages-632032722.jpg%3Fh%3Dab246cea&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2Fblack_shelton_gwen_stefani_gettyimages-946698504_1280.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-04/gettyimages-946674728.jpg?h=9d7727dc&width=640", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018-04%2F1280_lukebryan_041518.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/et_041518_blakegwenvidpic.png?h=c673cd1c"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/et_041518_blakegwenvidpic.png?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-perform-a-no-doubt-song-together-at-acm-awards-after-party-watch", "title": "Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani Perform a No Doubt Song Together at ACM Awards After Party -- Watch!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/et_041518_blakegwenvidpic.png?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The couple also had an adorable date night at the Las Vegas awards show on Sunday.", "title": "Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani Perform a No Doubt Song Together", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-perform-a-no-doubt-song-together-at-acm-awards-after-party-watch", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The couple also had an adorable date night at the Las Vegas awards show on Sunday.", "twitter": {"description": "The couple also had an adorable date night at the Las Vegas awards show on Sunday.", "title": "Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani Perform a No Doubt Song Together", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-perform-a-no-doubt-song-together-at-acm-awards-after-party-watch", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/et_041518_blakegwenvidpic.png?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani Perform a No Doubt Song Together at ACM Awards After Party -- Watch! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Music, Awards, News, Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton, Certified Country", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
