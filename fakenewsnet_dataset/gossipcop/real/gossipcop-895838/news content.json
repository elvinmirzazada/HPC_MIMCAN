With it, you'll get the console and 3 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for even less. Price check: Walmart - $249\n\nXbox Series X Diablo 4 Bundle + 3 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: $484.98 at Microsoft\n\nThis bundle offers a fantastic way to secure one of the most popular Xbox Series X games for less. Not only are you getting an included copy of Diablo 4, but also 3 months' worth of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription time.\n\nCrucial P3 Plus 2TB NVMe M.2 SSD: was $189.99 now $98.99 at Amazon\n\nIt doesn't get much cheaper than this when it comes to M.2 SSDs with a huge 2TB of storage. While certainly not the fastest storage drive on the market, PS5 owners who want to store and run a ton of games without needing to delete older ones as much will be well-served here. Especially now that it's under $100. Price check: Best Buy - $98.99 | Newegg - $98.99\n\nBlack Friday deals 2023: Phones\n\niPhone 14: was $729.99 now $679.99 at Best Buy\n\nBest Buy has knocked a record-high $50 off the price of Apple's standard iPhone 14 for Black Friday. If you're simply looking for a capable iPhone at a cut price, then the iPhone 13 (which is now discounted at Apple) is pretty much the same phone as the iPhone 14 but cheaper. That said, Best Buy's device-only price is a good one, so if you're already sold on the iPhone 14, this is the deal to go for.\n\nApple iPhone 15 series: get a free iPad and Apple Watch with an unlimited plan at Verizon\n\nVerizon's headline pre-Black Friday deal is here, and it's offering a free 10th-gen iPad 10.9 and a free 2nd-gen Apple Watch SE. These freebies alone are worth $780 by themselves, so this is a significant addition to the host of already awesome trade-in rebates on the iPhone 15 series. The caveat here, however, is that you'll still need an unlimited data plan to be eligible for this saving.\n\nApple iPhone 15 Pro: up to $1,000 off with a trade-in, plus free iPad and Apple Watch at Verizon\n\nThis is our favorite trade-in rebate available right now on Verizon. While the maximum saving of $1,000 off is nothing new on the excellent iPhone 15 Pro, Verizon is letting you hand over any iPhone model to achieve that maximum rebate. That means you can potentially hand over an old beater and get a new Phone 15 Pro in return - plus the free Apple Watch and iPad. Note, this promo is only eligible with a new line on an unlimited data plan (upgraders can get up to $830 off).\n\nApple iPhone 14 Plus: get four devices with an unlimited data plan for $120 per month at Verizon\n\nVerizon's latest promotion offers four iPhone 14 Plus handsets for just $40 each - and that's with a line on an unlimited data plan. Yes, the bundled plan is the carrier's more basic 'Unlimited Welcome' tier, but this is still an amazing offer. Previously, an iPhone 14 Plus bundled with a single line would have cost close to $100 by itself, so you get some incredible savings here.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S23 Ultra: was $1,199.99 now $899.99 at Amazon\n\nWinner of TechRadar's reader's choice awards for 2023, the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is a fantastic pick if you're on the hunt for a flagship device with heaps of power, a gorgeous display, and class-leading cameras. It's currently on sale for a record-low price at Amazon, though if you're in the latter region and have an existing Samsung device to trade in, Samsung's discount-plus-rebate offer may be the better option.\n\nBlack Friday deals 2023: headphones\n\nBeats Studio Buds: was $149.95 now $89.95 at Amazon\n\nThe Beats Studio Buds are the best Beats earbuds you can buy, and Amazon now has the earbuds down to $99.95 \u2013 just $10 more than the record-low price. You're getting Active Noise Cancelling technology, a comfortable fit, and decent audio performance. Compared to Apple's AirPods Pro 2 (which are regularly priced at $234), this deal is a great alternative for premium earbuds under $100.\n\nBeats Studio Pro: was $349 now $169.99 at Amazon\n\nThis massive saving makes Beats' newest, July 2023 over-ears a whopping 51% cheaper than they were at launch \u2013 a return to their lowest-seen price during Amazon's Prime Day event. They're gorgeous looking, easy to use and the sound is good, (read about it in our Beats Studio Pro review) so if the lack of multipoint and wearer detection doesn't bother you, this is a solid deal.\n\nBose QuietComfort Earbuds II: was $299 now $199 at Amazon\n\nIf you want the best noise-blocking power, you can get for the price, these deliver it. They also sound superb and have a ton of useful smart features. But the headline is the noise cancellation, and you can't get better for under $200. Actually, you basically can't get better, period. Oh, and this is the cheapest they've ever been \u2013 we'd be surprised if they go any lower.\n\nBlack Friday deals 2023: Mattresses\n\nNectar Serenity weighted blanket: was $149 now from $63 at Nectar\n\nCozy and soothing, the Nectar Serenity weighted blanket contains pockets full of glass beads that apply gentle pressure across the body. Right now, you can save up to an extra 6% on a Nectar Serenity weighted blanket with our exclusive link. That's a standard 15lb blanket for a very calming $63.\n\nSaatva Classic mattress: was $1,095 now from $695 at Saatva\n\nExclusive: The Saatva Classic is a luxurious innerspring hybrid mattress that's available in three different sleep feels and two sizes, and it sits in the #1 spot of our best mattress ranking. Our testers found it was comfortable in all sleeping positions, and well-suited to hot sleepers and people with back pain. The extras are great too: you get a 365-night trial and lifetime warranty. Click any of the links on this page to unlock an exclusive $400 discount, which means a queen size is currently $1,595.\n\nNectar Memory Foam mattress: now from $359 at Nectar\n\nThe Nectar is a great all-rounder memory foam mattress that will suit plenty of tastes and sleep styles. Right now there's a flash sale that knocks 40% off everything, which takes the price of a queen down to $659.

It comes with a lifetime warranty and a year's risk-free trial, so you'll have plenty of time to make sure it suits you.\n\nHelix Midnight mattress: was $936 now from $702, plus additional free bedding at Helix\n\nThe Helix Midnight is a softer memory foam hybrid. We think it's the best mattresses for side sleepers because the plush foams contour to the sleeper's joints, allowing the lower hip and shoulder to sink in just enough to prevent pressure from building up and ensuring neutral spinal alignment. Right now, there's 25% off all sizes, with a free bedding bundle, including pillows, sheets, and a protector, thrown in for free. That drops the cost of a queen size down to $999.\n\nTempur-Adapt mattress: was $1,699 now from $1,499 at Tempur-Pedic\n\nThe Tempur-Adapt mattress is specialized for contouring comfort, and you can choose from three different sleep feels (soft, medium or firm), or upgrade to a hybrid with springs if you prefer. Tempur-Pedic is known for its high-end, sink-in foams, and the current 30% off deal delivers the best prices we ever see.\n\nThe Casper mattress: was $595 now from $476 at Casper\n\nCasper sales don't come along very often, but for Cyber Monday it's taking 20% off all mattresses (as well as pillows and sheets). This includes its brand new The Casper all-foam mattress, which was already an affordable option and is now even more so. With 20% off, the queen size is reduced to an extremely reasonable $796, with free delivery, a 100-night trial, and a 10-year warranty.\n\nBlack Friday deals 2023: Streaming\n\nMax: $9.99 $2.99 a month for first 6 months\n\nGet Max's Ad-Supported plan and pay just $2.99 a month for your first six months (down from $9.99 a month).

You can get your reality TV fix with a ton of Bravo content, as well as Below Deck and Love Island Games.

Previously, Paramount Plus offered a Black Friday offer on its annual plans, but this one allows you the flexibility of its monthly plans. Pay $1.99 for your first three on its Essential plan (usually $5.99 a month), which is ad-supported, or reap the benefits of both Paramount Plus and Showtime's libraries and lock in a price of just $3.99 a month, down from $11.99.\n\nAmazon Prime Video: Up to 75% off Amazon Channels\n\nFrom Paramount Plus to AMC Plus, STARZ, Britbox, Cinemax, and more, you can upgrade your Amazon Prime Video subscription this Black Friday and get up to 75% in savings on your first two months on a variety of add-ons.

No contracts, Philo hosts a ton of live TV channels in the States, including Comedy Central, AMC, Lifetime, Food Network, TLC, VH1, and more.
