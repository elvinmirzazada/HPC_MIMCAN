Moore noted she\u2019s developed a thick skin due to a \u201ccombination of getting older and wiser and going through the hard knocks of divorce. You realize, I\u2019m not going to take anyone\u2019s sh--.\u201d\n\nFrederick M. Brown / Getty Images\n\nMoore, who is now engaged to musician Taylor Goldsmith, added, \u201cIt emboldened me. There is power in saying no and in asking for what you deserve. There is power in knowing your value.\u201d\n\nAnd although her NBC show, \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d is a now roaring success, there were many bumps along the way in her professional life as well, including three failed pilot seasons.\n\nFrazer Harrison / Getty Images The cast of \"This Is Us\" during the 24th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at The Shrine Auditorium on Jan. 21, 2018 in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\"Before I got the part, I was making massive changes in my personal life and was looking to echo that in my work,\" she said. \"I was waiting for something different that would allow me to dig deep. I knew I was capable, but I couldn't get any momentum, and I had just been crushed by three failed pilot seasons.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Moore also weighed in on the growing number of women who have been speaking up about systemic sexual harassment in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a real cultural reckoning \u2014 one that\u2019s definitely past due,\u201d Moore told the magazine. \u201cMen have been using their positions of power to take advantage of women, and it\u2019s so prevalent\u2026I can only hope that what\u2019s happening encourages more women [to speak out] and it serves to put women in more powerful positions across the spectrum.\u201d", "images":
