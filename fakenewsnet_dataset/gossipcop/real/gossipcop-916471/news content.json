Announcing that La La Land had won the award, only for Moonlight to be announced as the actual winner just moments later as the cast and crew of La La Land had just taken the stage. It was a genuinely shocking moment, and Steve Harvey says it was a happy time for him in particular.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter talked to a lot of the people that got caught up in the mess of that night, including host Jimmy Kimmel, La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz, and Mara Buxbaum from Moonlight distributor A24. Steve Harvey turns up for a quick comment, too, detailing why he couldn't be happier to see a flub bigger than the mistake he made when he crowned the wrong Miss Universe winner in 2015.\n\n\u201cI was watching live and I probably knew what had happened before anybody else \u2014 \u2018cause I saw the panic-stricken look on the producer\u2019s face,\" he explained. \"When [Horowitz] walked out there and snatched that card out of Warren\u2019s hand, that\u2019s when I knew redemption was mine.\u201d\n\nHe says it freed him from the burden of that night, and that it was cause for him to celebrate. \"I was finally off the hook. Yeah, OK, I had to live that down: \u2018Oh, how could he,\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a bonehead,\u2019 \u2018Nobody\u2019s ever done that in the history of Miss Universe.\u2019 But the Oscars is the biggest night in Hollywood, and when they did it, I lit a cigar and drank a glass of scotch and celebrated. I was free! Thank you, God!\u201d\n\nOf course, it helps that Moonlight deserved the award a lot more, too.", "images":
