A witness tells us officers then discovered at least one gun in the car ... a big no-no for Offset, who is a convicted felon.\n\nOffset and Cardi B welcomed their daughter, Kulture, into the world earlier this month ... we're told neither Cardi nor the baby were in the vehicle at the time of Offset's arrest.\n\nWe're still working to confirm details with law enforcement.", "images":
