I was blown away!\u201d Kardashian tweeted on June 26, referring to her 33rd birthday party from the night before. \u201cIm so lucky and blessed! Thank you so much baby!!! You treat me like a queen!\u201d\n\nKardashian is reportedly four months pregnant.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that the Polaroid photo wasn\u2019t meant to be taken literally. People close to Kardashian and Thompson told TMZ at the time that \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d were simply syrupy nicknames they used for each other.\n\nKardashian also suggested she was hungover in a tweet on the same day she posted the \u201cDad + Mom\u201d picture.\n\nThe reality star revealed over the summer that she had gotten off of birth control during a testimonial segment on \u201cKeeping up with the Kardashians.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants to have about five or six kids with me and that\u2019s lovely,\u201d Kardashian said on the show. \u201cWe could start at one and we could grow from there. But now knowing I\u2019m not on birth control is scary. It\u2019s like a really big step.\u201d\n\nHer pregnancy news came less than a week after reports emerged that her 20-year-old half-sister Kylie Jenner is pregnant as well. Her older sister Kim, meanwhile, is reportedly expecting a child via surrogate.", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/09/27/YW3TWTUH43ZDCY2PGDP2DGXJTQ.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NYDN-LOGO-WHITE-J.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/09/27/YW3TWTUH43ZDCY2PGDP2DGXJTQ.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sblendorio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/09/27/khloe-kardashian-might-have-dropped-a-clue-she-was-pregnant-months-ago/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian might have dropped a clue she was pregnant months ago", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "The reality star may have hinted she was pregnant months ago.", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Khloe Kardashian might have dropped a clue she was pregnant months ago", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/09/27/khloe-kardashian-might-have-dropped-a-clue-she-was-pregnant-months-ago/", "description": "Khloe Kardashian may have hinted she was expecting a child long before news of her pregnancy emerged.
