We\u2019ve already oohed and ahhed at Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s ultraorganized pantry, but now we\u2019re ogling her playroom, which features the most beautiful rainbow color scheme.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress and Goop CEO enlisted Nashville-based organization service The Home Edit to help her get her Hamptons home in order.\n\nthehomeedit/Instagram/NBC\n\nThey were the ones who did the now-famous pantry, and recently shared snaps of the gorgeous playroom.\n\n\u201cWe just spent the most INCREDIBLE few days at @gwynethpaltrow's Hamptons house,\u201d they posted on Instagram. \u201cOur favorite project from the trip (and of all time) was the playroom.\u201d\n\nThe room features two walls of bookshelves with activities (like board games and a globe) on the left and leisure (like books and plush animals) on the right. To organize it even more, they created zones for reading, games, art, crafts and science.\n\nClosed Captioning ON OFF apply | reset x Text Display\n\nBackground\n\nEnhancements font\n\nTimes New Roman Arial Comic Sans\n\nT T T T size\n\n\n\ncolor share link Gwyneth Paltrow on Goop brand, her acting career, daughter Apple Play Video - 5:22 Gwyneth Paltrow on Goop brand, her acting career, daughter Apple Play Video - 5:22\n\n\u201cWe categorized books and stuffed animals by color so that everything is easy to find (not to mention pretty to look at),\u201d they added. The result is a beautiful crisp white room with strategically placed pops of color. We just wonder how long the meticulous organization will actually last once a kid gets into it.\n\nPaltrow\u2019s children, Apple and Moses, are 13 and 11 respectively, so perhaps they\u2019ll be a little more tidy than, say, a toddler might be.\n\nBest Apple's birthday/Mother's Day EVER at the @museumoficecream \ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf4f@autumncomm SO FUN #goopgo #dtla A post shared by Gwyneth Paltrow (@gwynethpaltrow) on May 14, 2017 at 2:09pm PDT\n\nFeeling inspired to make your own playroom this gorgeous?
