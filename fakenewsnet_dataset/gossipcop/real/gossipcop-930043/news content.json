They\u2019re all looking to wreck some shit and find a particular set of items to do so. The Avengers , non-avengers Black Panther and Doctor Strange included, are the only individuals equipped to put a stop to their antics. Basically, one side wants to destroy half the universe, and everyone else is trying to stop them.\n\nWho\u2019s this purple dude?\n\nIf you\u2019ve glanced at a poster, you know the biggest head belongs to the aforementioned purple alien. Thanos is a dude who talks a big game, but follows through in some major ways. Jim Starlin himself describes the villain as the following: If you\u2019ve glanced at a poster, you know the biggest head belongs to the aforementioned purple alien.

These are high-browed eternals we\u2019re talking about here; too damn high-browed to multitask as decent parents. His mother Sui-Sa, who was kinda nuts, tried to off Thanos because he came out with an ugly mug from the jump. And his father was just an absentee dad. So the dude already had trust issues. All in all, he had some next level trash for parents who fostered his whole \u201cuniverse destroyer\u201d thing.

So what\u2019s his deal?\n\nIt\u2019s not like you had death whispering in your ear since you were a child, egging you like a psychotic cheerleader (I hope). And we\u2019re not talking about the full on skull-and-bones type either. Mistress Death, in the Marvel Universe sense, actually isn\u2019t bad looking in a marrow to bone sort of way; she\u2019s a fully skinned dominatrix with a hood. Thanos already had issues with abandonment, so thanks to his own relationships with killing and destruction, Mistress Death took an interest in his potential, and convinced him that she\u2019d be the only one that could truly love him for who he became.

If friendzoning were a thing (it\u2019s not), Thanos would be the first villain to off entire galaxies to escape it.

These stones were created by a really powerful being who felt lonely one day, and split itself apart into six different fragments on some suicidal shit. (Note: Marvel Cinematic Universe wise, it\u2019s explained through The Big Bang and six singularities that went bang with it.) Like a lovesick puppy, Thanos of course embarks on a quest to get the stones and mount them in a gauntlet for greater control of their power; like a steering wheel on a car.

The first pops up in Loki\u2019s (Tom Hiddleston) mind-control scepter from The Avengers, and in Avengers: Age of Ultron. It\u2019s later seen within the forehead of the sentient robot, Vision, after the stone helped to create the lethally intelligent AI named Ultron.\n\nPowers: An OP ability to hold energies that allow for mind control, energy and astral projection, along with telekinetic and telepathic powers.

Loki is the first to use it by opening a portal from one universe to Earth itself in The Avengers. It then takes up residence in Odin\u2019s (Thor\u2019s pops) own vault for safe keeping.\n\nPowers: If you haven\u2019t already guessed, the space stone has the power to create any sort of bridge between one end of space to another; the ultimate lazy man\u2019s way to travel.

Right now, the Nova Corps (intergalactic police) are hanging onto it.\n\nPowers: If you ever wanted to see a Superman knock off within the Marvel Universe, this is the gift that keeps on re-gifting. If you\u2019re a jogger, you\u2019re now a sprinter. If you\u2019re a 20-pound lifter, you\u2019re now a 20,000-pound lifter. It has the ability to boost the effects of power, from the other gems themselves to the duplication of any physical superhuman ability.

At the moment, it\u2019s in the possession of The Collector (Benicio Del Toro), whose whole shtick is to collect shit.\n\nPowers: The most powerful stone in this list. Reality is what is, and this stone manipulates that with a single thought. If Thanos wants Mistress Death to put a ring on it, he could make it happen (though he\u2019d consider that cheating). No one can detect a change, nor see it coming, and if Thanos wanted to wipe out half a universe with a snap of his fingers (in the comic books, he did) he could.

Reversed, sped up, slowed down, it\u2019s all by the discretion of the wearer. Comic book wise, Thanos even had an altercation where he aged an astral being by a billion years or so, and then turned him into a thumb sucking infant just for kicks (cold).

It can also snatch the knowledge of all those it swallows. There\u2019s no such thing as a secret with this bastard.

How do you stop that?\n\nInfinity Gauntlet (1991) | via Wikipedia Commons.\n\nThat\u2019s kinda the point, the heroes themselves shouldn\u2019t really stand a chance on their own. When the six-issue limited series Infinity Gauntlet landed on December, 1991, it became an immediate success by the suggestion that heroes would die. It had never really been done on that scale. Sure, half of the universe came back, but imagine being the fan waiting patiently for the next issue, knowing full well that Thor, Captain America, Spiderman and Iron Man could be gone for good. MCU-wise, every hero that has appeared from the Black Panther (Chadwick boseman), all the way to Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) are combining their chops to take this guy out thanks to the foreboding by Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the daughter of Thanos (yes he has kids). According to her, it ain\u2019t gonna be pretty. That\u2019s kinda the point, the heroes themselves shouldn\u2019t really stand a chance on their own.

According to Jim Starlin himself, he wanted to woo a woman with some higher education wordplay by attending a psychology class, but that got him interested in Freudian concepts of Thanatos\u2014humanity\u2019s obsession with death and destruction. So even before putting pen to paper, Jim here already had some sick thoughts about a universe destroying villain alternatively named as Thanos, who would eventually come to life on February 1973, Ironman #55, well before his six-part comic book series called The Infinity Gauntlet; what Avengers: Infinity War is partially based around.
