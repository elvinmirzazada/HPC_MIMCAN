Janney played Tonya Harding\u2019s abusive mother LaVona, who bullies her relentlessly throughout the film, while still providing comedic relief. Janney\u2019s dry, snappy performance was heavily praised by critics. She beat out others in the category, including Lesley Manville in Phantom Thread, Laurie Metcalf in Lady Bird, Octavia Spencer in The Shape of Water, and Mary J.
