During a group dinner, Kim, 36, and Khlo\u00e9, 32, started talking about Chelsea Handler and Chelsea Clinton in an attempt to get Disick to admit to his actions. When that didn\u2019t work, Jenner, 61, asked point blank: \u201cI think what we\u2019re all wondering is if you have a girl here and why?\u201d\n\nRelated: Kourtney Kardashian's Body Evolution From Keeping Up With the Kardashians to the red carpet, Kourtney Kardashian's look has changed over the years \u2014 see her body evolution!\n\nIn the preview, it appears the self-proclaimed Lord owns up to bringing Chelsea along on the tropical getaway. \u201cI did something wrong as always,\u201d he says.

She\u2019s upset he would disrupt the family vacation with the kids there and the whole family there and hide a girl in the hotel.\u201d\n\nThank You! You have successfully subscribed.
