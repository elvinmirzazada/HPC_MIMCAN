I\u2019m having a hard time forgiving myself, but I\u2019m working on it. It was incredibly, incredibly embarrassing,\u201d Platten told People. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to retrace steps of what happened \u2026 it has just been hanging over me.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI have done it a bunch of times, but I stepped in front of the people and I felt the expectation. I was ready to open up and do it, and my mind just went blank. I was trying to explain it to my husband: It was like a test that you know all the material to, you study so much and you get in there, and your mind doesn\u2019t cooperate.\u201d\n\nPlatten, who is married to Kevin Lazan, performed the national anthem before Game 1 of the 2016 World Series.\n\n\u201cI was so nervous going into it. The anthem is such a big deal; it\u2019s probably the most important song for our country,\u201d she said. \u201cI always get nervous because it means so much because it is so powerful. I always want to do it justice, do a good job and give people the exact version they expect and they want.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the 36-year-old singer, best known for \u201cFight Song,\u201d was set to perform \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at the Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy, Utah before the NWSL soccer game between the Utah Royals and the Chicago Red Stars.\n\nHowever, she had to restart the anthem twice because she forgot the words, according to multiple media reports. She nervously grinned at the audience at times, at which point they chimed in to help. Many fans tweeted that she still messed up the lyrics her third time around.\n\nomg did rachel platten actually fuck up the national anthem \u2014 B (@chiredstars) April 14, 2018\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Nurse__Kel/status/985244654365966338\n\nBetween #RachelPlatten screwing up the National Anthem 3 times (including wrong lyrics) and #Lifetime cutting to #DanceMoms several times during the beginning\u2026 Bad day for #NWSL. They deserve better\u2026 \u2014 Joy Sperlazzo Hammer (@joyeliya) April 14, 2018\n\nIt was awkward. Rachel Platten at the #URFC match. She was asking for help with opening line after the 2nd try, then sang it wrong a 3rd time & just kept going \u2014 brett ?? (@brettbar) April 14, 2018\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to practice what I\u2019ve been preaching: If I\u2019m telling my fans to love yourself no matter what, I owe myself the same thing even though it\u2019s really hard right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m human. This was a humongous and embarrassing mistake, but it was a mistake. My mind just wasn\u2019t cooperating.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI was proud that I was able to finish \u2026 I actually can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t forget more words and that I was able to complete the song. So I\u2019m kind of shocked. What I\u2019m not going to do is run away. I really want to run out of the stadium right now, but I\u2019m not going to do that. I\u2019m going to finish this song.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Platten also took to social media to apologize for the flub.
