It\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d the actress recalled of the pre-surgery conversation.\n\n\u201cAnd it was hard,\u201d said Raisa, who added: \u201cSelena and I both went through a depression.\u201d\n\nAlso in the on-camera interview, Raisa walked fans through the steps of the transplant as she had the button on her jeans undone to show her \u201cC-section scar\u201d and the marks on her stomach area.\n\nSELF\n\n\u201cYour scars don\u2019t define you. It\u2019s a part of your story. It\u2019s a part of the story that makes you special and you different,\u201d she emphasized as she also noted that Gomez has a scar on the inside of her leg due to an emergency surgery following the transplant.\n\nGomez shocked fans in September 2017 when she announced that, due to complications of the autoimmune disease lupus, she had received a kidney transplant from Raisa over the summer.\n\n\u201cRecovery was hard,\u201d Raisa said in an interview with W Magazine earlier this month. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to eat, I didn\u2019t want to drink anything.\u201d\n\nJon Kopaloff/FilmMagic\n\nIn February, Raisa told Harry Connick Jr. that she was \u201cunable to move for two months\u201d post-op.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything active. All I could do was walk. That was very hard for me, and I have a dog. Every day the thing I look forward to is drinking my coffee and walking, and I couldn\u2019t do that. It was really, really hard,\u201d she said during her appearance on his daytime talk show Harry.Watch this video on The Scene.\n\nGomez continues to be open about her battle with lupus after first revealing in 2015 that she\u2019d undergone chemotherapy to treat the disease.\n\nLupus causes the immune system to attack its own organs and tissues and can affect the whole body. According to the Lupus Foundation of America, about half of all cases of systemic lupus affect a major organ such as the heart, lung, kidneys or brain. In some cases, it can take years for the disease to be diagnosed and properly treated.", "images":
