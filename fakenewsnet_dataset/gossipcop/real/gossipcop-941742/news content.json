Shortly after being first contacted by the EPA three years ago, Magnolia Homes took immediate steps to bring its activities into compliance with [the Toxic Substances Control Act],\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, to take its commitment a step further, Magnolia Homes made the decision to implement a compliance management program in which it adopted an enhanced renovation record-keeping checklist for use by Magnolia Homes staff and subcontractors,\u201d the Magnolia statement continued.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

our community and our industry.\u201d\n\nThe last episode from the fifth and final season of Fixer Upper aired in April.", "images":
