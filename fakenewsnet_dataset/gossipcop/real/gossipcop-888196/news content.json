Growing up there was no reflection of me anywhere, not on TV, not in movies, not in music, and it was as if someone like me didn\u2019t exist in American mainstream.\u201d\n\nTommaso Boddi/WireImage via Getty\n\n\u201cThat all changed when a bright, young singer named Selena came and changed the landscape of music entertainment,\u201d Longoria said.\n\nSuzette helped in the preparation of her sister\u2019s star, and spoke as she accepted the award in honor of her sister and family.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve crossed different generations. We\u2019re now in a whole new generation of millennials and I\u2019m very grateful on behalf of my family and myself for them embracing her and finding her,\u201d Suzette said. \u201cI want to keep this short and sweet. I want to thank my parents, especially my father for having that vision and being able to guide us throughout our whole career and for teaching us that we can succeed as long as we put in hard work. I hope that sets the example for all of our youth that\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Selena said it best, \u2018The impossible is possible.'\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you with this, Selena said, \u2018The goal isn\u2019t to live forever, but to create something that will.\u2019 And I think tonight is a perfect testament of that.\u201d\n\nThe late singer\u2019s husband, Perez, laid white roses over her star. On Thursday night, he stopped by the concealed star on Hollywood Boulevard, captioning a photo on Instagram with, \u201cHad to stop by, give a kiss, and say, \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\u201d\n\nQuintanilla was murdered in a motel in her hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1995 by Yolanda Saldivar, who worked as a manger of the singer\u2019s clothing boutiques.\n\nThe star is a culmination of a busy year for the deceased singer. A MAC Cosmetics line inspired by her signature looks was created, once again proving her legacy was alive in 21st century pop culture.\n\nGoogle created a Doodle on it\u2019s search bar in her honor in October, while wax replicas of her exist in Madame Tussauds in Hollywood and New York City.", "images":
