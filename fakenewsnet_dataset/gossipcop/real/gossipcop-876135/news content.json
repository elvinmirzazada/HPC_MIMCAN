I'll be good tonight I promise ... @vmas,\" she wrote.\n\nMiley's infamous performance marked one of the most controversial ones ever seen at the VMAs, coming at a time when she started to project a sexier image after years of starring on the Disney Channel's Hannah Montana.\n\nRight after the infamous performance, some people criticized her dad over his parenting skills, after which he tweeted, \"Thanking God for so many blessings tonight. Continue to pray for world peace. More love ...less hate.\"\n\nShortly after, the 56-year-old talked about his daughter's performance on Piers Morgan Tonight.\n\n\"I think she could've went out and sang the song in a flannel shirt and a pair of jeans, and it would have still been just as strong,\" he said.\n\n\"Would we have been here talking about it? No way.\"\n\nMiley returned to the VMAs stage in 2014 and 2015, when she hosted the ceremony.\n\nShe is set to perform at the 2017 MTV VMAs, which air live from the Forum in Los Angeles on MTV, Monday at 1 p.m local time.", "images": ["https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/x_FK5nHHjmcJfxbrzx2bG9PonRo=/0x285:1080x892/88x88/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F4adc5a4f-6f03-4630-868a-6271a6e90eb9", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/-PiJ7Typk7E3YT_9FzDieAy0CWc=/396x223/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FNetwork%2FImages%2Faftermiley.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/ppQZ7C8LIfsz8b8odbK2forTzjU=/88x88/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F15de6261-abd8-4404-aaa5-5322dc80eb00", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/Jr-tfmRkJIUZmKuevG21WwmloIk=/0x767:1440x1577/88x88/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F8654f0da-b658-422a-86bf-0a4d84e8b64a", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/Ss-xlOhH9ovpsdZoeclXPOLK0IY=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2Fnetwork%2Fimages%2F2017%2F08%2F28%2F06%2F58%2Fmileycyrusfix2808_2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/Ss-xlOhH9ovpsdZoeclXPOLK0IY=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2Fnetwork%2Fimages%2F2017%2F08%2F28%2F06%2F58%2Fmileycyrusfix2808_2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "//celebrity.nine.com.au/latest/miley-cyrus-teases-billy-ray-cyrus-vma/ce25ab21-a1cb-4bc6-a3d4-9523e7ce1f61", "title": "Miley Cyrus teases dad Billy Ray with MTV VMAs flashback before 2017 show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00daa7", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/imgs/celebrity/ms-icon-144x144.f93a8f07.png", "theme-color": "#00daa7", "nine": {"video-player": {"nielsen-plugin": "{\"apid\":\"P366BEB07-2E11-4EE0-B65B-0E24519B7560\",\"sfcode\":\"dcr\",\"nsdkv\":\"511,\",\"apn\":\"nineFix\",\"section\":\"nine.com.au Honey - Celebrity\",\"segA\":\"\",\"custom_fields\":{\"hasAds\":1,\"program\":\"nine.com.au Honey Celebrity\"},\"vcid\":\"c144\"}", "video-params": {"ad-unit": "celebrity/latest", "video-name-prefix": "celebrity|Latest|", "page-name": "entertainment:celebrity:latest:article-Miley Cyrus teases dad Billy Ray with MTV VMAs flashback before 2017 show"}, "granularTracking": {"pageTemplate": "article"}, "content-id": "ce25ab21-a1cb-4bc6-a3d4-9523e7ce1f61", "page-levels": "{\"pagelevel01\":\"celebrity\",\"pagelevel02\":\"latest\",\"pagelevel03\":\"\",\"pagelevel04\":\"\"}", "page-type": "article"}}, "ninemsn": {"id": "ce25ab21-a1cb-4bc6-a3d4-9523e7ce1f61"}, "description": "\"I'll be good tonight I promise\"", "og": {"type": "website", "title": "Miley Cyrus teases dad Billy Ray with MTV VMAs flashback before 2017 show", "description": "\"I'll be good tonight I promise\"", "image": "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/Ss-xlOhH9ovpsdZoeclXPOLK0IY=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2Fnetwork%2Fimages%2F2017%2F08%2F28%2F06%2F58%2Fmileycyrusfix2808_2.jpg", "url": "//celebrity.nine.com.au/latest/miley-cyrus-teases-billy-ray-cyrus-vma/ce25ab21-a1cb-4bc6-a3d4-9523e7ce1f61"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@9HoneyAU", "title": "Miley Cyrus teases dad Billy Ray with MTV VMAs flashback before 2017 show", "description": "\"I'll be good tonight I promise\"", "image": "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/Ss-xlOhH9ovpsdZoeclXPOLK0IY=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2Fnetwork%2Fimages%2F2017%2F08%2F28%2F06%2F58%2Fmileycyrusfix2808_2.jpg"}, "position": 4}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503867600.0, "source": "https://celebrity.nine.com.au", "summary": ""}
