She looked incredible, and she knew it\u2014and refused to hear anything otherwise.\n\nShe wore the custom Jane Doe Latex dress to present the award for Best Duo alongside her costar, Milo Ventimiglia, and clearly upstaged him:\n\nAnd that was even after she changed into a gorgeous blue dress for the Beauty and the Beast-themed opening number. Changing in and out of latex quickly? That deserves its own award.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBut apparently, not everybody was too happy with Metz\u2019s look, and snarked about her size online. But Metz has never had time for body shaming, and always promotes positivity no matter what your size. After the awards show wrapped, she went on Twitter and responded to the body shamers. \u201cFor the record, I wear what I want, when I want,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNews flash it\u2019s MY body. #thankstho.\u201d\n\nThose are words to live by\u2014and hardly the first time she\u2019s spoken out about feeling comfortable in her own skin. \"Size doesn't equate to beauty. I don't understand why that's a thing,\u201d she told Marie Claire back in March. \u201cWell, I do, because the media has told us thin is beautiful. But is it?\u201d", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/787dcfa8-029c-4ade-acab-5650f77a019f.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=160:*",
