I'm not afraid to say that,\" the reality star told Us Weekly.\n\nDavid Crotty / Patrick McMullan/Getty Image The couple stepped out at the MTV Movie and TV Awards during happier times in their relationship.\n\n\"My friends, my family and Vanessa and I are still very much each other's support system,\" Viall continued. \"We're trying to do that and it's a challenge at times, but we still realize that we're there for each other.\"\n\nHe also mentioned the mental toll the split has taken.\n\n\"It's obviously easy to get insecure and feel bad about yourself,\" he said. \"You get in your head about things when things aren't working out for you.\"\n\nFor Viall, leaning on friends has been important during a difficult time.\n\n\"In times that aren't great, you have to kind of spend time with your loved ones,\" Viall told the magazine. \"I'm trying to stay positive, being around friends and family. It helps me stay positive.\"\n\nIt's okay to feel broken. It's okay to cry. It's okay to lean on a friend. In the end, it will always be okay.
