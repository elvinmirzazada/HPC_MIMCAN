{"url": "https://people.com/tv/kaya-scodelario-opens-up-sexual-assault-age-12/", "text": "Kaya Scodelario is opening up about the alleged sexual assault she suffered at the young age of 12.\n\nScodelario, 25, partook in the #MeToo movement in October when she joined the outpouring of women who bravely came forward with their own personal stories about sexual assault and harassment. (The phrase began trending after Alyssa Milano tweeted it.)\n\nAt the time, the Skins actress \u2014 she played Effy Stonem on the seven-season drama (2007-13) \u2014 revealed that it took her 13 years to share her story, and that she did so for her son.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken me 13 years to say #MeToo.He is still protected by \u2018family members\u2019 in Brazil. They\u2019ve told lies to papers to try to silence me,\u201dshe tweeted. \u201cTo finally speak out and not be afraid. To everyone still suffering silently, you never asked for it. NOBODY DOES. I do this for my son. So that he will see one day that we all have a voice. And that this behavior can not be tolerated any longer.\u201d\n\nWhile Scodelario \u2014 who shares a 13-month-old son with husband Benjamin Walker \u2014 said in a recent interview with Metro.Co.UK that the \u201cresponse was wonderful,\u201d she is hopeful her story doesn\u2019t \u201cdefine\u201d her in the future.\n\n\u201cI am now dealing with a new side of it, which is this,\u201d she said. \u201cI will be asked about it forever now. I hope it doesn\u2019t define me but it will always be under my name and I accept that \u2013 but I am proud I was brave enough to do it and I am grateful for the support I had from friends.\u201d\n\nThe Maze Runner star said that her 12-year-old self came to mind when she chose to share her experience.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking that if I was 12-years-old and I had this horrific thing happen to me but I saw a woman I admired speaking up about it, it would have made me feel less guilty, and it would have inspired me to think \u2018this won\u2019t hold me back, this is something that has happened but I am not a victim,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo I thought if I can do that for one person then I owe it to my 12-year-old self,\u201d she added.\n\nMatt Crossick/PA Images/Getty\n\nEarlier this month, actress Michelle Williams brought #MeToo founder Tarana Burke to the Golden Globes and opened up about navigating the uncertain times to help create a better world for the next generation, including her own 12-year-old daughter, Matilda Rose Ledger.\n\n\u201cI thought I would have to raise my daughter to learn how to protect herself in a dangerous world, but I think the work that Tarana has done and the work that I\u2019m learning how to do \u2014 we actually have the opportunity to hand our children a different world,\u201d Williams, 37, said on the E! red carpet pre-show. \u201cI am honored beyond measure to be standing next to this woman. I have tears in my eyes and smile on my face.\u201d\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page. Learn more about Time\u2019s Up, an organization of women in entertainment combating sexual harassment and inequality, on its website.\n\nBurke echoed Williams\u2019s sentiment and talked about the beginnings of the #MeToo movement, which spread all over social media as women spoke out against the sexual harassment they face in everyday life.\n\n\u201cThis is something I started out of necessary and something my community needed, and it\u2019s grown this year and I couldn\u2019t have imagined it growing like this,\u201d Burke said. \u201cBut this moment is so powerful because there is collaboration between these two worlds that people don\u2019t put together. It\u2019s really powerful to be on the red carpet tonight and people like Michelle to give up her time to talk about our causes.\u201d", "images":
