I\u2019m in a great place, a great mature place where all I do is spread positivity. If you\u2019re not doing that, you\u2019re not on my page.\u201d\n\nHours later, Hart took to Instagram again to reveal the Academy had asked him to issue an apology \u2014 which he refused to do.\n\n\u201cSo, I just got a call from the Academy and that call basically said, \u2018Kevin, apologize for your tweets\u2026 or we\u2019re going to have to move on and find another host,\u2019\u201d he said in a video shared on Instagram that he captioned \u201cI know who I am and so do the people closest to me. I\u2019m not going to continue to go back and tap into the days of old when I\u2019ve moved on and I\u2019m in a completely different space in my life.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it, man. I\u2019m going to be me and stand my ground.\u201d\n\nA source familiar with the situation confirmed to PEOPLE that the Academy did ask Hart to apologize.\n\nKevin Hart touches down in Sydney, Australia, on a private jet. MEGA\n\nStepping Down as Oscars Host \u2014 and an Apology\n\nJust an hour after he refused to apologize, the comedian shared he would be stepping down as Oscars host.\n\n\u201cI have made the choice to step down from hosting this year\u2019s Oscars\u2019s,\u201d Hart tweeted .\u201dThis is because I do not want to be a distraction on a night that should be celebrated by so many amazing talented artists. I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past.\u201d\n\nIn a second tweet, Hart finally issued an apology, writing, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I hurt people.. I am evolving and want to continue to do so. My goal is to bring people together not tear us apart. Much love & appreciation to the Academy. I hope we can meet again.\u201d\n\nThe Academy has not commented on the reaction to Hart\u2019s casting as host nor on his revelation that they asked for him to apologize.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kevin Hart Reveals How Wife Eniko Forgave Him After Cheating Scandal: She\u2019s \u2018My Backbone\u2019\n\nDefending a Cowboys-and-Indians-Themed Birthday Party\n\nBefore stepping down as Oscars host, Hart and his wife were under fire for planning their son Kenzo\u2019s first birthday party with a cowboys-and-Indians theme \u2014 which some critics viewed as cultural appropriation.\n\n\u201cZos cowboys & indians party was nothing but amazing!\u201d Eniko captioned an Instagram photo of the celebration, which was decorated with Native American blankets, cowboy hats and teepees.\n\nDays after his son\u2019s party, Hart addressed the controversy and defended the theme on his SiriusXM show Straight from The Hart saying the backlash was \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nHart also explained that the premise of the party\u2019s theme was based on western movies and the couple\u2019s intentions were not malicious.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying the battle that is \u2018assumed\u2019 because of the movies and because of everything they\u2019ve seen, was because of the fights that were between the cowboys and the Indians,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a racial slur that people are doing and being malicious with. This is a game that\u2019s been played for years,\u201d Hart added.\n\nAftermath of a Cheating Scandal\n\nIn 2017, a close friend of Hart\u2019s allegedly tried to extort him over a video of him with another woman. The actor opened up weathering the storm of his cheating scandal to PEOPLE in September saying the friendship he has with his wife \u201cis insane.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s my wife, we\u2019re lovers, it\u2019s a relationship, it\u2019s marriage\u2026but the friendship we have is like no other,\u201d he shared. \u201cOur marriage has been put to the test,\u201d alluding to his infidelity scandal. \u201cIt\u2019s the most difficult test ever. And, you know, sometimes those tests come from stupidity. But it\u2019s how you handle it, and how you decide to move forward from it.\u201d\n\nFor Eniko\u2019s part, she chose full-fledged forgiveness. \u201cI applaud my wife for just displaying a high level of strength that I can\u2019t even explain,\u201d says Hart. \u201cI applaud her for being my backbone, my support system, and more importantly, taking my life to the next level.\u201d",
