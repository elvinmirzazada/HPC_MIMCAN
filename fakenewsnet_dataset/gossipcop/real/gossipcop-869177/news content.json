People have wanted KJ and I to be together. People have wanted every actor on this show to be in a union that they could make real. Truthfully, it\u2019s very pleasing that people talk about Lili and I in that way because it means that we\u2019re resonating so strongly that people really want that to be true,\u201d Cole added.\n\nOctober 17, 2017\n\nJust another gorgeous shot of Lili snapped by Cole.\n\n410 A post shared by Cole Sprouse (@colesprouse) on Oct 17, 2017 at 4:08pm PDT\n\nHe captioned this one \"410,\" which was pretty mysterious to fans.

But he won't deny it either!\n\n\"Whether you dismiss those rumors or whether you encourage those rumors, it\u2019s giving people who are, in my opinion, a bit entitled to your personal life more power,\" Cole explained to the mag.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\"You have to have spaces for reverence in the industry,\" he continued. \"The more you let people in on that, the more people feel entitled to it and the more it becomes problematic with whoever you end up being with in the future, so I take that very seriously. So I just never talk about it because it\u2019s not anyone\u2019s right to know.\"\n\n\n\nBut Cole knows that fans are bound to continue speculating whether he confirms his relationships or not and he's okay with that. \"People can speculate all they want,\" he said. \"People speculate about me with every member of the cast practically, but it\u2019s really no one\u2019s right to know. It\u2019s also sexy, these parts of the relationships that are just yours.\"\n\nDecember 19, 2018\n\nThe pair won't confirm their relationship, but they will gush about each other on Instagram. For example, Lili couldn't even begin to handle how adorable Cole was on Friends as a child.\n\nJanuary 1, 2018\n\nCole and Lili spend New Years together in Hawaii.

I understand the interest, but it\u2019s called a private life for a reason. And it\u2019s not something that I owe the world.\"\n\nLili thinks people are bound to speculate over every one of her relationships, so why bother addressing any of it?\n\n\u201cPeople are going to say anything and everything. They\u2019re going to say that I love KJ, they\u2019re gonna say that I love Cami, and they\u2019re gonna say that I love Cole: it\u2019s inevitable,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not at a point in my life where I\u2019m ready to openly confirm, deny, or talk about a relationship that I\u2019m in, because I think it\u2019s brutal to have a relationship in the spotlight where I can be scrutinized by anyone and everyone.\u201d\n\nFebruary 1, 2018\n\nLili told Ocean Drive that Cole is a calming force in her life as she deals with the stressful nature of fame.\n\n\u201cHe really brings us down to earth if we\u2019re feeling like something we\u2019ve said is being taken out of context,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s always the one to be like, \u2018Just ignore it. It will blow over.\u2019 It\u2019s a nice, calming energy he has because you know that he\u2019s been through it.\u201d\n\nNoelle Devoe is the Entertainment Editor at Seventeen.com.
