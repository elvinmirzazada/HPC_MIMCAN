News about the public\u2019s immediate reaction to claims of sexual misconduct on set after an alleged hot and heavy hookup between himself and Olympios.\n\nRelated: Biggest Reality TV Villains Ever! Look back at some of the biggest villains who wreaked havoc in shows like \u2018Survivor,\u2019 \u2018The Bachelor,\u2019 \u2018Big Brother\u2019 and the \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 franchise!\n\n\u201cThe minute you release this black man\u2019s face and this white girl\u2019s face, before either of us commented on it, I was already a \u2018rapist,\u2019\u201d the 30-year-old explained to E! News, adding that Olympios was labeled a \u201cwhore\u201d and \u201cslut.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were slut-shaming her because of what she did last season with Nick [Viall]. For me, it goes back to the human race. We failed,\u201d the contestant, who appeared on Rachel Lindsay\u2019s season 13 of Bachelorette, said. (Olympios previously got topless on Viall\u2019s season 21 of The Bachelor and encouraged him to touch her bare breasts as cameras rolled.)\n\nJackson also claims she was the \u201caggressor\u201d during the night of their poolside encounter. \u201cShe gets up out of the pool and puts her lady parts in my face. Like, right on my face,\u201d he claimed to E! News. \u201cI don\u2019t think any single man \u2014 some married ones \u2014 would turn down Corinne.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 Season 4 Cast Revealed: Find Out Who\u2019s Heading to Mexico to Find Love!
