But her health and well-being must be put before all else,\" a show rep tells PEOPLE. \"Wendy has been openly dealing with her Graves' Disease for many years in addition to hyperthyroidism. Yesterday, Wendy's doctor prescribed a necessary three weeks of rest to get her levels and medication in sync. The show will be in repeats during this unplanned hiatus. A live show was produced today so that Wendy could speak directly to her fans and explain her condition.\"\n\nAfter canceling an appointment with her endocrinologist scheduled for December in favor of a business meeting, Williams finally saw the doctor on Tuesday.\n\n\"My doctor has prescribed \u2014 are you ready? \u2014 as of today, three weeks of vacation,\" she announced. \"What? Who are you? I was pissed.\"\n\nThe TV personality joked, \"I'll be back in two. I'm not an heiress \u2014 who is going to pay my bills? Are you serious? I'm just saying, I come from working class.\"\n\nWilliams also had an important message to women to put their health first.\n\n\"What I want to say to women, more than men, is stop putting everyone first because if we're not good, they're not good,\" she said.\n\nThe announcement comes after Williams canceled several shows last week because she was experiencing \"flu-ish\" symptoms, she said in an Instagram post last Wednesday.\n\n\"I do go to the doctors today to find out what exactly it is,\" she explained. \"I feel awful. I had to be talked out of going to work today and taking off a few days to get myself together.\"\n\nThe talk show host also fainted during a live broadcast of her show on Halloween, which she attributed to feeling \"overheated\" in her elaborate Statue of Liberty costume. The broadcast quickly cut to commercial, and Williams continued the show when they returned.\n\nThe day after the incident, Williams recounted the collapse to her studio audience.\n\n\"It was scary,\" she recalled, choking up. \"It was really scary. It was so scary, all I could think of in the middle of the scare was, 'Don't pull the podium over on you, because that'll make it worse.'\"\n\nAfter closing out the show, paramedics informed her she was low on electrolytes.\n\n\"My blood pressure was fine, my heart rate was fine, everything was fine,\" she said. \"I'm a 53-year-old middle-aged woman going through what middle-aged women go through, if you know what I mean. The costume got hot. Right before passing out, I felt like I was in the middle of a campfire.\"\n\nThe Wendy Williams Show airs weekdays (check local listings).", "images":
