It\u2019s really great.\u201d\n\nAndrew Carlile/MEGA\n\nRobert\u2019s enthusiasm for the natural world around him is something that he has inherited from his family, including mom Terri and big sister Bindi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just in my blood,\u201d he said. \u201cI actually grew up at Australia Zoo, so I think I\u2019m the luckiest kid on planet Earth.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Bindi Irwin Pays Tearful Tribute to Her Late Father Steve Irwin on \u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE in 2017, Bindi opened up about the closeness of her family and the lasting impact her father made on the world.\n\n\u201cFor us as a family, dad was the greatest dad on the planet, first of all. He was truly the ultimate wildlife warrior. Dad was amazing because he left this legacy that people will never forget. He didn\u2019t just say to love the cute and cuddly animals \u2013 he tried to get people to understand and respect the animals like crocodiles and snakes and really break down those barriers,\u201d she shared.\n\n\u201cI have a beautiful family at Australia Zoo of staff that takes care of all our gorgeous animals. And I think that my greatest achievement is really having the sweetest and most awesome family,\u201d said Bindi. \u201cI\u2019m really blessed and I count my blessings every single day to have them. for us, it\u2019s nice that we share everything with all of our wildlife work and our traveling work. We\u2019re just a little family no matter what.\u201d", "images":
