Upon seeing the cover photo, Nyong'o spoke out against the publication in a lengthy caption.\n\n\"As I have made clear so often in the past with every fiber of my being, I embrace my natural heritage and despite having grown up thinking light skin and straight, silky hair were the standards of beauty, I now know that my dark skin and kinky, coily hair are beautiful too,\" she began. \"Being featured on the cover of a magazine fulfills me as it is an opportunity to show other dark, kinky-haired people, and particularly our children, that they are beautiful just the way they are.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old actress goes on to slam Grazia for photoshopping the image without asking her permission. \"I am disappointed that @graziauk invited me to be on their cover and then edited out and smoothed my hair to fit their notion of what beautiful hair looks like,\" she continued. \"Had I been consulted, I would have explained that I cannot support or condone the omission of what is my native heritage.\"\n\nNyong'o concluded her post by noting that there is \"still a very long way to go to combat the unconscious prejudice against black women's complexion, hair style and texture.\"\n\nThe Star Wars: The Force Awakens star has made it her mission to change how the world views beauty.\n\n\"European standards of beauty are something that plague the entire world -- the idea that darker skin is not beautiful, that light skin is the key to success and love,\" she told Glamour magazine in 2014. \"I remember seeing a commercial where a woman goes for an interview and doesn't get the job. Then she puts a cream on her face to lighten her skin, and she gets the job! This is the message: that dark skin is unacceptable.\"\n\nShe added, \"Beautiful people have many advantages, but so do friendly people. I think beauty is an expression of love.\"", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-04%2F1280_lupita_nyongo_GettyImages519152176.jpg%3Fh%3D6b3ccd88&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2013-10/set_lupita_nyongo_180006428_lbusacca.jpg?width=640", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/lupita_nyongo_695791704.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-06%2F1280_lupita.jpg&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/lupita_nyongo_695791704.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/lupita-nyongo-slams-magazine-retouching-her-hair-i-embrace-my-natural-heritage-90840", "title": "Lupita Nyong'o Slams Magazine for Retouching Her Hair: 'I Embrace My Natural Heritage'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/lupita_nyongo_695791704.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "\"I cannot support or condone the omission of what is my native heritage.\"", "title": "Lupita Nyong'o Slams Magazine for Retouching Her Hair: 'I Embrace My Natural Heritage'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/lupita-nyongo-slams-magazine-retouching-her-hair-i-embrace-my-natural-heritage-90840", "type": "Article"}, "description": "\"I cannot support or condone the omission of what is my native heritage.\"", "twitter": {"description": "\"I cannot support or condone the omission of what is my native heritage.\"", "title": "Lupita Nyong'o Slams Magazine for Retouching Her Hair: 'I Embrace My Natural Heritage'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/lupita-nyongo-slams-magazine-retouching-her-hair-i-embrace-my-natural-heritage-90840", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/lupita_nyongo_695791704.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Lupita Nyong'o Slams Magazine for Retouching Her Hair: 'I Embrace My Natural Heritage' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Fashion, News, Lupita Nyong'o", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 42, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
