But Chrissy Teigen? She\u2019ll be there, closing out the show\u2026 at least, in her mind.\n\nThe 31-year-old model and cookbook author spent Saturday telling fans that she was in China for Sunday\u2019s big show \u2014 a joke, considering she\u2019s not one of the confirmed participants at the event and was sharing videos of herself cooking dinner for hubby John Legend and friends at their Los Angeles home Friday night.\n\n\u201cHey guys, I\u2019m in Shanghai, getting ready for the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion show,\u201d Teigen said in an Instagram Stories video posted early Saturday morning, while wearing pajamas and a matching robe, playing with her 1-year-old daughter Luna, and sitting on her couch with her with mom Vilailuck and bulldog Puddy. \u201cI\u2019m nervous, but I think I\u2019m gonna kill it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing to try to get one last gym session in,\u201d she said, showing a collection of syrup bottles she had used for breakfast. \u201cGotta look sick! Closing the show!\u201d\n\nShe continued the gag later, zooming in on flower arrangements she had around the house.\n\n\u201cHey guys, here in Shanghai. Thank you so much for the flowers. VS baby, for life!\u201d she said showing one, later adding of another: \u201cGisele B\u00fcndchen and Justin Bieber just sent me these to congratulate me on the show. All they\u2019re doing is making me nervous though. I\u2019m so nervous!\u201d\n\nLater, after a shower, she joked that she had \u201cjust finished\u201d a \u201cworkout sesh\u201d and was \u201cdoing a lot of ab work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sweating as you can see from it. I go hard,\u201d she said.\n\nChrissy Teigen/instagram\n\nFans took notice, one user tweeting, \u201c@chrissyteigen\u2019s troll level of the VS fashion show this morning is giving me life #mostlyabwork #VSFS2017.\u201d\n\nBut Teigen wasn\u2019t giving up the gag, writing, \u201cNo one is answering my phone calls or emails but I am here in Shanghai and ready for my fitting !!!!!!\u201d\n\nThe Lip Sync Battle host then asked fans to Photoshop her into a photo of Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show 2017 models in Shanghai that was shared on the company\u2019s Instagram page, which they were happy to do. Teigen retweeted some of her favorites.\n\nWhile Teigen won\u2019t make it to the big show, 55 models including Karlie Kloss, Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, Candice Swanepoel, Stella Maxwell, Elsa Hosk, Jasmine Tookes, Josephine Skriver, Lais Ribeiro, Martha Hunt, Romee Strijd, Sara Sampaio, and Taylor Hill will be.\n\nThis year\u2019s Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show is set to be bigger than ever before. And that\u2019s why the lingerie giant has cast four musical performers to hit the stage in Shanghai, China, alongside some of the world\u2019s most famous models.\n\n\u201cWe started booking our musical guests months ago when Harry Styles, international superstar, signed on,\u201d Ed Razek, executive producer of the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show and chief creative officer at Victoria\u2019s Secret, told PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cAlso appearing are Grammy award-winning artist Miguel, Tony award-winning star of Hamilton Leslie Odom Jr., and Chinese sensation Jane Zhang. We are incredibly thrilled to have them with us.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Lais Ribeiro Wears Victoria\u2019s Secret Fantasy Bra This Year\n\nAs for those reports about Gigi, Razek said the road to Shanghai and the welcome in China has been a harmonious one.\n\n\u201cThe news reports I\u2019ve been reading from the US here in Shanghai regarding this year\u2019s Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show are not an accurate reflection of what I\u2019m seeing and experiencing on site,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Chinese have been wonderful and enthusiastic hosts and partners. From granting more than 700 visas, collaborating with us on every detail and introducing us to local experts who have helped us elevate our event in this renowned fashion city. We appreciate their efforts and all they have done to make this event a success. We look forward to the live show Monday night and the international broadcast a week later.\u201d\n\nThe Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show airs Tuesday, November 28, at 10 p.m. on CBS.", "images":
