And I immediately started sobbing on the plane,\" Kendall said of her hardest day to work over the last 10 years. \"Then I got the next text came through, saying, 'OK, actually, he's OK, but he's not doing well.' So that's why I was so upset, because I wanted to be there to say goodbye.\"\n\n\"On the plane, they said he died,\" shared Khloe, who put her divorce from Odom on hold to care for him after his hospitalization. \"Someone faked it.\"\n\n\"I was screaming,\" she continued. \"But to think, and to go through the motions as if someone has passed away is the most traumatic thing to do, and then to know they're really alive... it was too many emotions, I think, for any of us to handle.\"\n\nKhloe and Lamar's divorce was finalized in December 2016, months after she started dating Cleveland Cavaliers star Tristan Thompson.\n\n\"I kind of have a type, I guess,\" Khloe confessed in another promo. \"I don't know what that is, but I was put on a blind date with Tristan, and that's how I met Tristan.\"\n\n\"I was at the Bel-Air Hotel. He came to the dinner... I had a bunch of people and Brandon Jennings brought him, and we just connected,\" Khloe recalled. \"It's a serious relationship.\"\n\n\"It's a level five,\" Kourtney interjected. \"[Out of] six.\"\n\nSee more on Khloe's relationship with Thompson in the video below.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-05/1280_Khloe_Kardashian_denisetruscello.JPG?h=877cb4ef", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2Fscott_disick_450148290.jpg%3Fh%3Dc673cd1c&w=256&q=75", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F1280x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2016-05%2F1280_Khloe_Kardashian_denisetruscello.JPG%3Fh%3D877cb4ef&w=1024&q=100", "https://www.etonline.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etonline.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F720x720%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017-09%2Fkhloe_kardashian_kim_kardashian_gettyimages_683393560.jpg%3Fh%3Dd84a19c6&w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-05/1280_Khloe_Kardashian_denisetruscello.JPG?h=877cb4ef", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-says-thinking-lamar-odom-had-died-was-most-traumatic-experience-i-was-screaming", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Says Thinking Lamar Odom Had Died Was the 'Most Traumatic' Experience: 'I Was Screaming'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-05/1280_Khloe_Kardashian_denisetruscello.JPG?h=877cb4ef", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The reality star also opens up about her relationship with Tristan Thompson in 'KUWTK's 10th Anniversary Special.", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Says Thinking Lamar Odom Had Died Was the 'Most Traumatic' Experience: 'I Was Screaming'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-says-thinking-lamar-odom-had-died-was-most-traumatic-experience-i-was-screaming", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The reality star also opens up about her relationship with Tristan Thompson in 'KUWTK's 10th Anniversary Special.", "twitter": {"description": "The reality star also opens up about her relationship with Tristan Thompson in 'KUWTK's 10th Anniversary Special.", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Says Thinking Lamar Odom Had Died Was the 'Most Traumatic' Experience: 'I Was Screaming'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/khloe-kardashian-says-thinking-lamar-odom-had-died-was-most-traumatic-experience-i-was-screaming", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-05/1280_Khloe_Kardashian_denisetruscello.JPG?h=877cb4ef", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Khloe Kardashian Says Thinking Lamar Odom Had Died Was the 'Most Traumatic' Experience: 'I Was Screaming' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Khloe Kardashian, Lamar Odom, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 43, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
