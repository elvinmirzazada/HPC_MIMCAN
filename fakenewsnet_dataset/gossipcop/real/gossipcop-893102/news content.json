{"url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-fashion-reputation-music-videos", "text": "As with any project she's attached to, the premiere of Taylor Swift's \"Ready For It\" music video was preceded by heated anticipation, excited countdowns, and countless fan theories. The cyborg-showdown depicted in the three and a half-minute clip only unleashed more speculation concerning the \"hidden meanings\" she may or may not be folding into the work released during this Reputation era. (Why is \u201c8919\u201d written on the wall? Who are all of those robots? How many Joe Alwyn references are there, really?) All of these musings largely go back to how Swift presents herself because, on top of a new sound, she's got a brand-new aesthetic to go with it.\n\nAmid all of the action in the \"Ready For It\" video, the implications of her Blade Runner-esque costume can be overlooked\u2014after all, she seemingly appeared nude in all the teasers for the clip, which obviously diverted the conversation slightly. But lo and behold, the futuristic storyline did provide some key fashion moments that indicate larger shift in how Swift uses clothing (or the lack thereof) to usher in the latest chapter of her career\u2014and, of course, how this all shapes her reputation.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33d37f67f7204bb561a6f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-our-song-dress.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33ca5558b186fd1bcdc75/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-music-video-01.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f398b55b645f2e900dd968/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/two-taylors-ready-for-it.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f397ecd945514f9f01d824/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-ready-for-it-social.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33ccc5b645f2e900dd93b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/13-taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-screenshot-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33c695b645f2e900dd939/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Reputation-Taylor-Swift.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33dffd60b30611849af5d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/07-taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-screenshot-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33d66ad714a335821fcd8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-you-belong-with-me-dress.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/65159927af8cae32202cbfc6/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/654659f1955b8f8cffea1eb4/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/64cd37f7f2d4984422dd4ba1/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f397d85b645f2e900dd966/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-ready-for-it-lede-image.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33db8f67f7204bb561a71/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/rehost-2016-9-13-78ce6871-4ba2-46e3-a49f-43416088e61f.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33cf7ad714a335821fcd6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/06-taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-screenshot-2017-billboard-1548.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/652006a8025105de951ae2dd/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33ddbad714a335821fcda/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/o-BAD-BLOOD-facebook.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/654040864afaa836d66bc640/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.svg?v=1", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_800%2Cq_80%2Cw_800/v1506636472/glamour_14-facts-about-cardi-b.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6564d2808e843e41a3d82eeb/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f3986a8c6db22bfab3de41/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-ready-for-it-outfit-shot-1.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f33d945b645f2e900dd93d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-10-25%2520at%25204.30.13%2520PM.png"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f397ecd945514f9f01d824/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-ready-for-it-social.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Halie Lesavage", "September"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-fashion-reputation-music-videos", "title": "How Taylor Swift is Counting on Fashion to Change Her 'Reputation'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "Taylor Swift has adopted a distinct look with each phase in her career.
