(The couple share son Benjamin Rein, 8, and daughter Vivian Lake, 5, while Brady is also dad to John \u201cJack\u201d Edward Thomas, 10, from a previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan.)\n\nThe supermodel reportedly explained to the children that the Eagles hadn\u2019t won in a long time. \u201cThey haven\u2019t won in a million years,\u201d she allegedly said to console them.\n\nVivian then reportedly blurted out, \u201cThe Eagles won the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust this time. Daddy won five times. They never won before,\u201d B\u00fcndchen reportedly replied. \u201cTheir whole life, they never won a Super Bowl. You have to let someone else win sometimes. We have to share. Sharing is caring.\u201d\n\nAfter B\u00fcndchen was faced with backlash, she took to Twitter on Wednesday to clarify her remarks.\n\n\u201cJust to be clear. No one \u2018let\u2019 anyone win. People win because of their own merit,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTired of people twisting my words to create drama that doesn\u2019t exist!\u201d\n\nB\u00fcndchen congratulated the Eagles for their victory after they clinched the title with a score of 41-33.\n\n\u201cCongratulations Eagles for winning the Super bowl, what a game that was!\u201d wrote B\u00fcndchen on Instagram.\n\nShe continued, \u201cCongratulations Patriots for giving your best and to my love, we are incredibly proud of you because we are able to see every day all the commitment, sacrifice and hard work that you have devoted to become the best in what you do. We love you!\u201d\n\nIn the accompanying photo, Brady appeared emotional as he hugged his wife and one of their children.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that B\u00fcndchen has been pushing Brady to retire, but a source close to the couple tells PEOPLE, \u201cGisele always supports Tom no matter what.\u201d\n\nThough the source adds that \u201cnobody really knows what\u2019s next for him now,\u201d it\u2019s likely Brady won\u2019t be retiring.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Tom Brady Hangs Up on Boston Radio Hosts\n\nA different source close to the 37-year-old supermodel tells PEOPLE that B\u00fcndchen has \u201cbeen telling friends for a couple years now that she would like him to retire and just be able to be at home, but he is so committed to the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to retire after \u2018Deflategate,\u2019 \u201d the second source adds, referencing the 2015 scandal where Brady was issued a four-game suspension for his part in allegedly deflating footballs for an unfair advantage during an AFC championship game against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nThe source also reveals that \u201cafter the big surprise win last year\u201d when the Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl, B\u00fcndchen \u201cwas hopeful that he might want to go out on top, but he still wants to play.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody thinks he is going to want to go for at least one more season,\u201d the source adds.\n\nDespite Sunday\u2019s loss, Brady still had something to celebrate: He was named MVP for the third time in his NFL career, making him the oldest player to win the coveted award.", "images":
