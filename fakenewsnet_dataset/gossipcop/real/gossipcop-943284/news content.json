With her adorable big eyes and squeezable cheeks, we can\u2019t get enough of the little one, who is set to tun two-months old this week.\n\nkhloe kardashian // Instagram\n\n\u2018I cannot believe my girl is going to be two months old tomorrow,\u2019 the new mum tweeted last night. \u2018Where is the time going but at the same time, every milestone I look forward to! I'm on alert every day to hear her first giggle. I cant wait for the giggles!\u2019\n\nOver the weekend, the reality star and her NBA player beau made a rare public appearance together at a friend's birthday bash in Cleveland. The outing marked only a handful of times the new parents have been spotted out together since the 27-year-old athlete was accused of cheating on his girlfriend of more than a year.\n\n\u2018Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan were there together, they were sitting next to each other during dinner and there was no animosity between them,\u2019 a source told E! News. \u2018Everybody looked happy, normal and like they were having a great time.\u2019\n\nGetty Images\n\nLast week, the 33-year-old star was praised on social media for speaking honestly about the struggles of becoming a new mum and feeding her daughter breast milk.\n\n'Because I don\u2019t produce enough milk, I also have to give a bottle with every feeding,' Khloe wrote on her website and Twitter.\n\n'Mad respect to (Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian) for opening up about supplementing with formula,' one Twitter user wrote.\n\n'I had to do that when I went back to work, and I was so embarrassed that I couldn\u2019t produce enough because I was away from Jackson. Fed is best!'\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians star responded to the positive feedback and shared her own words of support regarding 'mummy shaming' relating to breastfeeding.\n\n\u2018Mummy shaming is real! But the truth is I\u2019ve tried and tried and tried to breast feed only and it wasn\u2019t working for me.\n\n\n\n'I feel fortunate that I am able to still breast-feed but with the help of formula. Breast-feeding is something I really wanted to do. Just am not fully able.'\n\nKhlo\u00e9\u2019s words come amid a statement from the Royal College of Midwives which states women who choose not to breastfeed they babies \u2018must be respected\u2019 for their decision.\n\nWe love your honesty, Khlo\u00e9!", "images":
