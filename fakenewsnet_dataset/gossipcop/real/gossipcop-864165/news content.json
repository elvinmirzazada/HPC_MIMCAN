Injecting silicone destroys the underlying tissues by causing a severe inflammatory response and becomes a chronic problem.\u201d\n\nThey also warn against seeking any sort of surgery outside of the USA to save money, as doctors may not be as qualified and things can easily go wrong.\n\nSign up for our newsletter!\n\nGet updates on the latest posts and more from Monsters and Critics straight to your inbox.
