Zambuto, CEO of the Joyful Heart Foundation, told the Huffington Post on Wednesday. \u201cHer team got in touch with me and we talked a lot about her commitment, all along throughout this ordeal, to wanting to be of service to survivors.\u201d\n\nZambuto did not reveal the specific amount of money Swift will give to the foundation, but said that the donation was an \u201cextremely generous financial investment in the movement to end sexual violence.\u201d\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/LP5/Getty Images for TAS\n\n\u201cI hope that Taylor\u2019s very public experience \u2015 and her decision to speak out \u2015 not only helps empower other victims to speak up and take action, but offers them solidarity,\u201d said Hargitay, who plays Detective Olivia Benson on the hit NBC show Law & Order: SVU.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored by her dedication and commitment to these issues, and I\u2019m deeply grateful for her support of the Joyful Heart Foundation.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, Hargitay founded the Joyful Heart Foundation, which has become a leading organization to help change societal responses to child abuse, domestic violence, and sexual assault while supporting survivors through the healing process.\n\nRELATED LINK: Taylor Swift Groping Trial: A Timeline of Everything That\u2019s Happened in Court\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Swift Victory! Jury Rules Former Radio Host Assaulted Taylor Swift During Meet and Greet, Awards Singer $1\n\nOn Monday, Swift released a statement to PEOPLE thanking the judge and jury \u201cfor their careful consideration,\u201d as well as her attorneys \u201cfor fighting for me and anyone who feels silenced by a sexual assault, and especially anyone who offered their support throughout this four-year ordeal and two-year long trial process.\u201d\n\n\u201cI acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this,\u201d she continued. \u201cMy hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.\u201d\n\nSwift was awarded $1 after a jury found former radio host David Mueller guilty of assault and battery against Swift for grouping her during a meet-and-greet photo session in June 2013.", "images":
