They offer a wide range of fragrance mists that suits everyone. However, choosing a perfume that matches your preferences can be puzzling. So, after consulting Blanka Crozier, Fragrance Collector and Critic, I have carefully picked a list of signature Victoria\u2019s Secret scents that will definitely lift your spirit. Check out this list of the 20 best Victoria\u2019s Secret perfumes with enchanting fragrances. Keep scrolling!\n\n20 Best Victoria\u2019s Secret Perfumes For Women \u2013 2023\n\n1. Best Overall: Bombshell Eau de Parfum\n\n4.5 Image: Victorias Secret\n\nThe best seller in Victoria\u2019s Secret perfume collection, Bombshell is a fruity floral scent also known as the \u2018LBD of Fragrance\u2019. The perfume contains notes of Purple Passion Fruit, Shangri-La Peony, and Vanilla Orchid that combine to give you a fragrance that is the perfect blend of flowers and fruits. Started as part of the original Bombshell collection, this fragrance is a favorite of everyone who loves fruity-floral scents. This delicious scent is subtle and perfect for regular use.\n\nProduct Dimensions: 3.6 x 3.6 x 4.8 inches | Weight: 8 Ounces\n\nPros\n\nNot overpowering\n\nPleasant fruity notes, suitable for people of all ages\n\nCons\n\nDoes not last long\n\nPro Tip Pro Tip To make the fragrance more prominent and long-lasting, spray it on your skin after using the Victoria\u2019s Secret Bombshell Fine Fragrance Lotion.\n\nBombshell Eau de Parfum Review\n\nKick-starting this list for today is everybody\u2019s eternal favorite from the Victoria\u2019s Secret Collection\u2014the Bombshell Eau de Parfum. With notes of Purple Passion Fruit, Shangri-La Peony and Vanilla Orchid, Bombshell is a subtle pleasure to the senses which very, very few perfumes have come close to in my humble opinion (Ferragamo\u2019s Incanto Shine being one of them). This pleasant fruity floral scent comes with no limits on what ages may or may not use it and is a hit with young girls and women alike for not being too overpowering. Also, thanks to the fact that it isn\u2019t what one would call a \u2018statement perfume\u2019, there are no restrictions on what time of the day, or in what sort of crowd one can use this perfume making it a winner all the way. My only complaint with this perfume is that it doesn\u2019t stay on for as long as one would\u2019ve liked, requiring constant reapplication. But if that doesn\u2019t pose a problem to you, Bombshell is one perfume that should definitely make it to your shopping list this season. To get a better understanding of this fragrance, check out this video on YouTube that details a tester\u2019s experience with the product.\n\nWhy We Think It's Worth Buying With over 1,876 reviews, this product has become a fan favorite among users.\n\n2.

A bestseller since its launch, this particular musky Victoria\u2019s Secret scent has undergone a revamp in recent times to make it more appealing to the new generation, though thankfully its intrinsic tones have remained the same. The new Heavenly now comes in a bottle that has angel wings on the cap and is embellished with tiny crystals\u2014an ode to their VS angel fashion show? That\u2019s what I\u2019m assuming too. But a nice touch nonetheless. Coming to the fragrance itself, I find that the notes of White Musk, Sandalwood, Vanilla, and White Peony lend it a striking warm essence that to me speaks elegance and sensuality. In fact, the sandalwood and musk, in addition to giving Heavenly a distinctly musky flavor, also lend to its longevity that Bombshell lacks, thus making it perfect for long-term wear. As a woman trying to make a subtle yet defining impression, there could hardly be an intense scent than this.

If you\u2019re looking for a fresh and alluring fragrance, this is an excellent choice. One of the distinctive qualities of this scent is its ability to be applied over complementing Love Fine Fragrance Lotion to provide a long-lasting fragrance impression. It is a great addition to any perfume collection, with its fresh and alluring scent and stylish packaging providing excellent value for the price. This distinctive signature is a must-have in every makeup essential.\n\nA zany mix of floral and spice, Victoria\u2019s Secret \u2018Crush\u2019 is a young, fresh scent that bottles the feeling of being addicted to someone. This summery fragrance is best for a family vacation perfume and comes in a no-fuss bottle. This season perfume is great if you are looking for refreshing the body and mind.\n\nProduct Dimensions: 2.76 x 2.76 x 3.94 inches | Weight: 14.11 Ounces\n\nPros\n\nSweetness isn\u2019t too overpowering\n\nCitrus base\n\nSummer go-to\n\nA youthful, fresh scent\n\nCons\n\nSeasonal perfume\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret Crush Perfume Review\n\nChanneling a whole lot of pink and a whole lot of cute in its packaging, Crush is Victoria\u2019s Secret offering for youngsters, and for the young at heart. With notes of Pink Peppercorn, Treasure Peony and Ashok flower, Crush takes you on a frosting filled trip to wonderland right from the first spritz. What I like best about this Crush fragrance is that though sweet and high on its own \u2018youthfulness\u2019, at no point is the sweetness too overpowering an attack on the senses. With a warm, citrus base, Crush makes for the perfect summer scent and considering I live in a tropical country, it comes in handy pretty much all year round. But that very seasonality is also a bane as people who live in colder areas might not find it much to their liking. So, do keep that in mind before you go out shopping for this one.\n\nP.S.- I bought this perfume for my niece last Christmas, and I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve chosen any better. This is why I now nominate Crush as the perfect gift for female members of your family this festive season too. Do let me know how that fares!\n\n4.6 Image: Victorias Secret\n\nDesigned as the consummate flirt, Victoria\u2019s Secret Tease is the result of what happens when a seductress meets a coquette\u2014a fragrance that is the ultimate in the art of seduction. This top-selling scent falls among the top flirtatious Victoria\u2019s Secret perfumes.\n\nProduct Dimensions: 3.94 x 2.76 x 3.94 inches | Weight: 1.06 Ounces\n\nPros\n\nBeautifully packaged\n\nNot harsh on the skin\n\nWarm scent\n\nCons\n\nLongevity is terrible\n\nNot travel-friendly\n\nNot suited to all age groups\n\nTease Eau de Parfum Review\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single thing I dislike about how Tease looks sitting on my vanity, a boudoir inspired fragrance that is an instant throwback to the parlors of France. The fishnet and lace packaging on the bottle coupled with the hot pink atomizer makes for some truly attractive packaging that I fell so in love with at first glance. Full marks to whoever came up with the design for this little baby. As for the fragrance itself, combining notes of Black Vanilla, Frozen Pear, and Blooming Gardenia, I find that coming to Victoria\u2019s Secret collection at least, this fragrance truly is the ultimate \u2018tease\u2019. A warm scent that I feel is better carried off by grown women, the major downer with this fragrance is its longevity. At barely an hour or two of staying power, Tease hardly lasts you for even a quarter of a day which is a shame as it has a pleasant dry down that I liked smelling for whatever little time it lasted. If longevity isn\u2019t a concern you have, Tease might just make another great gift this festive season, this time for the ladies of your family.\n\n4.6 Image: Victorias Secret\n\nSeduction in a bottle, Victoria\u2019s Secret Very Sexy has been a crowd favorite right since its launch in the early 2000s. A \u2018spicy\u2019 scent, it combines notes of Vanilla Orchid, Sun-drenched Clementine, and Midnight Blackberry.\n\nProduct Dimensions: 1.77 x 3.07 x 6.5 inches | Weight: 4.8 Ounces\n\nPros\n\nSpicy fragrance\n\nArousing (as reported by users)\n\nCons\n\nNot for regular wear\n\nStrong scent, to be used with a light hand\n\nVery Sexy Eau de Parfum Review\n\nHonest to heaven, I\u2019d like to tip my hat to whoever at Victoria\u2019s Secret came up with this fragrance. A strong, spicy scent that has undertones of Vanilla Orchid, Sun-drenched Clementine, and Midnight Blackberry, Very Sexy hasn\u2019t been taken off the shelves since its launch in the 2000s. Imagine! But smell it once, and it isn\u2019t too hard to understand why, as Very Sexy has a delectable peppery fragrance that exudes a strong come-hither scent that is difficult to resist, and (reportedly) is a crowd favorite with boyfriends and husbands alike. Be careful to use it with a light hand though as it is a strong perfume. Not suitable for regular wear either.\n\n4.5 Image: Victoria's Secret\n\nThe Victoria\u2019s Secret Very Sexy Sea Fine Fragrance Mist feels fresh like a day at the beach. The fragrance opens up with bright and refreshing notes of citrus bergamot and Neroli blossom. The sun-drenched cedar adds a dash of freshness and surrounds you with a not-so-overwhelming but lingering sultry scent.\n\nPros\n\nCan be easily layered\n\nNot overwhelming\n\nCons\n\nMight not last long without touch-ups\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret Very Sexy Sea Fine Fragrance Mist Review\n\nThe Very Sexy Sea Fine Fragrance Mist wraps you in a bitter-sweet fragrance.

Spray it once and enjoy the refreshing vigor all day long.\n\nThis body mist is a combination of fruits fresh at the market, evoking a memory of a vivid summer afternoon. With the infusion of essential oils, the fruity Victoria\u2019s Secret fragrance keeps you smelling and your skin feeling sunny and bright. This light scent is best for casual wear for a day out with friends.\n\nProduct Dimensions: 2 x 2 x 6 inches | Weight: 8.4 Ounces.\n\nPros\n\nFresh fruity fragrance\n\nSummer fragrance\n\nCons\n\nNone\n\nBerry Pop Body Mist Review\n\nDespite being a summer fragrance, Berry Pop Body Mist will have your heart all year round. With the amalgamation of the beautiful frozen strawberry, pink hibiscus, and amber crystals as its notes, the scent gives you fresh-juice feels that not only quenches your skin\u2019s thirst but also provokes your senses gently. This body mist is a fond fragrance to remember someone as it would bring back pleasant moments of joy, fun, and all things sunny. Wear this sweet-smelling scent for a day out with your girls or for a picnic with your family, and see yourself blush as the compliments pour in.\n\nThis fragrance is as light as air and is so captivating that it makes you impossible to forget.
