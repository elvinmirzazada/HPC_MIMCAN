Yes, acne always existed, even 100 years ago. I would say because of the dirt and the hygienic problems even more intense in the middle ages than now. Hormonal changes and stress trigger acne. You, of course, know it. Just if you have a date or a party, your bacteria make a big party on your face, too: you get a breakout.\n\nAcne most commonly appears on your face, but also on neck, chest, back and shoulders. I know, acne can be distressing and annoyingly persistent. I have a lot of patients in any age. The patient\u2019s age is ranging from 13, with a peak around their late 20s and even up to their mid-30s and 40s. Acne in the 40s is the so-called \u201clate-onset acne\u201d. But don\u2019t be afraid, don\u2019t give up. There are acne treatment solutions. It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated or expensive. But on the other side don\u2019t over-treat. Don\u2019t try too much, get help by a dermatologist before it is too late.\n\nDepending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress even depression and lead to scarring of your skin.\n\nThe lesson heal slowly and -if you are getting older- even slower. If one lesion begins to resolve, others seem to crop up, and old once are still visible as red and brown spots. Therefore, it\u2019s so important to treat them in the early stage. So don\u2019t give up, acne can be cured. There are effective treatments available (local cream treatments or with tablets). You might laugh, but so many of my patients harm themselves by using wrong fatty creams, by touching their face or by not washing their face the right way. (Check my video about \u201chow to wash your face right\u201d on Youtube, click here). Let\u2019s start with a series of blog sessions how to give you a glowing skin. Let\u2019s start with small steps. Here are some tips against new breakouts while sleeping:", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20200928045147im_/https://www.drliv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sleep-acne.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200928045147im_/https://www.drliv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-DrLiv-Logo-1.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200928045147im_/https://www.drliv.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sleep-acne.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liv Kraemer"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200928045147/https://www.drliv.com/avoid-acne-while-sleeping/", "title": "", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Do you suffer from acne?
