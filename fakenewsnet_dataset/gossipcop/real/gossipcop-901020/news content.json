USA TODAY\n\nDisney World is reopening its decades-old Hall of Presidents exhibit with a new addition: President Trump.\n\nOr should we say, Jon Voight?\n\nAfter a year of renovations, Disney Parks presents its new animatronic Trump on Tuesday in Orlando's Magic Kingdom park. And, of course, Twitter has thoughts on the robotic creation meant to look just like Trump.\n\nMany thought it resembled a certain Oscar winner\n\nSomeone took note of the other presidents' reaction to the new guy\n\nAnd there were those who commented that the character looked 'hideous'\n\nAs has been tradition since the early '90s, Trump recorded a speech exclusively for the Hall of Presidents show. This show has been a Disney attraction since a single animated figure of former president Abraham Lincoln was developed for the 1964-65 New York World\u2019s Fair.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5686865004001_5686857548001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/514922ee78c25e2bb90a92cf29ab3e31e5542750/c=0-153-3000-1848/local/-/media/2017/12/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636492282850247015-trump-hall1.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/514922ee78c25e2bb90a92cf29ab3e31e5542750/c=0-153-3000-1848/local/-/media/2017/12/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636492282850247015-trump-hall1.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carly Mallenbaum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/12/18/animatronic-trump-disney-hall-presidents-twitter-reaction/963529001/", "title": "Animatronic Trump joins Disney's Hall of Presidents, and Twitter thinks he looks like Jon Voight", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/12/18/animatronic-trump-disney-hall-presidents-twitter-reaction/963529001/life/entertainthis", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Animatronic Trump joins Disney's Hall of Presidents, and Twitter thinks he looks like Jon Voight", "description": "There are plenty of comparisons to the Oscar winner, and plenty of other Twitter jokes.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/514922ee78c25e2bb90a92cf29ab3e31e5542750/c=0-153-3000-1848/local/-/media/2017/12/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636492282850247015-trump-hall1.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "There are plenty of comparisons to the Oscar winner, and plenty of other Twitter jokes.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513548000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
