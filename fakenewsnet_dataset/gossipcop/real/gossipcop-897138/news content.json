His most notable Twitter moment was probably earlier this year, when he called out James Woods, who made a comment about the age difference between Hammer\u2019s character and his love interest, played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, in \u201cCall Me By Your Name.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you date a 19 year old when you were 60\u2026\u2026.?\u201d Hammer replied, spurring a response by actress Amber Tamblyn, who recalled Woods trying to pick up her and her friend when she was only 16.\n\nHammer\u2019s first response to the BuzzFeed article was a \u201cbitter AF\u201d tweet, which is, alas, now gone, along with everything else.\n\nThe article discusses the \u201cmany second chances\u201d Hammer has had in his career, saying the Hollywood system gives handsome, straight white men more chances than women and minorities.\n\nThe article was met with mixed reactions. Many agreed that Hollywood should be more diverse and inclusive, but took issue with personalizing that point by focusing on Hammer.\n\nNow, fans are lamenting the loss of Hammer\u2019s Twitter. Don\u2019t worry, though, his Instagram is still up and running.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/annaswnsn/status/935305942710870016\n\nhttps://twitter.com/clarkjoes/status/935385215161262080\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sweeteachalamet/status/935312419391524866\n\nYou all ran Armie Hammer off of Twitter. This is why we can't have nice things. \u2014 Astronaut Mike Dexter (@JustinCentric) November 27, 2017\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CertifiedErin/status/935270303453851658\n\nhttps://twitter.com/subsahaaron/status/935271455503216642\n\nThere are still fans who are pointing out that those defending Hammer should also defend women and people of color:\n\nwhite people take any mention of their privilege as a personal attack because they want to believe they got where they are purely through their own hard work, and to suggest otherwise is to ruin that illusion for them (THIS IS ABOUT ARMIE HAMMER) \u2014 kai (@plantblogger) November 27, 2017\n\n\u2013 I'm going to say this on this Armie Hammer Buzzfeed article \u2013 for the folks going hard in the paint defending him, ask yourself if you champion PoC actors/actresses as much. If you don't, then kindly STFU. Debate your mama. \u2014 Rebecca Theodore-Vachon ?? ?? ??
