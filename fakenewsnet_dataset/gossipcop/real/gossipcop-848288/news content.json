But Eden perhaps got a little too personal when she compared he relationship with her sister to the bond between Kyle Richards and her recovering addict sister Kim Richards \u2014 causing tension and headed arguments between the three.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: What Eden Sassoon Remembers Most from Tuff Turf Set with Kim Richards & Sister Catya\n\nThings got worse when Rinna told Eden that Kyle was an \u201cenabler\u201d and that Kim was \u201cclose to death\u201d\u2014 information that propelled Eden into trying to help Kim and Kyle (and, perhaps unfairly, only drove her further away from the group).\n\nBy season\u2019s end, Eden had turned on Rinna, telling her, \u201cI\u2019ve given you so much of my time, my energy \u2014 my f\u2014ing heart, you bitch! \u2026 It\u2019s not okay for you to treat me the way that you do. It\u2019s not okay for you to walk all over me and use me as your scapegoat. I\u2019ve been nothing but there for you to try to heal you!\u201d\n\nNow that she\u2019s off the show, Eden can spend her time focused on her two businesses \u2014 her full service salon, EDEN by Eden Sassoon, and two luxury Pilates studios in L.A.\n\nAnd while some may feel their departure from reality TV is the end, Eden sees it as a fresh start.\n\n\u201cRemember an END is just a NEW BEGINNING\u2026I will be in full force with #love #hugs #truth and #compassion which are all things that make me shine,\u201d she wrote on Facebook. \u201cSo if you can\u2019t handle my light .. please go be dim someplace else.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrateful for season 7 #RHOBH,\u201d she added on Twitter. \u201cIt brought me beautiful love from so many that I now have for life. It\u2019s the #journey not the #destination .\u201d", "images":
