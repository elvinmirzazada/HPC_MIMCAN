Speaking to NBC News, Owen described the chaotic scene as it unfolded.\n\n\u201cI was on the stage. I had just walked up on the stage with a couple friends of mine, including Luke Combs, another artist who had played earlier, and we were literally standing 50 feet from where Jason was on stage, and all of a sudden, you heard what sounded \u2013 it was kind of a think where you were like, \u2018Was that gunfire?\u2019 \u2013 and it got faster and faster, almost like it was an automatic rifle,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could hear it ringing off the rafters off the top of the stage. That\u2019s when you saw people fleeing. At that point, people on stage just started running everywhere possible. And it was pretty chaotic, for sure.\u201d\n\nOwen said he ran in the opposite direction of where his usual shelter would be, his tour bus, which was on the other side of the stage. \u201cSo I kind of just ran like everyone else. At one point, I was crouched down behind a cop car with about 20 other people that had come to the show, and everyone\u2019s asking if everyone\u2019s okay,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s blood on people, and you could see a couple folks on the street that looked like they\u2019d been shot lying there. It was chaotic. It was literally like a movie that you feel like you\u2019ve seen before that\u2019s not real life.\u201d\n\nAsked how long it felt like from when the shooting began \u2014 which a number of eyewitnesses said they first believed were fireworks to celebrate the end of the concert \u2014 to when it ended, Owen said it seemed like \u201cclose to 10 minutes.\u201d Speaking to CNN on Monday morning, Owen said that considering the 64-year-old shooter, who has been identified and confirmed dead, was on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay resort overlooking the festival grounds it was \u201clike shooting fish in a barrel, I hate to say that.\u201d\n\nOnce the barrage of fire in what has now become the largest mass shooting in U.S. history began Owen said he and his crew ran to their crew bus and lay on the floor as the shots continued to ring out. \u201cThat\u2019s mind-boggling,\u201d Owen said upon hearing that the incident had surpassed the 49 deaths from the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando. Owen was not able to gain access to his tour bus as of Monday morning because it was still part of the crime scene. \u201cI mean, it was chaos for a pure seven to 10 minutes,\u201d he told NBC.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Billboard.", "images": ["https://static.spin.com/files/2023/10/ska-do-240x160.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2023/10/1736168747-340x227.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2023/10/GettyImages-1658195963-240x160.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=913237892731778&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=", "https://static.spin.com/files/2023/10/iron-roses-240x160.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2017/10/jakeowen-1506949672.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2022/02/GettyImages-1341007403-340x213.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2023/09/Fender_MikeMcCready_Demo-12-340x227.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2018/07/mgm-lawsuit-shooting-victims-1531839873.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/73d3a19059aeb35dc88e078b5a2cf8b7?s=48&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://static.spin.com/files/2017/10/jakeowen-1506949672.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.spin.com/2017/10/las-vegas-shooting-jake-owen-account/", "title": "Las Vegas Shooting: Singer Jake Owen Describes Running From Stage, \"It Was Chaos\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Country singer Jake Owen performed just before Jason Aldean\u00a0on Sunday night (Oct. 1) and was standing on the side of the stage when a gunman opened fire", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Las Vegas Shooting: Singer Jake Owen Describes Running From Stage, \"It Was Chaos\"", "description": "Country singer Jake Owen performed just before Jason Aldean\u00a0on Sunday night (Oct. 1) and was standing on the side of the stage when a gunman opened fire", "url": "https://www.spin.com/2017/10/las-vegas-shooting-jake-owen-account/", "site_name": "SPIN", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.spin.com/files/2017/10/jakeowen-1506949672.jpg", "width": 636, "height": 421, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/spin", "published_time": "2017-10-02T13:11:21+00:00"}, "author": "Billboard", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@spin", "site": "@spin", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Billboard", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.3", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.spin.com/files/2023/08/cropped-logo-spin-s-340x340.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506949881.0, "source": "https://www.spin.com", "summary": ""}
