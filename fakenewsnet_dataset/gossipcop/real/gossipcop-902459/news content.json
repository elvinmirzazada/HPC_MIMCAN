Criss portrays the role of Versace's murderer Andrew Cunanan, the serial killer who also murder at least five people in a three-month time frame before killing himself on July 23, 1997.\n\nEdgar Ramirez, the actor who portrays the role of Versace in the series, also mentioned that aside from providing the details about the events leading to the murder, the show will also be able to help the
