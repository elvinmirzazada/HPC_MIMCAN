In honor of the organization's focus on boating, the Duchess went all out in a nautical-themed look, and fortunately for us, it's one outfit that won't break the bank...that is, if you can get your hands on the pieces.\n\nKate's wide-leg sailor-inspired trousers with gold detailing are from J.Crew, and while they have already sold out, like everything the Duchess touches, J.Crew's factory site has a look-a-like style in stock.\n\nBuy Now J.Crew Nautical Pants, $49.99\n\n\n\nHer tweed, pointy-toe heels, also from J.Crew, have sold out as well, but you can still shop Kate's Superga sneakers, which she changed into before stepping aboard the ship.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s J. Crew pumps. Getty Images\n\nThe sleek single-button white blazer is a piece that Kate's worn once before, while on the Royal Tour of Canada last fall. The older style is from Zara, and while it's no longer available, here's a similar jacket from J.Crew, and another from Nordstrom.\n\nFinally, the simple jewelry Kate wore for the event is still available, though at two drastically different price points. For those on a budget, take a look at Kate's much-beloved Mirabelle Lolita earrings; they'll cost you just \u00a335. Her Ballon Bleu de Cartier watch, on the other hand? They start around $4,600.", "images": ["https://www.townandcountrymag.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon",
