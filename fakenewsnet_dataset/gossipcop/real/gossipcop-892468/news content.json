Kim, I haven\u2019t talked to in a year.\u201d\n\nFormer stepdaughter Kim Kardashian West publicly supported Caitlyn\u2019s journey but cut ties after reading her book, which alleged Kris Jenner \u2014 Caitlyn\u2019s ex-wife and Kim\u2019s mom \u2014 knew more about her gender identity crisis than she\u2019s admitted.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want me in their lives, the bashed me pretty badly. It\u2019s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt,\u201d Caitlyn continued. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future holds. We will see.\u201d\n\nStill, the Olympic icon and Kris, 62, both attended daughter Kendall\u2019s 22nd birthday bash at Petit Taqueria restaurant in Los Angeles, along with Kim, 37, and sister Kourtney Kardashian, 38. (Pregnant sisters Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, 33, and Kylie Jenner, 20, skipped, continuing to keep low profiles.)\n\n\u201cKris and Caitlyn only had a brief interaction to say hello, but everyone seemed fine,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cThey were all focused on making it a special birthday for Kendall.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/joy-anna-duggar-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C158px%2C2000px%2C1338px&resize=420%2C281", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/dream-kardashian-walking.jpg?crop=0px%2C121px%2C2000px%2C1339px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/sarah-hyland-square1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1333px%2C891.84047619048px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/andrew-dice-clay1.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1332.7428571429px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/mary-jo-buttafuoco.jpg?crop=68px%2C25px%2C1107px%2C740px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kim-caitlyn.jpg?crop=0px%2C106px%2C800px%2C420px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/nicole-curtis.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1332.7428571429px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/ed-westwick.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1250px%2C836px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/oprah-winfrey-1-2000.jpg?crop=0px%2C23px%2C1333px%2C892px&resize=420%2C281"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kim-caitlyn.jpg?crop=0px%2C106px%2C800px%2C420px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michele Corriston"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750/http://people.com/tv/caitlyn-jenner-hasnt-spoken-kim-kardashian/", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Hasn't Spoken to Kim Kardashian in a Year", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1143086910", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner discussed her memoir,\u00a0Secrets of My Life", "keywords": "caitlyn jenner, kim kardashian, caitlyn jenner book, caitlyn jenner 2017, kim kardashian caitlyn jenner", "news_keywords": "caitlyn jenner, kim kardashian, caitlyn jenner book, caitlyn jenner 2017, kim kardashian caitlyn jenner", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Says She Hasn't Spoken to Kim Kardashian in a Year: 'It's Devastating'", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750/http://people.com/tv/caitlyn-jenner-hasnt-spoken-kim-kardashian/", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner discussed her memoir,\u00a0Secrets of My Life", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171108183750im_/http://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/kim-caitlyn.jpg?crop=0px%2C106px%2C800px%2C420px&resize=1200%2C630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-08T15:59:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-08T15:59:56+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@people", "creator": "@people"}, "application-name": "PEOPLE.com", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://people.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/a39c9d87d3ee529a684f7a5b3b557adc?s=16"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510156796.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
