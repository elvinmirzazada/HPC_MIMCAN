Why? Not only is he adorable, but he proved he's an absolute sweetie when he comforted this crying bridesmaid at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, and he's also shattering gender stereotypes by taking ballet classes.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton often share anecdotes about the little royal. Recently, Kate attended an event at the V&A and spoke to one of the venue's senior curators, Martin Barnes.\n\nAccording to Hello, Barnes explained to her that one of the featured photographers, William Henry Fox Talbot, \u2018wanted nature to draw its own picture on the paper instead of failing with the pencil\u2019. It struck a hilarious note with Kate as it reminded her of Prince George.\n\n\u2018She said, \u2018George would do that!\u2019 \u2013 that is blame the pencil, which was sweet,\u2019 Barnes told the magazine.\n\nBut more recently, William decided to share which Disney film Prince George loves the most - and to be honest, same.\n\nAt a recent royal engagement, the Duke of Cambridge was asked by a little boy what TV show Prince George likes to watch.\n\nWilliam responded: 'He quite likes The Lion King - he's watched that a few times.'\n\nOkay, it's not a TV show, but it's great to know that George loves classic Disney.\n\nSee more\n\nBut he is also a fan of animated movies, with William elaborating: 'He has watched some Lego movies as well... trying to keep him off the television is hard work!'\n\nWell we have to say, it sounds like Prince George has a great taste in films, which he has clearly inherited from his parents.\n\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 1, William and Kate revealed that their go-to television series is none other than Game of Thrones.\n\nSee? They're just like us.", "images": ["https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrQ6PjRxjJknCsx7g4bJp-415-80.jpg", "https://mos.fie.futurecdn.net/ialtcspla5bn7g19-16660944167397-250-80.png", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/marieclaireuk/missing-image.svg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrQ6PjRxjJknCsx7g4bJp-1200-80.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=756449714459937&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XGMbuyG5aseDpYSkUU7ziQ.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrQ6PjRxjJknCsx7g4bJp-1200-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jadie Troy-Pryde", "News Editor", "Anna-Louise Dearden", "Lauren Hughes", "Iris Goldsztajn", "Social Links Navigation"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/celebrity-news/prince-george-favourite-disney-film-623104", "title": "This is Prince George's favourite Disney film and we can relate", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2018-10-25T12:06:37+00:00", "description": "Prince William just revealed which Disney film that Prince George loves the most, and we're certain that you'll agree with him.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/gich8ywzch1659617848.png", "og": {"site_name": "Marie Claire UK", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrQ6PjRxjJknCsx7g4bJp-1200-80.jpg", "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "title": "This is Prince George's favourite Disney film and we can relate", "url": "https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/celebrity-news/prince-george-favourite-disney-film-623104", "description": "It's a classic"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MarieClaireUK/", "published_time": "2018-10-25T12:06:37Z", "modified_time": "2018-10-25T12:06:37Z"}, "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-post-id": "wfnvVYiXBcqSGoxE4MEnhr", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-10-25T12:06:37Z", "parsely-title": "This is Prince George's favourite Disney film and we can relate", "parsely-link": "https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/celebrity-news/prince-george-favourite-disney-film-623104", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrQ6PjRxjJknCsx7g4bJp.jpg", "parsely-section": "Celebrity News", "parsely-tags": "Category: Celebrity News,Category: News,serversidehawk", "parsely-author": "Jadie Troy-Pryde", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "marieclaireuk", "title": "This is Prince George's favourite Disney film and we can relate", "description": "It's a classic", "creator": "marieclaireuk", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrQ6PjRxjJknCsx7g4bJp-1200-80.jpg", "account_id": 9696142}, "google-site-verification": "yIeI3xewp1Vc5WrxptNtgP6GlK_oeSo-8hblyIcOYJg", "taboola": {"url": "https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/celebrity-news/prince-george-favourite-disney-film-623104"}, "botify-site-verification": "gEo2ltw4ZxjJkBcaADHlIGePpMrucY2w", "msvalidate.01": "CC462E6DF91492086145CA5EBDCB615E"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1540469197.0, "source": "https://www.marieclaire.co.uk", "summary": ""}
