In both interviews, Feldman talked about the prevalence of pedophilia in Hollywood and his desire to make a feature-length film that will tell the true story of his own experience with molestation as a child actor in the 80s.\n\nThe interviews follow the Indiegogo campaign that Feldman launched on Wednesday. The campaign aims to raise $10 million for the film and features a YouTube video of Feldman issuing a warning about the dangers of child molestation in Hollywood.\n\nForwarding the News Thoughtful, balanced reporting from the Forward and around the web, bringing you updated news and analysis of the crisis each day.

Feldman claims that he is afraid for both his physical and legal well-being.\n\n\u201cSomeone tried to kill me the other day. I have been arrested. This is no joke. I am fearing for my life,\u201d Feldman said to Kelly. \u201cI had two trucks come speeding towards me on the highway at the same time. I was with six other people. I have many witnesses to this. I\u2019m not saying they were trying to kill Corey Feldman but they were definitely trying to kill a group of people walking across the street.\u201d\n\nFeldman\u2019s campaign has raised, as of the time of publication, $161,000. He has two months to reach $10 million.\n\nBecky Scott is the editor of The Schmooze.
