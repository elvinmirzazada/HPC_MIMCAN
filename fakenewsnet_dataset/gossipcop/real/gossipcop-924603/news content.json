Another video showed the baby, born Feb. 1, cuddling up in the 25-year-old rapper\u2019s arms.\n\nIn the first public glimpse of the family all together \u2014 a video shared by fan accounts \u2014 Scott held Stormi facing him while Jenner cozied up beside her beau and reached out to lovingly stroke their daughter\u2019s head.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

I have nothing to do with any of that. People should be able to live in peace,\u201d said the hitmaker, who shares 5-year-old son King Cairo with ex-fianc\u00e9e Blac Chyna. (Chyna is also mom to Jenner\u2019s 16-month-old niece Dream Kardashian.)\n\nThe paternity claims first caused a frenzy in November 2017 when Tyga seemingly claimed to be the father of the child.\n\nKylie Jenner/Snapchat\n\nINSTARimages.com\n\nJenner and Scott, however, have been enjoying their time both as new parents and a couple. They have been making sure to have plenty of date nights from stepping out on a lunch date with friends and family at Nobu Malibu in February \u2014 where Jenner showed off her luxe push present, a black Ferrari La Ferrari \u2014 to snuggling together on a boat as they arrived at a restaurant in Miami last month.\n\nMost recently, they left their daughter at home to celebrate at a birthday dinner for Elizabeth Woods, the mom of Jenner\u2019s BFF Jordyn Woods. In a photo from the event, Scott adorably wrapped his arms around his girlfriend.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kylie Jenner Says Her Pregnancy Was \u2018Perfect\u2019 & Reveals That In-N-Out Was Not Her #1 Craving in Twitter Q&A\n\nThe couple, who have been dating since April 2017, aren\u2019t yet contemplating getting engaged, though, a source previously told PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not anything that Kylie seems to be focused on,\u201d the insider explained.\n\nHowever, the new mom has been sporting a symbol of their relationship \u2014 a diamond ring on her left ring finger with the initials \u201cJW,\u201d for Scott\u2019s birth name, Jacques Webster.", "images":
