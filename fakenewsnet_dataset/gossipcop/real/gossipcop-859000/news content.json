Instead, the two long-married country-music stars have developed a manner of speaking that can only be described as down-right harmonious, with each supplying an instrumental part of the whole. Consider, for example, the way they talk about the first time they saw the future site of their beloved Bahamas home. \u201cThere was just a little shack,\u201d McGraw recalls, \u201cthat someone\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were friends of the owner,\u201d Hill interjects. \u201c\u2014\u2014had sort of floated up onto the beach.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a great little place.\u201d\n\n\u201cA great little place,\u201d he agrees, \u201cand it was the only thing there. When we decided to buy, they just floated the shack away. . . .\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, the couple\u2019s own settling-in process was a bit more involved. Hill and McGraw first purchased the private 20-acre island they call \u201cL\u2019\u00eele d\u2019Anges\u201d back in 2003; they didn\u2019t move into the house\u2014actually a collection of eight distinct \u201cpavilions,\u201d connected by thatch-roofed loggias\u2014until 2012. \u201cWe were a little bit naive, possibly,\u201d Hill admits, \u201cas to what\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014\u2014what the undertaking really meant,\u201d McGraw concludes.\n\n'The house is functional, but it really blends into the environment,' says McGraw.\n\n\u201cWe set out to build a house. We had no idea we had to build everything else.\u201d She laughs. \u201cWe basically had to build a little town.\u201d\n\nPhoto by William Abranowicz\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have staff houses,\u201d he says, meaning shelter for the original construction workers as well as the current caretakers. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have infrastructure.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/593ab49258381603535673b7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/AD%252007.17%2520COVER.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee233077afe6e41db3930/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/0717-AD-HILL06-01.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/654147f122d1febf6dc58a06/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/65563032c2a43aff537c1459/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee234077afe6e41db3933/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/0717-AD-HILL06-02.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/59383e3e3176b35c589a6b0d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Exteriors_1817.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-ad-us-reverse.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee2276577bc169da97bc8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/0717-AD-HILL07-01.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/655678efbc762f411b55fd77/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-ad-us.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/6557815c0629e7594a2b817d/1:1/pass/undefined", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee232077afe6e41db392c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0717-AD-HILL02-01.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee234077afe6e41db3934/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/0717-AD-HILL06-03.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee234077afe6e41db3936/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/0717-AD-HILL09-9A.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/account-avatar.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee232077afe6e41db392c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0717-AD-HILL02-01.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Lauren Waterman", "William Abranowicz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/faith-hill-tim-mcgraw-bahamas-home", "title": "Inside Faith Hill and Tim McGraw's Bahamas Home", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2023", "description": "On their own private island in the Bahamas, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw create the perfect escape designed by McAlpine", "id": "592ed01f077afe6e41db38f4", "keywords": "tim mcgraw,faith hill,bahamas,july 2017,instagram,longform", "news_keywords": "tim mcgraw,faith hill,bahamas,july 2017,instagram,longform", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "592ed01f077afe6e41db38f4", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"On their own private island in the Bahamas, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw create the perfect escape designed by McAlpine\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee2266577bc169da97bc4/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/0717-AD-HILL05-01.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee2266577bc169da97bc4/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/0717-AD-HILL05-01.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "On their own private island in the Bahamas, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw create the perfect escape", "image": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee232077afe6e41db392c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0717-AD-HILL02-01.jpg", "site_name": "Architectural Digest", "title": "Inside Faith Hill and Tim McGraw's Bahamas Home", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/faith-hill-tim-mcgraw-bahamas-home"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-06-05T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-15T12:00:00.000Z", "author": "Lauren Waterman,William Abranowicz"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ArchDigest", "description": "On their own private island in the Bahamas, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw create the perfect escape", "domain": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "image": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee232077afe6e41db392c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0717-AD-HILL02-01.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@ArchDigest", "title": "Inside Faith Hill and Tim McGraw's Bahamas Home"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/592ee232077afe6e41db392c/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/0717-AD-HILL02-01.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 267091300008193, "pages": 43794751042}, "google-signin-client_id": "960933707988-c28a5u0f04t7r9sdmr2u8ct9tioi4m1n.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496664000.0, "source": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "summary": ""}
