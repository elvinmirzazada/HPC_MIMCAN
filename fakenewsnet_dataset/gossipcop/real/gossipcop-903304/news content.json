Not Fox\u2018s The Four: Battle for Stardom, apparently.\n\nThursday marked the two-hour series premiere of television\u2019s newest singing competition, which begins with four finalists hand-selected by the show\u2019s judges \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, DJ Khaled, Meghan Trainor and record executive Charlie Walk \u2014 and invites hungry competitors to compete for a chance to steal one of those spots.\n\nI use the word \u201chungry,\u201d because, well, it\u2019s a word that\u2019s used a lot on this show \u2014 particularly by Diddy, who treats the Four like a pack of wild animals. \u201cWho wants to eat?!\u201d he taunts them before each challenge. \u201cWho\u2019s hungry?!\u201d (Honestly, this show might as well put the singers in a damn cage at this point.)\n\nIn fact, Diddy said a few curious things during Thursday\u2019s premiere, including this not-so-subtle dig at American Idol, returning (to ABC!) in March: \u201cThis show is going to give you the reality of what it\u2019s about. Attention, America: No karaoke singers. This is not that show. \u2026 I want this show to be a true reflection of this industry.\u201d\n\nIronically, the show chose to introduce its original Four \u2014 female rapper Lex Lu, \u201csassy\u201d songstress Elanese Lansen, singer-songwriter Blair Perkins, and potentially British musician Ash Minor \u2014 with a group performance of Justin Timberlake\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling,\u201d arguably one of today\u2019s most karaoke\u2019d songs.\n\nDespite Fergie\u2019s most earnest hosting efforts, the two-hour premiere was relatively uneventful, save for the discuss-able moments below:\n\n* Los Angeles native Zhavia \u2014 who could very well just be Bella Thorne in a wig \u2014 earned the first unanimous \u201cyes\u201d from the judges with a performance of Khalid\u2019s \u201cLocation,\u201d allowing her to challenge Elanese, ultimately stealing her spot in the Four.\n\n* Young rapper Illakriss didn\u2019t get too much love from the judges at first, but Lex Lu practically begged them to let him through. She was hungry \u2014 and she devoured him, retaining her seat.\n\n* Saeed Renaud\u2019s soulful performance of Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cRun To You\u201d earned him the opportunity to challenge Blair, who chose to sing Sam Smith\u2019s \u201cStay With Me.\u201d Unfortunately for Blair, he did not stay; he had to give up his seat to Saeed.\n\nTell us: Did you enjoy your first experience with The Four?
