After all, she was Posh Spice in the Spice Girls \u2014 still is! \u2014 and she went on to launch her very own eponymous fashion label in 2008. The line has gone on to great success: She shows at New York Fashion Week every season, collaborates with Est\u00e9e Lauder on a beauty line and most recently, announced a partnership with Reebok to create an athleisure collection.\n\nHowever, while the 44-year-old has attained quite a few accolades in her decade as a designer, there are still a few in the fashion world who don\u2019t consider her one of their own. Case in point: Dolce & Gabbana co-designer Stefano Gabbana.\n\nThanks to the detective skills from Comments by Celebs\u2019 Twitter account, the Dolce & Gabbana designer commented on an Instagram photo Vogue Brazil\u2018s posted to wish Beckham a happy 44th birthday with three thumbs down emojis.\n\nVittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty\n\nAlthough the two were friends back in the day \u2014 they were seen out in Italy together in 2008 in the photo above \u2014 as she built her design empire, he was not sold on her and her label\u2019s rising success. \u201cShe\u2019s a friend. She make a good job but\u2026 for us, she don\u2019t make the same way like a fashion designer,\u201d Gabbana told the Telegraph in 2014. \u201cShe\u2019s a fashion designer but it\u2019s another\u2026 it\u2019s different. John Galliano is a designer\u2026 Alexander McQueen.\u201d\n\nIt was also reported that Gabbana\u2019s design partner Domenico Dolce compared her brand to the likes of commercial retailers like Zara and H&M.\n\nDavid Beckham Reveals: What Wife Victoria Really Thinks of His Sexiest Man Alive Title\n\nBoth Dolce and Gabbana are not afraid of being explicitly controversial. In the past, they\u2019ve sparked debate due to negative comments about gay parenting.\n\n\u201cWe oppose gay adoptions,\u201d Dolce, who is openly gay, told Panorama magazine in 2015. \u201cThe only family is the traditional one \u2026 No chemical offsprings and rented uterus; Life has a natural flow, there are things that should not be changed.\u201d\n\nThey also called IVF \u201cunnatural.\u201d\n\nThe brand also came under fire last year when they supported Melania Trump\u2019s decision to wear Dolce & Gabbana in her first official portrait. He received backlash on Instagram with commenters weighing in on gay rights.\n\nAnother former fan, @mademoiselle.myriam, wrote, \u201cThe LGBT community have been fighting so hard against these people for their rights. How can you. Unfollow, boycott.\u201d The designer fought back saying, \u201c@mademoiselle.myriam vai a cagare!! Ti boicotto io la testa cretina,\u201d the beginning of which translates to \u201cgo to hell.\u201d\n\nShe followed up with him asking to speak in English, only to get the response: \u201c@mademoiselle.myriam no!! Im italian.\u201d\n\nAnother commenter wrote: \u201cSo you have lost a follower, and worst, an admirer \ud83d\ude14\u201d wrote _boyafraid_. Gabbana responded by saying, \u201c@_boyafraid_ i don\u2019t care!! Really \u2764\u201d\n\n@_boyafraid_ even followed up by asking,\u201d Really? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f And Stefano wrote back, \u201c@_boyafraid_ yes.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/VIytihh0J0WRZztv9L39zDnBwtE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x539:1021x541)/kim-kardashian-larsa-pippen-1-75a96a4f7e2d4548b1e0b20201935d74.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/95TbjSyt1lP_WhTXzxcPaxoukCo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/david-victoria-beckham-double-denim-042423-1-4df119b0fc324f28ac46f2db9df6608b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/WasejyMRS-53N4npfE0ncsjXpFw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x509:921x511)/david-victoria-beckham-kids-1-4ca32f3350bc49599d812f24f0b9e035.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9ZnQ2oTVolgcqlT8WWkhKKSDhDA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1019x584:1021x586)/ringo-starr-kids-1-d1186455ef3a4f3199d644da1fff30aa.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2snmKHYVchR0j-GjE3cWRFv9CNM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1039x569:1041x571)/eva-longoria-jose-baston-tout-4bb49efc157147b8836c3718267dba04.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/S0_otrGO2ASCidKf_K4-5kedOxQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(725x117:727x119)/margaret-qualley-wedding-jack-anatonoff-081923-new-1-891f80e9b9d94c87b9b4b063a9bc3430.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/5KLdP91M6S1OsFxmNauSA0_0WRE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(781x299:783x301)/brooklyn-beckham-2-58a1a5ee7d874e1793ba5e4b6245b552.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/521dsmVajzb6XR3DvWQRSXU0Fic=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(438x287:440x289)/david-harper-beckham-the-weeknd-concert-080822-e84aaeb570ca4a728d32f8af02c1980e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/xpVPZdHXflkoPqzd2HyUenFEv1M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/mgk-fox-2-88d62bb3e8e045169ff5d50bdc058a22.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/YBMGliVh1bQXmrb6dY1BFn7T6Pw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(724x325:726x327)/thomas-rhett-disney-world-092223-tout-6b70099150384a9cb50d6b99e39c03c7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Eqk0JhbEWHWsLHPwYwXzmGVrFbQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(333x92:335x94)/gabrielle-union-wade-vacation-gallery-050523-1-1f871cad8a3e4c6caeeb97f63ef48364.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/wT51cJ2YAtrN8v4F6f4TpSfjCZM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x338:981x340)/matthew-mcconaughey-camila-alves-1-5a413f18ab844252b3fbc854755a6de8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/974oyAJrR3wpcmTdIvwoZQ-voEU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(647x175:649x177)/eric-jessie-james-decker-050123-3-0b147d3cb9524a539e129f0efe3097b7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/PJayfRPLkXdhrBL27Me_GaAOX7I=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(773x399:775x401)/david-victoria-beckham-1-7394f507e88048bfa8531f85e5cd6bbb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Ok4id3NNEFIAWzy1gnJoSFTgKQY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(979x284:981x286)/kim-kardashian-iconic-looks-main-split-1bec6f1a3df94740906929bd1da8c79e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tUNoLdna3QkyvHjDHjAtT6tQseE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(654x0:656x2)/victoria-beckham3-1-21f0a3f44c8c4f43848188a4c760c711.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/aGe4lqsxFWKZ9uCJfh-GCvDeLQM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x332:1001x334)/met-gala-themes-042523-tout-aec0babd0500425ba0b93beab749aa9b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/tUNoLdna3QkyvHjDHjAtT6tQseE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(654x0:656x2)/victoria-beckham3-1-21f0a3f44c8c4f43848188a4c760c711.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colleen Kratofil", "Colleen Kratofil Is A Former Style Editor At People.
