I do have someone who is very, very good at twerking, and she helped me,\u201d she says. \u201cI never realized how flexible you have to be to do that stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy teacher was like, \u2018I really suggest you take yoga,\u2019 and I didn\u2019t know you had to take yoga to be a twerker, but apparently you do.\u201d\n\nFrom Coinage: This Is How Long You\u2019ll Have To Work To Make As Much Money As Rihanna\u2019s Hit \u2018Work\u2019\n\nAnd as Azalea has said before \u2014 the butt you see is all-natural. Though the singer did reveal that she had breast implants and a nose job, she shot down a Wild \u2018N Out star who questioned her rear end\u2019s authenticity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna put you up on game,\u201d she said in August. \u201cIt\u2019s real in your hands, but ya\u2019ll don\u2019t need to be worrying about booty that\u2019s above your weight class.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/scheana-shay.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C1311px%2C877px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/fed-is-best-series-5.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1332.7428571429px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/iggy-azalea-2.jpg?w=798&h=515&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/half-their-size-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1500px%2C1003.5714285714px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/iggy-azalea-2.jpg?crop=55px%2C0px%2C687px%2C515.25px&resize=660%2C495&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/honey-boo-boo-mama-inset.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/richard-simmons-6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1428px%2C955.4px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/http://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/641185.jpg?crop=229px%2C203px%2C1014px%2C679px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/https://i2.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/kim-zolciak2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1338.0952380952px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/http://i1.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/half-their-size-5.jpg?crop=4px%2C0px%2C1992px%2C1332.7428571429px&resize=420%2C281&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341im_/http://i0.wp.com/peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/iggy-azalea-2.jpg?crop=55px%2C0px%2C687px%2C515.25px&resize=660%2C495&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Mazziotta"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407200341/http://people.com/bodies/iggy-azalea-lost-15-lbs-twerking/", "title": "Less Bounce?
